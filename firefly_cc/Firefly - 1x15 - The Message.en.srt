329
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,292
- Did he find out?
- Oh, next morning, he wakes up.

330
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:23,420
It's gone, and he is furious.

331
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:26,625
- But he can't just say, you know,
"Someone stole my mustache!"
- [ Laughter]

332
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,635
So, he, uh,
calls together all the platoons.

333
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,762
We thought he was gonna shoot us.

334
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:34,966
Oh, he's eyeballin' all the men
something fierce. Not a word.

335
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:38,136
And he comes up to Tracey, and Tracey's
wearing the gorram thing on his face!

336
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:41,306
- [ Laughter]
- He had glued it on.

337
00:20:41,381 --> 00:20:44,942
He's staring the old man down
wearing his own damn moustache.

338
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:46,952
[ Chuckles ]

339
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,488
Ha. Oh. Oh, God.

340
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,356
- Well, the colonel must've said some--
- [ Explosion ]

341
00:20:53,427 --> 00:20:55,987
- Are we hit?
- That's too damn close.

342
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:00,092
- [ Beeping ]
- They're behind us.

343
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,101
Fired over the port bow.

344
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,103
- Warning shot?
- They coulda hit us.

345
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:07,538
- Feds.
-This is Lieutenant Womack
of Allied Enforcement.

346
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:10,406
You are in possession of stolen goods
and are ordered...

347
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,411
to cut thrust and prepare for docking.

348
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,242
- The Lassiter.
- That was quick.

349
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,215
Do you think Saffron tipped them off?

350
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:20,048
This is Captain Reynolds.
I think there's been a mistake.

351
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,088
There's been a lot of mistakes,
Captain.

352
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,589
The latest of which
is you taking that crate.

353
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,888
[ Whispers ]
Crate?

354
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,394
Um, we took in
a lot of inventory today.

355
00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:32,591
If something got mixed in,
we'll be sure and hand it back.

356
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,601
I don't think we're your men. Let me check
through the cargo. Is it marked at all?

357
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,934
I'd think twice about
playing games with me there, mister.

358
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,940
I will blow you to pieces.

359
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh, you do that, your precious crate
gonna be in bitty shards.

360
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:47,444
Now, I got deliveries to make, Officer,
so you just lock onto my trajectory...

361
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,779
and I'll take a look here, see if
anything matches your description.

362
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,876
Police procedure has changed
since I was little.

363
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:54,887
He calls back,
you keep him occupied.

364
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:58,186
- What do I do, shadow puppets?
- We'll take care of it.

365
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:00,055
I don't get this.
They're after Tracey?

366
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:02,061
Unless there's something else
in that box.

367
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:05,598
Anything?

368
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,965
Not unless this crate's
made of magical wish-granting planks.

369
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,800
- Check his pockets.
- That ain't right.

370
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,306
Neither's being blowed up.

371
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,604
There's nothing about this
sits right with me.

372
00:22:16,677 --> 00:22:19,578
- Empty.
- They want this body for something...

373
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:21,910
and I'm guessin'
it ain't a proper burial.

374
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:28,147
Well, Doctor,
guess you are doing an autopsy.

375
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,950
[ Zoe ] You really think
there's something in there?

376
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:36,427
Using corpses for smuggling
is a time-honored repulsive custom.

377
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:38,225
Maybe it's gold.

378
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:42,667
And maybe he was a friend of ours,
and you need to show a little respect.

379
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,832
I got respect.
I'm just saying-- gold.

380
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,241
- He's been opened before.
- How's that?

381
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,243
It's, uh, good work.

382
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:57,408
Scar's nearly invisible, but--

383
00:22:57,484 --> 00:23:00,453
Well, let's see what's in there.

384
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:06,356
[ Screams ]

385
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,424
- [ Yells ]
- [ Mal ] Get ahold ofhim.

386
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:14,660
Spry for a dead fella.

387
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:17,363
[ Grunts, Groans ]

388
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,964
- Settle down! Settle! That's enough!
- [ Groans ]

389
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,305
- He was cutting on me, Sarge!
- I know it! I told him to!

390
00:23:23,377 --> 00:23:25,174
You told him to?
What for?

391
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:27,475
- 'Cause you were dead!
- Huh?

392
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:30,015
Oh. Right.
[ Wheezes ]

393
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,278
I suppose I was.

394
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,549
- Hey, there, Zoe.
- Private.

395
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,022
- You feelin' a mite calmer now?
- Yes, Sarge.

396
00:23:40,227 --> 00:23:43,060
- Um, Sarge--
- Yeah?

397
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,621
I think I'm nekkid.

398
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:49,001
[ Groans ]

399
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,399
Oh, um, sorry for jumping on you
the way I did.

400
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,408
I was a little confounded.

401
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,070
Emerging from that state
can be disorienting.

402
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,080
- Was it Bifodan?
- Hmm?

403
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,173
Can you bring that pan, please?

404
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,242
The drug you took to make it appear
as though you were dead.

405
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,083
- Remember what it was called?
- Never did ask.

406
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,216
Guy who sold it to me
said I'd be under a week or so.

407
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:16,353
He told me I wouldn't dream, but I did.
I dreamt of my family.

[ Retching ]

409
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:25,064
- You can take that.
- [ Mal ] All right.

410
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:29,199
You wanna explain to me exactly why you got
yourself corpsified and mailed to me?

411
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:33,440
- What are you running from?
- Running to, not from.

412
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,606
I just wanted to get home, that's all.

413
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,276
It's all I ever wanted.

that take exception to that...

- Was it gold?

who'd you boost it from?

Sure.

- Thank you.
- So your innards ain't your innards?

435
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,524
They got scooped out,
replaced every bit.

00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,794
What'd you wanna
go and do that for?

437
00:26:01,868 --> 00:26:06,032
For the money. They're paying me
to transport what they stuck in.

438
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,472
You're smuggling human organs?

439
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:12,808
They're grown in a lab. The only way they can
move 'em is in a person. Not sure why.

440
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:16,406
Because the technology's not ready.
Blastomeres are unapproved...

441
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:18,451

00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:21,214
You're not just a carrier.
You're an incubator.

00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,883
I was supposed to be at the drop spot
two weeks ago-- a clinic in Ariel.

444
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,054
They were to open me up, take out the goods,
and put my own organs back.

445
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,654
- So what happened?
- Better offer.

446
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:35,326
Another buyer was willing to go
three times the going rate.

447
00:26:35,402 --> 00:26:39,532
It's enough so I could get my folks off that rock
they've been forced to live on...

448

set them up someplace better,
someplace warm.

That's real nice.

But your better offer went south?

451
00:26:48,548 --> 00:26:50,743
Yeah. I got myself
in a little bit of a pickle, Sarge.

The folks I was working for...

453
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:55,078
must've got wind of what I had planned.

454
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,591
I, uh, showed up.
My new buyer was dead...

455
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,592
and there were some men
waiting for me.

456
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,494
- But you got away.
- Only just.

457
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:09,558
I knew they'd never stop looking for me
so long as I was alive.

458
00:27:09,636 --> 00:27:12,434
Thought my chances
would be better if I weren't.

459
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:16,202
So you died,

00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:15,323

to get to that one you got in your hold.

You play this right, and yours
won't have to be among them.

Come on.

00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,676
We'd love to let you dock,
but that last bop you gave us...

479
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:30,409
knocked out our fore couples, so we're gonna
have to park it if you want the tour.

480
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:34,579
[ Womack ] All right, Captain.
We can do this on the ground just as easy.

- Watch me.

00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:12,957
- So I-- I can let go of you now?
- Oh, you can.

00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:21,936
There's a fed station 80 miles
from where you're standing.

657
00:39:22,012 --> 00:39:25,709
You got your command stripes
at the Silver Hold colonies.

658
00:39:25,783 --> 00:39:30,049
Puts you about eight sectors
away from your jurisdiction.

659
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:34,551
Since you're running this job
on the side...

660
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:37,822
you took pains
to keep your presence here a secret.

661
00:39:37,895 --> 00:39:40,159
I don't imagine
it would bother anyone...

662
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,326
if we laid your bodies to rest
at the bottom of one of these canyons.

663
00:39:44,401 --> 00:39:46,892
[ Guns Cocking ]

664
00:39:59,383 --> 00:40:01,647
It's damaged goods anyhow.

665
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,414
[ Spits ]

666
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,724
That hat makes you look like an idiot.

667
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:22,095
[ Coughs ]
So, that was the plan?

668
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:27,667
That was, uh--
That was a good plan.

669
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:30,179
- [ Wheezes ]
- I think so.

670
00:40:30,247 --> 00:40:33,944
Um, you--

671
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:38,113
You weren't that far off
about me being stupid and I--

672
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:41,248
I never could
get my life working right...

673
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:43,259
not once after the war.

674
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:52,530
Kaylee, um, I'm so sorry.
I-- I didn't--

675
00:40:55,806 --> 00:40:57,467
- Sarge.
- Right here.

676
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,977
[ Wheezing Cough ]
Um...

677
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:04,309
you-- that stupid message of mine...

678
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:07,908
and I was trying to play you guys.

679
00:41:07,985 --> 00:41:11,148
And now--
[ Whimpers ]

680
00:41:13,957 --> 00:41:17,654
You'll-- You'll do it?
You'll-- You'll get me home?

681
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:20,822
- Yeah.
- [ Exhales Deeply ]

682
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,832
Yeah. You know the old saying.

683
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,334
[ Chuckles ]

684
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:27,927
[ Mutters ]

685
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:33,405
When you can't run, you crawl...

686
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:35,502
and when you can't crawl, you--

687
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,570
when you can't do that--

688
00:41:37,648 --> 00:41:40,981
You find someone to carry you.

689
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,320
[ Breathes Deeply ]

690
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:00,960
[ Tracey ]
You know, it's funny.

691
00:42:01,038 --> 00:42:03,233
We went to the war
never looking to come back.

692
00:42:03,307 --> 00:42:07,038
but it's the real world
I couldn't survive.

693
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:16,052
[ Tracey Continues ]
You two carried me through that war...

694
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:20,385
and now I need you to carry me
just a little bit further... if you can.

695
00:42:37,207 --> 00:42:39,198
Tell my folks
I wanted to do right by them...

696
00:42:39,276 --> 00:42:41,506
and that I'm at peace and all.

697
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:11,640
When you can't run anymore,you crawl,
and when you can't do that, well--

698
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:16,372
Yeah,you know the rest.

699
00:43:57,154 --> 00:44:00,089
Grr! Arrgh!
