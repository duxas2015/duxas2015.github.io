happened.Jokes that we never--

667
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,559
It was a code.

668
00:46:42,627 --> 00:46:44,652
it just said...

669
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:49,799
"They're hurting us.

670
00:46:52,003 --> 00:46:54,028
Get me out."

671
00:46:56,174 --> 00:46:58,165
[ Zoe ]
How'd you do it?

672
00:46:59,944 --> 00:47:02,742
Money.

673
00:47:02,814 --> 00:47:04,748
And-- And luck.

674
00:47:04,816 --> 00:47:07,842
For two years
I couldn't get near her.

675
00:47:07,919 --> 00:47:12,185
Then I was contacted by some men--
some underground movement.

676
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:16,216
They-- They said that
she was in danger, that--

677
00:47:16,294 --> 00:47:20,390
that the government was...
playing with her brain.

678
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:24,396
if I funded them, they could
sneak her out in cryo...

679
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:28,701
get her to Persephone, and from there
I could take her... wherever.

680
00:47:28,773 --> 00:47:31,071
Will she be all right?

681
00:47:31,142 --> 00:47:33,133
I don't know if she'll be all right.

682
00:47:33,211 --> 00:47:35,202
I don't know what they did to her.

683
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,578
Or why.

684
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:40,447
I-- I just have to keep her safe.

685
00:47:44,789 --> 00:47:46,757
That's quite a story, son.

686
00:47:46,824 --> 00:47:49,418
Yeah. It's a tale of woe.
Very stirring.

687
00:47:49,494 --> 00:47:52,361
In the meantime,you've heaped
a world of trouble on me and mine.

688
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,092
- I never thought--
- No, I don't imagine you thought.

689
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:58,226
In consequence of which we got
a kidnapped federal officer on board...

690
00:47:58,303 --> 00:48:00,863
we got the Alliance hard
on our trail and Kaylee--

691
00:48:00,938 --> 00:48:02,872
How much does the Alliance know?

692
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,068
I can't say. I killed the message pretty quick,
so they may just have our position.

693
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:09,204
Or they might have personal profiles
on each and every one of us.

694
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,272
- Till that fed wakes up, we won't know.
- So what do we do?

695
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,285
The job. We finish the job.

696
00:48:19,357 --> 00:48:22,224
I got word from Patience. She's waiting
for us. We circle round to Whitefall...

697
00:48:22,293 --> 00:48:25,922
make the deal, get out, keep flying.

698
00:48:28,132 --> 00:48:29,724
What about us?

699
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:34,670
Kaylee comes through,
you and your sister get off at Whitefall.

700
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:37,503
If she doesn't come through?

701
00:48:37,575 --> 00:48:40,408
Well, then you're
getting off a mite sooner.

702
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:42,673
- That'd be murder.
- Boy made a decision.

703
00:48:42,747 --> 00:48:44,840
- He didn't shoot her.
- No, but somebody else did...

704
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:47,146
and I'm scratching my head
as to why we ain't dealt with him.

705
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:49,812
Kill a fed? Can you think of
a stupider thing to do?

706
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:51,912
- He can I.D. us.
- Throw me out the air lock. Fine.

707
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:53,820
But River is not a part of this.

708
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:57,292
- Can we maybe vote on the whole
murdering people issue?
- We don't vote on my ship.

709
00:48:57,362 --> 00:48:59,796
- My ship is not the rutting town hall.
- This is insanity.

710
00:48:59,864 --> 00:49:02,332
I think we're
a ways beyond that now, sir.

711
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,459
- We're gonna talk this through.
- I will not sit by...

- [ Chinese ]

We gotta deal with what's in front of us.

716

Mal, you know those two wouldn't
survive a day in Whitefall anyway.

You throw them out, I'm leaving too.

You ain't a part of this business.

Is it gold?

Drugs? Pirate treasure?

724
00:49:58,022 --> 00:50:00,718
What is it that makes you
so afraid of the Alliance?

725
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:03,989
You don't want to go down
this road with me, boy.

726
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:05,722
Oh, you're not afraid of them?

727
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:10,257
I already know you'd sell me out
to them for a pat on the head.

Hell, you should probably be working
for them. You certainly fit the profi--

00:50:33,691 --> 00:50:37,218
I'm in a tricky position.
I guess you know.

Got me a boatload of terribly strange folk
makin' my life a little more interesting...

Chief among them
an Alliance mole--

734
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:50,433
likes to shoot at girls when he's nervous.

735
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:53,500
Now I gotta know
how close the Alliance is...

736
00:50:53,578 --> 00:50:57,480
exactly how much you told them
before Wash scrambled your call.

737
00:50:59,317 --> 00:51:03,879
So... I've given Jayne here
the job of finding out.

738
00:51:03,955 --> 00:51:05,946
He was nonspecific as to how.

739
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:09,889
Now you're only gonna scare him.

740

- Pain is scary.
-Just do it right.

how much trouble you're in?

Gee, I never been in trouble
with the law before.

No, not like this you haven't.
You think this is just a smuggling rap?

00:51:27,645 --> 00:51:29,670
- The package that boy is carrying--
- It's a girl.

745
00:51:29,747 --> 00:51:34,047
She's cute too. Except I don't think
she's all there, you know.

746
00:51:34,118 --> 00:51:36,143
Course, not all of her has to be.

747
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,085
That girl is a precious commodity.

They'll come after her. Long after
you bury me, they'll be coming.

Well, don't they teach you
how to withstand interrogation?

Okay. I can see you're not an idiot.

But if you help me out...

768

Better one than this piece of crap.

turning on the captain?

00:52:55,399 --> 00:52:57,390
Yes, it does.

772
00:52:59,637 --> 00:53:02,765

You said we could get around them.
- It's not Alliance.

- Nah, it's a smaller vessel.

- Commercial?
- Uh,yeah.

- They don't.

- Get me a visual.
- They're still too far out.

probably a raiding party.

Could be they're headed
somewhere particular.

Companion immunization package.
- Thank you.

- It won't hurt.

I don't know how to--

00:59:28,163 --> 00:59:30,097
You're lost in the woods.

850
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:32,861
We all are. Even the captain.

851
00:59:32,934 --> 00:59:35,232
The only difference is
he likes it that way.

852
00:59:35,303 --> 00:59:40,331
No, the only difference is the woods
are the only place I can see a clear path.

- What's your business here?
- It's my business.

854
00:59:43,812 --> 00:59:46,144
The usual. I gave the boy...

855

a free thrust since
he's not long for this world.

What are you doing in my shuttle?

857
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,019
It's my shuttle. You rent it.

858
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:55,852
Then when I'm behind on the rent,
you can enter unasked.

00:59:56,992 --> 00:59:58,926
I thought you were leaving anyhow.

gonna have to deal with him.

But I don't think you got the guts.

- Yeah.

01:01:56,745 --> 01:01:59,373
To tell the truth,
I didn't expect her to heal this quick.

- Hello, Patience.

to be hearin' from you anytime soon.

'Cause your asking price is a bit
too reasonable for that much treasure.
