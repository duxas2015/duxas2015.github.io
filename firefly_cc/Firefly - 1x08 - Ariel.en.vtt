00:24:12.489 --> 00:24:15.890
short range, won't go far.

00:24:15.959 --> 00:24:18.792
But each got heat,
and they each got air.

00:24:18.862 --> 00:24:21.353
Last longer than
what's left on Serenity.

00:24:21.431 --> 00:24:25.595
- Long enough to reach someplace?
- No.

00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:28.763
So, where will we go then?

00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:30.773
Far as you can get.

00:24:30.841 --> 00:24:33.366
We send both shuttles off
in opposite directions--

00:24:33.443 --> 00:24:35.377
betters the chances of someone
getting seen, maybe picked up.

00:24:35.445 --> 00:24:37.811
Shepherd Book, Kaylee, Jayne...

00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:41.442
you'll ride with Inara in her shuttle.

00:24:41.518 --> 00:24:44.487
Doc, you and your sis will ride
with Wash and Zoe, seeing as how...

00:24:44.554 --> 00:24:46.647
Zoe still needs some doctorin'.

00:24:46.723 --> 00:24:52.684
- What about you?
- Four people per shuttle.
That's the arrangement.

00:24:52.762 --> 00:24:55.458
Evens the odds.
I'm staying with Serenity.

00:24:55.532 --> 00:24:58.296
- Captain--
- We sent out a beacon.

00:24:58.368 --> 00:25:00.495
Even managed to boost it a little.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:04.233
If by some chance we get a response,
someone's gonna have to be here to answer.

00:25:08.478 --> 00:25:10.673
Let's get those shuttles prepped.

00:25:12.315 --> 00:25:16.217
Wash, shuttles are that way.

00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:20.484
I know. But like you said,
someone might answer the beacon.

00:25:20.557 --> 00:25:23.219
And when they do, I want to make
sure that you can call everyone back.

00:25:23.293 --> 00:25:25.488
Won't take but a minute.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.996
Jayne,you get shuttle number two ready.
I'll see to Inara's.

00:25:31.134 --> 00:25:34.661
Friends, get movin'.
Take only what you need.

00:25:38.675 --> 00:25:41.109
- Mal.
- If you fly smart, don't push too hard...

00:25:41.177 --> 00:25:43.372
shuttle life support
should last you a good long while.

00:25:43.446 --> 00:25:46.347
Mal, this isn't the ancient sea. You
don't have to go down with your ship!

00:25:46.416 --> 00:25:48.384
She ain't goin' down.
She ain't goin' anywhere.

00:25:48.451 --> 00:25:50.442
Jayne'll be worth something
if you run into trouble...

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.080
but don't trust him
and don't let him take over.

00:25:53.156 --> 00:25:55.454
You're paid up through the end
of the month. It's still your ship.

00:25:55.525 --> 00:25:58.551
- Mal.
- And as far as your security deposit goes...

00:25:58.628 --> 00:26:01.096
that I might have to owe you.

00:26:02.165 --> 00:26:05.362
Well, here she is.

00:26:08.939 --> 00:26:11.635
- Nice, ain't she?
- Smallish.

00:26:11.708 --> 00:26:13.869
Well, not overly.

00:26:13.944 --> 00:26:17.141
How much room do you really need
for what you do anyway?

00:26:17.213 --> 00:26:20.410
I got a surveyor and his wife
interested in renting it.

00:26:20.483 --> 00:26:22.576
They're just waiting to hear back.

00:26:22.652 --> 00:26:25.712
- What's her range?
- Standard short.

00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:28.121
She'll break atmo
from a wide orbit...

00:26:28.191 --> 00:26:32.150
get you where you need to go,
bring you back home again.

00:26:32.228 --> 00:26:35.561
She's space-worthy,
just like the rest of Serenity is.

00:26:35.632 --> 00:26:39.193
No need to sound
so defensive, Captain.

00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:42.796
I prefer something
with a few miles on it.

00:26:42.872 --> 00:26:45.932
Were we to enter into this
arrangement, Captain Reynolds...

00:26:46.009 --> 00:26:51.914
there are a few things I would require from
you-- the foremost being complete autonomy.

00:26:51.982 --> 00:26:55.748
The shuttle would be my home.
No crew member, including yourself...

00:26:55.819 --> 00:26:59.186
- would be allowed entrance
without my express invitation.
- You'd get your privacy.

00:26:59.255 --> 00:27:03.214
Andjust so we're clear, under no
circumstances will I be servicing you...

00:27:03.293 --> 00:27:05.261
or anyone who is
under your employ.

00:27:05.328 --> 00:27:09.230
- I'll post a sign.
- That won't be necessary.

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:12.427
The other thing I would insist upon
is some measure of assurance...

00:27:12.502 --> 00:27:14.493
that when I make
an appointment with a client...

00:27:14.571 --> 00:27:17.369
I'm in a position
to keep that appointment.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.103
So far as such assurances
are possible on a vessel of this type.

00:27:21.177 --> 00:27:23.771
That's an awful lot
of caveats and addendums there, miss.

00:27:23.847 --> 00:27:26.372
As I stated,
I just want to be clear.

00:27:26.449 --> 00:27:29.941
Well, I'll be sure to take all that into
consideration while I review the applications.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.989
Don't be ridiculous.
You're gonna rent this shuttle to me.

00:27:33.056 --> 00:27:35.286
- Am I?
- Yes.

00:27:35.358 --> 00:27:38.020
And for one quarter less
than your asking price.

00:27:38.094 --> 00:27:41.188
- Is that a fact?
- It is.

00:27:41.264 --> 00:27:44.427
And you figure
you'll be getting this discount...

00:27:44.501 --> 00:27:47.834
- why, exactly?
- You want me.

00:27:48.905 --> 00:27:51.135
You want me on your ship.

00:27:51.207 --> 00:27:53.801
- Do I?
- Yes.

00:27:53.877 --> 00:27:56.141
Because I can bring
something that your surveyor...

00:27:56.212 --> 00:27:59.477
or any of the other fish
you might have on-line can't--

00:27:59.549 --> 00:28:02.040
- a certain respectability.
- Respecta--

00:28:02.118 --> 00:28:05.849
And based on what little
I've seen of your operation...

00:28:05.922 --> 00:28:08.914
I suspect that's
something you could use.

00:28:11.394 --> 00:28:15.057
Fine.
Let me ask you this.

00:28:15.131 --> 00:28:19.363
If you're so respectable,
why are you even here?

00:28:19.436 --> 00:28:22.837
I mean, I've heard tell of
fancy ladies such as yourself...

00:28:22.906 --> 00:28:25.500
shipping out with
big luxury liners and the like, but...

00:28:25.575 --> 00:28:28.840

on a boat like this?

00:28:28.912 --> 00:28:32.006

- I'm not running from anything.

00:28:32.082 --> 00:28:35.313
If it's Alliance trouble you got,
you might want to consider another ship.

for the independents.

00:28:37.454 --> 00:28:39.922

no quarrel with me.

00:28:39.989 --> 00:28:44.756
- I supported unification.
- Did ya?

00:28:44.828 --> 00:28:47.456
Well, I don't suppose
you're the only whore that did.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:50.761
Oh, one further addendum.

00:28:50.834 --> 00:28:53.564
That's the last time
you get to call me ''whore.''

00:28:54.938 --> 00:28:58.237
Absolutely.
Never again.

00:28:58.308 --> 00:29:01.607

00:29:01.678 --> 00:29:04.670

00:29:18.862 --> 00:29:21.092
Come with us.

00:29:21.164 --> 00:29:23.894
Can't.
Four to a shuttle, Inara.

00:29:23.967 --> 00:29:26.663
- Four.
- One more, you know
it can't make a difference.

00:29:26.736 --> 00:29:29.796
- Not now.
- I'm not leaving Serenity.

00:29:29.873 --> 00:29:32.967
Mal, you don't
have to die alone.

00:29:35.078 --> 00:29:37.569
Everybody dies alone.

- Everything's set and ready.
- Good.

00:29:46.289 --> 00:29:50.749
I linked the nav systems
of both shuttles into the helm here.

this button once. It'll call back both shuttles.

diverted what's left to the bridge.

00:30:18.955 --> 00:30:23.915
Ain't much. My advice is seal off everything
tight behind you on your way back up.

00:30:23.994 --> 00:30:25.985
Might buy you some time.

00:30:26.062 --> 00:30:29.896
And I prepped a suit for you.
It's hanging in the foredeck.

00:30:29.966 --> 00:30:33.265

- I won't be needing it, but thanks.

- Right. Your mechanical trouble.

- It was the catalyzer.

00:37:24.814 --> 00:37:26.975
That's all he needs.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.417
You know, anything that's worth anything
is really right here in this cargo bay.

00:37:30.486 --> 00:37:33.853
So you take a look around,
decide what you think is fair.

00:37:33.923 --> 00:37:36.255
Already decided.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:44.196

- [ Pistol Cocking ]
- We'll get it as far as--

00:37:54.944 --> 00:37:58.710
Jesse, don't call Stern.

00:37:58.781 --> 00:38:02.273
Billy, leave the catalyzer.

00:38:06.255 --> 00:38:08.189
Do as he says.

00:38:08.257 --> 00:38:10.919
[ Shuddering ]

00:38:10.993 --> 00:38:13.291
Take your people and go.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.739
You would've done the same.

00:38:32.815 --> 00:38:35.443
We can already see I haven't.

00:38:35.518 --> 00:38:37.850
Now get the hell off my ship.

-pound this button once--
it'll call back both shuttles.
- Everybody dies alone.

00:40:43.779 --> 00:40:46.907
- [ Wash ] I'll run up and scrape up a piece.
- [ Zoe ] You'd do that for me?

Oh,you're a pretty baby.

00:40:56.092 --> 00:40:58.458
[ Inara ] I think it's something
he should see when he wakes up.

00:40:58.528 --> 00:41:03.192
- [Jayne ] He's seen blood before, lots of it.
- Welcome back, sir.

- Yeah, Mal, I'm fine.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.483
- You got a thing in your arm.
- Yeah!

00:41:23.553 --> 00:41:26.351
Try not to speak. You're heavily medicated,
and you lost a lot of blood.

00:41:26.422 --> 00:41:28.754
[ Groans ]

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.393
I thought I ordered
you all off the ship?

- I call you back?
- No, Mal, you didn't.

00:41:38.834 --> 00:41:42.565
I take full responsibility, Captain.

00:41:42.638 --> 00:41:44.572

It was my pleasure, sir.

Hey, we'd have been back first, except there's
somethin' wrong with Inara's shuttle.

She done somethin'to it, Mal.
It smells funny.

I have to insist--
the captain needs to rest.

Yeah. I think the doc might
not be wrong about that one.
