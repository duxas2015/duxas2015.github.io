00:39:58.608 --> 00:40:00.701
Man's lookin'
to kill some folk.

00:40:00.777 --> 00:40:05.373
So really it's his will y'all
should worry about thwarting.

00:40:05.448 --> 00:40:10.818
Gotta say, Doctor,
[ Inaudible ] it's near miraculous.

00:40:10.887 --> 00:40:13.754
Yes, I'm very proud.

00:40:13.823 --> 00:40:17.259
- Cut her down.
- The girl is a witch.

00:40:17.326 --> 00:40:22.730
Yeah, but she's our witch,
so cut her the hell down.

00:40:30.406 --> 00:40:35.207
Hey, Doctor. Glad you're
back now on the ship.

00:40:35.278 --> 00:40:37.212
Thanks.

00:40:45.488 --> 00:40:47.615
I've moved him to his room.

00:40:48.991 --> 00:40:50.925
How's he faring?

00:40:50.993 --> 00:40:53.894
He's gonna be fine. Yeah.
They took good care of him.

00:40:53.963 --> 00:40:56.557
Good to know.

00:40:56.632 --> 00:40:59.726
So finally a decent wound
on this ship, and I miss out.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:02.532
I'm sorry.

00:41:02.605 --> 00:41:05.096
You were busy trying to get
yourself lit on fire.

00:41:05.174 --> 00:41:07.108
It happens.

00:41:07.176 --> 00:41:09.940
Captain?

00:41:10.012 --> 00:41:13.209
- Why did you come back for us?
- You're on my crew.

00:41:13.282 --> 00:41:17.582
Yeah, but you don't even like me.
Why'd you come back?

00:41:17.653 --> 00:41:21.851
You're on my crew. Why are we
still talking about this?

00:41:21.924 --> 00:41:25.792
Chow's in ten.
No need to dress.

00:41:36.339 --> 00:41:39.934
[ Mal ] The shepherd says--
[ Continues, Indistinct ]

00:41:40.009 --> 00:41:42.842
[ Laughter ]

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.324
Great.

00:42:38.134 --> 00:42:41.069
Grr! Arrgh!

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
