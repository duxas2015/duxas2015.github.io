1
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:16,234
I don't want it.

2
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,241
River, you have to eat.

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,244
It's good.
It tastes like--

4
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,940
- It's good.
- It smells like crotch.

5
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:27,006
- Jayne!
- Well, it does.

6
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:29,678
We don't even have to go
someplace fancy.

7
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:32,188
We can just go
to the park or something.

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,952
- Feed the pigeons.
- Sure. Feed the pigeons...

9
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:37,789
probably get the firing squad
for littering.

10
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:39,921
Come on.
It's not that bad.

11
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:43,057
It is. It's a core planet.
It's spotless. It's got sensors.

12
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:45,068
And where there ain't sensors,
there's feds.

13
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:48,401
All central planets
are the same.

14
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:51,305
Could you please tell my wife
the fun she's missing out on?

15
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:54,003
Ariel's quite a nice place,
actually.

16
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:56,205
There are some beautiful
museums, not to mention...

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,214
some of the finest restaurants
in the core.

18
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:01,217
But... not boring,
like she made it sound.

19
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:03,879
There's a, uh...

20
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:05,478
uh--

21
00:01:05,556 --> 00:01:08,320
- There's hiking.
- [ Wash ] Yeah.

22
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:11,555
And you can go swimming in
a bioluminescent lake.

23
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,928
I don't care if it's got sunsets 24 hours a day.
I ain't setting foot on that planet.

24
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:17,331
No one is setting foot
on that fancy rock.

25
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:19,369
I don't want anyone
leaving the ship.

26
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:21,997
Come to think of it, I don't want anyone
looking out the windows...

27
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:24,006
or talking aloud.

28
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:26,008
We're here to drop off Inara.
That's it.

29
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:29,307
What's the point of coming to the core
if I can't even step off the boat?

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,474
You could have got off with
Shepherd Book at the Bathgate Abbey.

31
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,577
Could've been meditating on the wonders
of your rock garden by now.

32
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:39,350
Well, it beats
just sitting.

33
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:42,051
It is just sitting.

34
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:44,060
[ Zoe ] So how long are you
gonna be planet-side?

35
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:46,062
[ Inara ]
Shouldn't be more than a day or two.

36

[ Wash ] Big stop just to renew
your license to Companion.

37
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:53,035
- Can I use "Companion" as a verb?
- It's guild law.

38
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:56,038
All Companions are required to undergo
a physical examination once a year.

00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:04,371
Could you not do that
while we're-- ever?

41
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,520
[ Wash ]
So two days in a hospital. That's awful.

42
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,352
- Don't you just hate doctors?
- Hey.

[ Wash ]
I mean, present company excluded.

44
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:19,793
Let's not be excluding people.
That'd be rude.

- [ Groaning ] Son of a--
- [ Simon ] What the hell?

46

- River, no.
- Oh, my God. He's bleeding.

47
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:31,236
- That's deep.
- Are you okay?
- River.

[ Groans, Breathing Heavily ]

49
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,101
He looks better in red.

[ Inhaling Sharply ]

52
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:46,188
Gorram freak's
completely off her axle.

53
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:50,091
- I'm sorry about this. I don't know what--
- Shut it. I ain't talking to you.

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,185
She gotta go.
Both of them gotta go.

55
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:54,197
Ariel's as good a place as any
to leave them.

56
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:58,065
- Might even pick us up a reward
for our troubles.
- No one's getting left.

57
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,069
She belongs in a bughouse.

58
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:03,163
You don't pitch her off this boat
right now, I swear to you--

59
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,333
What?
What do you swear,Jayne?

60
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:09,937
They don't get gone, you better
start locking up your room at night.

61
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:12,312
Next time little sister
gets in a murdering mood...

62
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:14,613
it might be you
she comes calling on.

63
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:17,449
Maybe Kaylee or Inara.

64
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:20,786
You let them stay,
we're gonna find out.

65
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,425
Finish your work, Doctor.

66
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,727
This is my boat.
They're part of my crew.

67
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,166
No one's getting left.
Best you get used to that.

68
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:37,864
You owe me a shirt.

69
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:43,169
She's to stay confined to her room
at all times. No exceptions.

70
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:45,715
Take her to the kitchen,
the infirmary, whatever...

71
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:48,377
- you ask me first, understand?
- I do.

72
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:51,819
When I took you and your sister in,
the deal was you keep her in check.

73
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:55,450
You can't hold up your end,
we're gonna have to revisit the deal.

She's getting worse.
Isn't she?

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,998
Yes.

76
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:22,118
Just look at the bright side.

77
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:25,417
Maybe you'll meet a young,
handsome doctor.

78
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:27,650
He'll ask you out, and--

00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,091
What's the Companion policy
on dating?

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,822
- It's complicated.
- Hmm.

00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:35,831
- Well, that figures.
- Stay out of trouble.

00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,333
You too. Bye.

[Jayne Grunts ]

00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,201
How are we gonna find a job
if we don't leave the ship?

85
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:48,733
Alliance territory--
ain't any jobs worth having.

86
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:52,009
Or the last three places
we've been.

87
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:56,542
My pop always said,
"Anyone who can't find work
ain't lookin' hard enough."

88
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,351
- We ain't even lookin' at all.
- [ Simon ] You can stop looking.

89
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:04,053
There's a client. Me.

90
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,360
I have a job for you.

91
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,630
~ Take my love, take my land ~

92
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:16,161
~ Take me where I cannot stand ~

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,936
~ I don't care, I'm still free ~

~ You can't take the sky from me ~

~ Take me out to the black ~

~ Tell them I ain't comin'back ~

~ Burn the land and boil the sea ~

00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:36,417
~ You can't take the sky from me ~

[ Wash ]
Forget it. We ain't that desperate.

104
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:12,754
Do you know what this is? It's a common
immune booster called isoprobyline.

105
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,094
Street value
for a dosage this size--

106
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:18,464
50 platinum,
maybe 20 credits.

107
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:20,833
Propoxyn. Maybe 80.

108
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:24,269
Hydrozopan, 200.

109
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:29,443
And these are just from the med kit
I had with me when I came on board.

110
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:32,414
At a hospital like the one
in Ariel City...

111
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:34,542
they'll have shelves
of that stuff.

112
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:38,281
Whatever the take, it's more than enough
payment for what I have in mind.

113
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:41,017
So the med vault
isn't the job?

114
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:43,082
[ Simon ]
That's the payment.

115
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,187
I tell you how to get in, get out,
and what's worth taking...

116
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:50,131
if you help me get River into
the hospital's diagnostic ward.

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,896
- [ Mal ] What's in the diagnostic ward?
- A 3-D neuro-imager.

118
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,373
If I can get River in there, I might be able to
figure out what they did to her at the academy.

119
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,602
So we get you and your sister
into the "whatcha" thing...

120
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:02,042
and you tell us how to clean out
the hospital.

121
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:04,580
- Yes.
- Not to be negative...

122
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:06,878
but don't the hospital
need that medicine?

123
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,884
Government-run facility.

124
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:10,886
They'd be restocked
in a matter of hours.

125
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:12,888
She's right.
They'll never miss it.

126
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:15,254
Plus folks on the rim
sure could use it.

127
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:19,022
It's all very sweet stealing from
the rich, selling to the poor.

128
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:22,497
But you're talking about breaking into
a highly secure Alliance facility.

129
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:25,865
- How do plan on getting around security?
- It's not easy...

130
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:28,461
but it can be done.

131
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,642
You see,
like all core hospitals...

132
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,077
St. Lucy's has its own
dedicated security force--

133
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:42,016
a small battery of local
Alliance federals substationed here.

134
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:46,044
- Every floor, every doorway
is equipped with sensors.
- [ Beeping ]

135
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:50,025
And at all points of entry,
patient eye-dent scans.

136
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:52,118
However, once clear
of those checkpoints...

137
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:55,893
movement within the facility itself
should be relatively unhindered.

138
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:59,561
- The standard layout
should put the med vaults--
- Go back to the eye-dent scans.

139
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:01,570
You and your sister
are tagged fugitives.

140
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:04,471
- How do you figure we're
gonna get you in the building?
- Through the front door.

141
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:09,103
Believe me, Captain, getting
the two of us in is going to be easy.

142
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:12,979
The rest of you--
that is going to be the real trick.

143
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,545
We'll need to procure
a few items off-ship. I've made a list.

144
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:22,888
Given my status as a fugitive,
someone else will have to--

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,986
We have some volunteers. Good.

146
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:29,829
Before we ever make it to the front door, we're
going to have to breach the perimeter.

147
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,564
Only official vehicles are allowed in,
so we'll need one.

148
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:37,630
Now obviously we can't steal
what we need.

149
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,642
Any illegal activity
in the planning stages...

150
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,644
could end this thing
before it starts.

151
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:44,647
St. Lucy's Hospital contracts
with the local municipal dump yard...

152
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:47,206
for all its large disposals.

153
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:53,051
It figures. First time on the core,
and what do I get to do?

154
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:58,117
Dig through trash. Couldn't he
send me shopping at the Triplex or--

155
00:08:58,195 --> 00:09:01,528
Ooh! Synchronizers!

156

[ Simon ]
Big hospitals mean big waste...

157
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,728

finding what we're looking for.

159
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:18,139
We'll have to look
like we belong.

[ Beeps ]

161
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:35,493
All we have to do is slip
a couple ofbills into the right hands.

162
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,966
That gets us uniforms,
I.D. badges and key cards.

163
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,699
A little creative forgery,
and we've got ourselves a working alias.

164
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,873
Now, all these items

- Oh, nothing much.

491
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:58,484
Lots of running around, a little gunplay.
A couple needles.

492
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:01,547
The next time we come to the core,
I'm staying with the preacher.

493
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:03,855
If you hadn't come,
you wouldn't be getting your big payday.

494
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:07,954
So, you get
what you needed?

495
00:37:08,031 --> 00:37:10,864
I think I did. I have the information
I downloaded off the imager.

496
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:15,132
I just have to go over it,
and, uh, I'm hopeful.

497
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,969
- What happened to your face?
- Huh?

498
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:20,976
- Oh, uh, nothing.
- [ Simon ] He was amazing.

499
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:23,706
I can't even begin
to tell you.

500
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,975
We wouldn't be standing here
if it weren't for him.

501
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:30,713
- Thank you.
- Hey, you're part of my crew.

502
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:34,881
I think I might cry.

503
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:38,325
All right. Jayne, help me with the
cargo. Everyone make yourselves useful.

504
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:40,329
You got jobs.
Go do them.

505
00:37:42,165 --> 00:37:44,725
It's gotta be
our best take ever.

506
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:47,964
Doc had a good notion.
The boy's got a decent criminal mind.

507
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:53,069
What are you buying
with your cut?

508
00:38:14,864 --> 00:38:17,628
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

509
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:30,938
The job is done.
I figured it was time for a little chat.

510
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:34,211
[ Beeping ]

511
00:38:35,552 --> 00:38:37,543
[ Door Opening ]

512
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:42,625
[ Grunting ]

513
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:46,385
[ Mal On Radio ]
Seems to me we had a solid plan.

514
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:49,227
"Scruth," you might say.

515
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:53,395
But what I can't figure out is what you
were doing around the back exit.

516
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:57,167
What? I couldn't
go out the front!

517
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,266
I had to improvise!
Open the damn door!

518
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:02,277
You called the feds.

519
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:04,540
What? I got pinched!

520
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:07,174
Which is what happens
when you call the feds.

521
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,583
No, I would never do that!
My hand to God!

522
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:12,883
May he strike me down
as I'm standing here!

523
00:39:12,956 --> 00:39:14,924
Well, you won't be
standing there long.

524
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:19,018
The minute we break out, you'll be a lot
thinner once you get sucked out that hole.

525
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:22,360
- Oh, come on, Mal!
- [ Computer Voice ]
Leaving atmo in two minutes.

526
00:39:22,432 --> 00:39:25,424
- That ain't no way for a man to die!
- Secure air lock door at once.

527
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:26,799
[ Alarm Blaring ]

528
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,431
You wanna kill me, shoot me!
Just let me in!

529
00:39:30,507 --> 00:39:33,533
You know, I hear tell they used to
keelhaul traitors back in the day.

530
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,771
I don't have a keel
to haul you on, so--

531
00:39:35,845 --> 00:39:40,748
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry, all right?

532
00:39:40,817 --> 00:39:45,083
Sorry for what, Jayne?
I thought you'd never do such a thing.

533
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:50,856
Money was too good.
I got stupid.

534
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:52,952
I'm sorry, okay?

535
00:39:53,029 --> 00:39:54,929
Be reasonable.

536
00:39:54,998 --> 00:39:57,432
What are you taking it
so personal for?

537
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,730
It ain't like I ratted you out
to the feds.

538
00:39:59,803 --> 00:40:04,866
But you did! You turn on
any of my crew, you turn on me!

539
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:07,967
If it's such a concept you can't seem
to wrap your head around...

540
00:40:08,044 --> 00:40:10,979
then you got no place here.

541
00:40:11,047 --> 00:40:15,108
You did it to me, Jayne.
And that's a fact.

542
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:26,393
What are you gonna
tell the others?

543
00:40:26,463 --> 00:40:29,955
- About what?
- About why I'm dead.

544
00:40:31,701 --> 00:40:33,726
I hadn't thought about it.

545
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:37,537
Make something up.

546
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:40,405
Don't tell them what I did.

[ Sighing ]

548
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:54,921
The next time you decide
to stab me in the back...

549
00:40:54,991 --> 00:40:58,654
have the guts
to do it to my face.

550
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:13,166
Can I come in?

551
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,974
Hi.

552
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:24,279
What are you doing?

553
00:41:24,354 --> 00:41:27,380
Drawing.

554
00:41:27,457 --> 00:41:29,391
That's really good.

555
00:41:33,096 --> 00:41:35,428
What are you doing?

556
00:41:35,498 --> 00:41:38,695
I, um--
I brought some medicine.

557
00:41:40,303 --> 00:41:43,170
Do you remember why
we went to the hospital?

558
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:46,037
Is it time to
go to sleep again?

559
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,601
No, mei-mei.

560
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:56,878
It's time to wake up.

561
00:42:42,265 --> 00:42:45,257
Grr! Arrgh!
