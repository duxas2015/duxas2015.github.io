169
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:25,809
I'll cook you something.

170
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,007
Well, no. I meant for you.

171
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:30,050
I'm a fine cook. Everyone says.

172
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:32,245
That's-- It's great.
Look, hold it. Hold.

173
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:36,114
- I ain't never even--
- My name is Saffron.

174
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:53,070
Divorce is very rare and requires
dispensation from her pastor.

175
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:56,907
I can send him a wave,
see what I can do.

176
00:11:56,978 --> 00:11:59,139
I appreciate that.
She's a nice girl.

177
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:01,977
- Seems very anxious to please you.
- It's their way, I guess.

178
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,041
I suppose so.

179
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:08,015
If you take
sexual advantage of her...

180
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:10,717
you're going to burn
in a very special level of hell...

181
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:13,454
a level they reserve
for child molesters...

182
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:15,962
and people who talk
at the theater.

183
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,625
Wh-- I am not--

184
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:23,029
Preacher,
you got a smutty mind.

185
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:25,629
- Perhaps I spoke out of turn.
- Per-maybe-haps, I'm thinkin'.

186
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:28,870
I apologize. I'll make her up a room
in the passenger dorm.

187
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:31,138
Good.

188
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,712
The special hell.

189
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:42,579
Thank you.

190
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:44,648
Looks--

191
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:47,727
[ Wash ]
Something smells good.

192
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:51,231
Having yourself
a little supper, Captain?

193
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:55,030
Saffron insisted on it. You know,
I didn't want to make her feel--

194
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:57,037
[ Chuckling ]
This is damn tasty.

195
00:12:57,105 --> 00:12:59,903
Is there any more
where that came from?

196
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:02,875
I didn't think to make enough
for your friends...

197
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:06,903
but everything's laid out if you'd
like to cook for your husband.

198
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:09,779
Yeah. Isn't she quaint?

199
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:11,944
I'm just not hungry.

200
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,548
So... are you enjoying your own
nubile little slave girl?

201
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:19,855
She wanted to make me dinner.
At least she's not crying.

202
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:22,725
I might.
Did she really make fresh bao?

203
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:24,890
Quaint!

204
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:29,130
- Remember that sex we were
planning to have ever again?
- You're all making a big deal.

205
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:32,934
I would appreciate it if one person
on this boat would not assume...

206
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:34,941
that I'm an evil, lecherous hump.

207
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:36,943
Nobody's saying that, sir.

208
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:39,912
We're pretty much just giving
each other significant glances...

209
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:41,915
and laughing incessantly.

210
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:44,781
- Is that cider?
- By the stove.

211
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:47,844
Yum.
I'll get you a refill. Honey?

212
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:50,482
That's for me to do.

213
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:57,896
You know, uh, you weren't lyin'
about your cookin'.

214
00:13:57,965 --> 00:14:01,059
If I hadn't already eaten--

215
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:05,595
- You don't want to finish?
- No, I just, um--

216
00:14:05,673 --> 00:14:08,767
I have captainy things to do,
but truthfully, that's a fine meal.

217
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:10,777
- Thank you.
- Do you need anything else?

218
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:12,779
No. No.

219
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:16,647
Um, you just have something
to eat yourself, and, uh...

220
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:19,311
and I'm gonna go... captain.

221

If you're done with supper...

222
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:22,317
If you're done with supper...

223
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:25,618
would you like me
to wash your feet?

224
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,600
Beaumond.

225
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,574
- City of New Dunsmuir.
- [ Beeping ]

226
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:46,702
Arrival: October 2 4.

227
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:49,144
- Departure--
- Can I come in?

228
00:14:49,214 --> 00:14:52,411
- No.
- See? That's why I usually don't ask.

229
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:54,543
What do you want?

230
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:58,419
Oh, I just needed to... hide.

231
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,721
- So I take it the honeymoon is over?
- Oh, she's a fine girl.

232
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:03,852
Don't misread me.
A hell of a cook too.

233
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:06,397
I'm sure she has
many exciting talents.

234
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,598
Do you ever...

235
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:13,570
wash your clients' feet?

236
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:16,368
It's my specialty.

237
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:19,933
- We'll be on Beaumond
at least two weeks, right?
- Can't exactly be sure.

238
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:23,208
I need you to be exactly sure. I can't make
commitments and then not keep them.

239
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,215
That's your specialty.

240
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:30,747
Sorry. Are you touchy because I got myself
a bride or 'cause I don't plan to keep her?

241
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:32,517
I find the whole thing degrading.

242
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:35,924
That's just what Saffron said
about your line of work.

243
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:40,522
Maybe you should think twice about letting go
of Saffron. You two sound like a match.

244
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:43,932
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we're soul mates.

245
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:46,869
Yes. Great. I wish you
hundreds of fat children.

246
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:50,396
Could you imagine that? Me with
a whole passel of critters underfoot.

247
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:54,536
- Hell, in ten years' time--
- Can you leave me alone
for five minutes, please?

248
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:08,219
I wasn't lookin' for a fight.

249
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,991
Always do seem
to find one, though.

250
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,472
Do I have your attention?

251
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:27,937
Kind of going to extremes here,
ain't we?

252
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:32,416
There's times I think you don't take me
seriously. I think that oughta change.

253
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:35,282
Do you think it's likely to?

254
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:37,321
You got something
you don't deserve.

255
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:40,483
And it's brought me a galaxy of fun,
I'm here to tell ya.

256
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:45,819
Six men came to kill me one time...

257
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:47,990
and the best of them carried this.

258
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:50,933
It's a Callahan full-bore auto lock.

259
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:54,631

Double cartridge thorough gauge.

260
00:16:57,442 --> 00:17:00,536
It is my very favorite gun.

[ Speaking Chinese ]
Are you offering me a trade?

262
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:10,119
A trade? Hell, it's theft.

263
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:13,180
This is the best damn gun made by man.
It has extreme sentimental value.

264
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:17,160
- It's miles more worthy than what you got.
- What I got?

265
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:19,662
- She has a name.
- So does this.

266
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:21,665
I call it Vera.

267
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:26,397
My days of not taking you seriously
are certainly comin' to a middle.

268
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:29,804
- Damn it, Mal. I'd treat her okay.
- She's not to be bought.

Nor bartered, or borrowed, or lent.

270
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:36,370
She's a human woman, doesn't know a thing
about the world and needs our protection.

- Well, I'll protect her.
-Jayne.

You're a good man.

00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:02,602
You clearly haven't been talkin'
to anyone else on this boat.

to the large one.

If I'm not to be yours...

I'd rather have the work
you spoke of.

280
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:14,611
I could be useful in a ranch.

00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:17,018
It's good work.

282

My mama had a ranch back on Shadow,
where I'm from.

Ran cattle, mostly.

284

Wasn't nobody ran 'em
harder or smarter.

285

What's your history?

Oh, I long for a little dullness.

- [ Beeping ]

A lot of cheap parts

This is why you'll never
be in charge, Bree.

- You don't see the whole. The parts are crap.
- I said exactly that.

She comes our way,

00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,685
Clearly, she's out of her mind.

313

Really? She's led a sheltered life.

314
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,656
Did you see the way
she grabbed that glass from you?

Every planet has
its own weird customs.

316
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:15,368
About a year before we met,
I spent six weeks on a moon...

317
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,376
where the principle form
of recreation was juggling geese.

318
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:22,880
My hand to God. Baby geese.
Goslings. They were juggled.

319
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,882
Of course.
The man rushes in to defend her.

320

I'm talking about geese.

321
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:33,051
Captain shouldn't be baby-sitting
a damn groupie, and he knows it.

322
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:35,149
Okay, when did this
become not funny?

323
00:20:35,226 --> 00:20:37,694
When you didn't put her ass
back down on Triumph.

324
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:40,196
Oh, hey!
Now it's even my fault?

325
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:43,598
Is there anything else on your mind
I should know about?

326
00:20:43,668 --> 00:20:46,660
- There's all sorts of twists
and cul-de-sacs. It's wild.
- She's trouble.

- Besides molesting innocent captains?

You want to stow it, Preacher?
We're in some peril here.

- If she can fly this thing,
why just take the shuttle?
- Maybe she likes shuttles.

- Yeah-huh.

- Yeah, yeah! We are so hung.

I'm glad you two are having
a good time under there.

for a long while, Captain.
- We don't have a long while.

that got us into this, sir.

and navcon back on-line,

-That pattern you're looking at is a net.

We fall into that,
we're more than helpless.

It'll turn the ship into one big electrical
conduit, burn us all from the inside out.

Some of the newer ones
will just hold you...
