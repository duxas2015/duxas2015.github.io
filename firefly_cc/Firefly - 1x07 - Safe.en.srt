Come on, admit it.
It's true.

00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,194
No, I won't, because it's not.

3
00:00:06,268 --> 00:00:10,170
- I use swear words, like anybody else.
- Oh, really?

4
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:13,436
See, I've never heard you.
So when is it that you do all this cussing?

5
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:15,908
- After I go to bed, or--
- I swear...

6
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:18,276
when it's appropriate.

7
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:22,408
Simon, the whole point of swearing
is that it ain't appropriate.

8
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:25,476
Hey, there, Inara.

glamorous romance?

too much trouble while I'm gone.

- What?
- [ Clattering ]

14
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:54,012
- Oh!
- Now, this would be a perfect
time for a swear word.

15
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:56,744
What... happened in here?

16
00:00:56,818 --> 00:01:00,310
- Needed to find some tape.
- So you had to tear my infirmary apart?

17
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:02,721
Apparently.

18
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,692
My God. You're like a trained ape.

19
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,991
Without the training.

21
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:12,626
I told you we're setting down on the Canton
factory settlement on Higgins's Moon.

22
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,726
Yep. That you did.

23
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:16,794
Canton don't allow
guns in their town.

24
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:20,399
Yes, sir. That's why I ain't
strappin' one to my hip.

25
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:23,035
No. That's why you ain't
strapping one anywhere.

26
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:25,671
Oh, listen, Mal,
I was in Canton a few years back.

27
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:28,614
I might have made me
a few enemies thereabouts.

28
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:31,152
Enemies? You?

29
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,449
No! How can it be?

30
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:35,820
Just don't like the idea of goin' in there
empty-handed, is all.

31
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:38,655
Why are you still arguing
what's been decided?

32
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,007
Okay, Inara. We're atmospheric.
You are good to go.

33
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,013
Thanks, Wash.

36
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,810
Canton really stinks.

37
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:32,438
That's what makes it such a great drop point.
No one comes here that doesn't have to.

38
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:35,074
I vote we do this job
really, really fast.

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,551

He's holding the goods we're to deliver.

Easy-peasy.

Call ahead to Bernoulli, let him know he'll
have his merchandise end of the week.

- I outrank you.

where they--

they make mud.

Yep. Clay, really. You'd be surprised
how many things it ends up in.

- Captain, don't you think
Simon should come with us?

don't think it's a good--

developing a rapport.

- I-I don't know. River--
- Go on.

I'm a shepherd after all. I should be able
to keep my eye on a flock of one.

00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:36,571
We're not going that far, Doctor,
and you might maybe make yourself useful.

Come again?

to sightseers, which is why we're...

more than the good doctor.
