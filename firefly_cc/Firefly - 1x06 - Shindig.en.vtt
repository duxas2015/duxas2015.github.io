00:12:42.657 --> 00:12:44.648
Looks--

00:12:45.793 --> 00:12:47.727
[ Wash ]
Something smells good.

00:12:47.795 --> 00:12:51.231
Having yourself
a little supper, Captain?

00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:55.030
Saffron insisted on it. You know,
I didn't want to make her feel--

00:12:55.103 --> 00:12:57.037
[ Chuckling ]
This is damn tasty.

00:12:57.105 --> 00:12:59.903
Is there any more
where that came from?

00:12:59.974 --> 00:13:02.875
I didn't think to make enough
for your friends...

00:13:02.944 --> 00:13:06.903
but everything's laid out if you'd
like to cook for your husband.

00:13:06.981 --> 00:13:09.779
Yeah. Isn't she quaint?

00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:11.944
I'm just not hungry.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.548
So... are you enjoying your own
nubile little slave girl?

00:13:16.624 --> 00:13:19.855
She wanted to make me dinner.
At least she's not crying.

00:13:19.927 --> 00:13:22.725
I might.
Did she really make fresh bao?

00:13:22.797 --> 00:13:24.890
Quaint!

00:13:24.966 --> 00:13:29.130
- Remember that sex we were
planning to have ever again?
- You're all making a big deal.

00:13:29.203 --> 00:13:32.934
I would appreciate it if one person
on this boat would not assume...

00:13:33.007 --> 00:13:34.941
that I'm an evil, lecherous hump.

00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:36.943
Nobody's saying that, sir.

00:13:37.011 --> 00:13:39.912
We're pretty much just giving
each other significant glances...

00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:41.915
and laughing incessantly.

00:13:41.983 --> 00:13:44.781
- Is that cider?
- By the stove.

00:13:44.852 --> 00:13:47.844
Yum.
I'll get you a refill. Honey?

00:13:47.922 --> 00:13:50.482
That's for me to do.

00:13:54.495 --> 00:13:57.896
You know, uh, you weren't lyin'
about your cookin'.

00:13:57.965 --> 00:14:01.059
If I hadn't already eaten--

00:14:01.135 --> 00:14:05.595
- You don't want to finish?
- No, I just, um--

00:14:05.673 --> 00:14:08.767
I have captainy things to do,
but truthfully, that's a fine meal.

00:14:08.843 --> 00:14:10.777
- Thank you.
- Do you need anything else?

00:14:10.845 --> 00:14:12.779
No. No.

00:14:12.847 --> 00:14:16.647
Um, you just have something
to eat yourself, and, uh...

00:14:16.717 --> 00:14:19.311
and I'm gonna go... captain.

00:14:19.387 --> 00:14:20.952
If you're done with supper...

00:14:20.952 --> 00:14:22.317
If you're done with supper...

00:14:22.387 --> 00:14:25.618
would you like me
to wash your feet?

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.600
Beaumond.

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:44.574
- City of New Dunsmuir.
- [ Beeping ]

00:14:44.643 --> 00:14:46.702
Arrival: October 2 4.

00:14:46.778 --> 00:14:49.144
- Departure--
- Can I come in?

00:14:49.214 --> 00:14:52.411
- No.
- See? That's why I usually don't ask.

00:14:52.484 --> 00:14:54.543
What do you want?

00:14:54.619 --> 00:14:58.419
Oh, I just needed to... hide.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.721
- So I take it the honeymoon is over?
- Oh, she's a fine girl.

00:15:01.793 --> 00:15:03.852
Don't misread me.
A hell of a cook too.

00:15:03.929 --> 00:15:06.397
I'm sure she has
many exciting talents.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.598
Do you ever...

00:15:10.669 --> 00:15:13.570
wash your clients' feet?

00:15:13.638 --> 00:15:16.368
It's my specialty.

00:15:16.441 --> 00:15:19.933
- We'll be on Beaumond
at least two weeks, right?
- Can't exactly be sure.

00:15:20.011 --> 00:15:23.208
I need you to be exactly sure. I can't make
commitments and then not keep them.

00:15:23.281 --> 00:15:25.215
That's your specialty.

00:15:27.152 --> 00:15:30.747
Sorry. Are you touchy because I got myself
a bride or 'cause I don't plan to keep her?

00:15:30.822 --> 00:15:32.517
I find the whole thing degrading.

00:15:32.591 --> 00:15:35.924
That's just what Saffron said
about your line of work.

00:15:35.994 --> 00:15:40.522
Maybe you should think twice about letting go
of Saffron. You two sound like a match.

00:15:40.599 --> 00:15:43.932
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we're soul mates.

00:15:44.002 --> 00:15:46.869
Yes. Great. I wish you
hundreds of fat children.

00:15:46.938 --> 00:15:50.396
Could you imagine that? Me with
a whole passel of critters underfoot.

00:15:50.475 --> 00:15:54.536
- Hell, in ten years' time--
- Can you leave me alone
for five minutes, please?

00:16:05.557 --> 00:16:08.219
I wasn't lookin' for a fight.

00:16:14.499 --> 00:16:17.991
Always do seem
to find one, though.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.472
Do I have your attention?

00:16:25.844 --> 00:16:27.937
Kind of going to extremes here,
ain't we?

00:16:28.013 --> 00:16:32.416
There's times I think you don't take me
seriously. I think that oughta change.

00:16:32.484 --> 00:16:35.282
Do you think it's likely to?

00:16:35.353 --> 00:16:37.321
You got something
you don't deserve.

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:40.483
And it's brought me a galaxy of fun,
I'm here to tell ya.

00:16:42.327 --> 00:16:45.819
Six men came to kill me one time...

00:16:45.897 --> 00:16:47.990
and the best of them carried this.

00:16:48.066 --> 00:16:50.933
It's a Callahan full-bore auto lock.

00:16:51.002 --> 00:16:54.631
Customized trigger.
Double cartridge thorough gauge.

00:16:57.442 --> 00:17:00.536
It is my very favorite gun.

00:17:03.248 --> 00:17:07.184
[ Speaking Chinese ]
Are you offering me a trade?

00:17:07.252 --> 00:17:10.119
A trade? Hell, it's theft.

00:17:10.188 --> 00:17:13.180
This is the best damn gun made by man.
It has extreme sentimental value.

00:17:13.258 --> 00:17:17.160
- It's miles more worthy than what you got.
- What I got?

00:17:17.228 --> 00:17:19.662
- She has a name.
- So does this.

00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:21.665
I call it Vera.

00:17:21.733 --> 00:17:26.397
My days of not taking you seriously
are certainly comin' to a middle.

00:17:26.471 --> 00:17:29.804
- Damn it, Mal. I'd treat her okay.
- She's not to be bought.

00:17:29.874 --> 00:17:33.310
Nor bartered, or borrowed, or lent.

00:17:33.378 --> 00:17:36.370
She's a human woman, doesn't know a thing
about the world and needs our protection.

00:17:36.448 --> 00:17:38.416
- Well, I'll protect her.
-Jayne.

00:17:39.484 --> 00:17:41.418
Go play with your rain stick.

00:17:50.895 --> 00:17:52.829
[ Gasps ]

00:17:52.897 --> 00:17:56.230
[ Sighs ]
You do sneak about, don't you?

00:17:57.335 --> 00:17:59.269
You're a good man.

00:17:59.337 --> 00:18:02.602
You clearly haven't been talkin'
to anyone else on this boat.

00:18:02.674 --> 00:18:05.268
I don't wish to be wed
to the large one.

00:18:05.343 --> 00:18:08.244
I'd rather--
If I'm not to be yours...

00:18:08.313 --> 00:18:11.407
I'd rather have the work
you spoke of.

00:18:11.483 --> 00:18:14.611
I could be useful in a ranch.

00:18:14.686 --> 00:18:17.018
It's good work.

00:18:17.088 --> 00:18:20.922
My mama had a ranch back on Shadow,
where I'm from.

00:18:20.992 --> 00:18:23.790
Ran cattle, mostly.

00:18:23.862 --> 00:18:26.558
Wasn't nobody ran 'em
harder or smarter.

00:18:26.631 --> 00:18:30.192
She used to tell me, "Don't brand
the cattle. Brand the buyer.

00:18:30.268 --> 00:18:32.429
He's the one likely to stray."

00:18:32.504 --> 00:18:36.406
- She raised you herself?
- Well, her and about 40 hands.

00:18:36.474 --> 00:18:39.602
I had more family for a kid--

00:18:41.112 --> 00:18:44.741
- That is odd.
- What?

00:18:44.816 --> 00:18:47.114
I just don't--

00:18:47.185 --> 00:18:52.122
I'm not one who talks about what's past,
and here you got me--

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.750
Does your crew
never show interest in your life?

00:18:54.826 --> 00:18:58.990
No. They... are--

00:18:59.063 --> 00:19:01.429
They just know me
well enough to--

00:19:03.568 --> 00:19:07.163
Well, what about you?
What's your history?

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:11.902
Not much to say.

00:19:11.976 --> 00:19:15.275
Life like yours,
I figure you'd find mine terrible dull.

00:19:15.346 --> 00:19:17.507
Oh, I long for a little dullness.

00:19:17.582 --> 00:19:19.140
Truth to say...

00:19:19.217 --> 00:19:22.914
this whole trip's gettin' to be
just a little too interesting.

00:19:26.691 --> 00:19:28.716
- [ Man ] It's a wreck.
- [ Beeping ]

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.727
- [ Man #2 ] No, this is good.
- It's parts.

00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:33.127
A lot of cheap parts
we'll never unload.

00:19:33.198 --> 00:19:35.723
This is why you'll never
be in charge, Bree.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.429
- You don't see the whole. The parts are crap.
- I said exactly that.

00:19:39.504 --> 00:19:42.371
But you put it together,
you got a Firefly.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.500
Thing'll run forever,
they got a mechanic even half awake.

00:19:45.577 --> 00:19:47.568
It's got no flash.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:50.546
Some people ain't lookin' for flash.

00:19:50.615 --> 00:19:52.674
She's a good catch.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.344
She comes our way,
you prep the nets.

00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:03.685
Clearly, she's out of her mind.

00:20:03.761 --> 00:20:06.594
Really? She's led a sheltered life.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:09.656
Did you see the way
she grabbed that glass from you?

00:20:09.734 --> 00:20:12.532
Every planet has
its own weird customs.

00:20:12.604 --> 00:20:15.368
About a year before we met,
I spent six weeks on a moon...

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.376
where the principle form
of recreation was juggling geese.

00:20:19.444 --> 00:20:22.880
My hand to God. Baby geese.
Goslings. They were juggled.

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:27.882
Of course.
The man rushes in to defend her.

00:20:27.952 --> 00:20:29.817
I'm talking about geese.

00:20:29.888 --> 00:20:33.051
Captain shouldn't be baby-sitting
a damn groupie, and he knows it.

00:20:33.124 --> 00:20:35.149
Okay, when did this
become not funny?

00:20:35.226 --> 00:20:37.694
When you didn't put her ass
back down on Triumph.

00:20:37.762 --> 00:20:40.196
Oh, hey!
Now it's even my fault?

00:20:40.265 --> 00:20:43.598
Is there anything else on your mind
I should know about?

00:20:43.668 --> 00:20:46.660
- There's all sorts of twists
and cul-de-sacs. It's wild.
- She's trouble.

00:20:46.738 --> 00:20:49.969
I'm getting that.

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.339
I'm going to bed.

00:21:10.962 --> 00:21:12.896
Hey!

00:21:12.964 --> 00:21:14.898
Well,you're, uh...

00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:18.527
uh, well... there you are.

00:21:18.603 --> 00:21:21.037
I've made the bed warm for you.

00:21:21.105 --> 00:21:24.268
It-- It looks, uh... warm.

00:21:24.342 --> 00:21:27.140
And I've made myself
ready for you.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.941
Let's ride right past the part where you
explain exactly what that means.

00:21:33.017 --> 00:21:35.315
Didn't you see you got a room
of your own?

00:21:35.386 --> 00:21:37.411
And I'm to sleep there?

00:21:37.488 --> 00:21:39.422
That's the notion...

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.948
assuming you're--yeah-- sleepy.

00:21:44.295 --> 00:21:46.820
But we've been wed.
Aren't we to become one flesh?

00:21:46.898 --> 00:21:49.867
Well, no.
Uh, we're still two fleshes here...

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:54.667
and I think that your flesh
oughta sleep somewhere else.

00:21:54.739 --> 00:21:57.173
I'm sorry.
When we talked, I'd hoped--

00:21:57.241 --> 00:21:59.175
Whoa, hey. Flesh.

00:21:59.243 --> 00:22:02.110
Um... Saffron...

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.842
i-it-- it ain't a question
of pleasing me.

00:22:04.916 --> 00:22:08.317
It's more a question of what's--

00:22:08.386 --> 00:22:11.981
um, of what's morally right.

00:22:12.056 --> 00:22:15.287
I do know my Bible, sir.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.988
"On the night of their betrothal...

00:22:18.062 --> 00:22:22.158
"the wife shall open to the man
as the furrow to the plow...

00:22:22.233 --> 00:22:25.202
"and he shall work in her...

00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:27.294
"in and again...

00:22:27.372 --> 00:22:29.704
"till she bring him to his full...

00:22:29.774 --> 00:22:32.436
and rest him then
upon the sweat of her breast."

00:22:34.112 --> 00:22:37.843
Oh. Good Bible.

00:22:37.915 --> 00:22:41.817
I'm not skilled, sir,
nor a pleasure to look upon.

00:22:41.886 --> 00:22:44.719

00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:47.781
You're pleasing. You're, uh--

00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:51.852
Hell, you're all kinds of pleasin'...

00:22:51.929 --> 00:22:55.296
and, uh, it's-- it's been a while--
a long damn while--

00:22:55.366 --> 00:22:58.062
since anybody but me
took ahold of my plow...

00:22:58.136 --> 00:23:00.969
so don't think for a second
that I ain't interested.

00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:04.031
But you and me,
we ain't married.

00:23:04.108 --> 00:23:08.374
Just 'cause you got handed to me by some
[ Chinese ] who couldn't pay off his debts...

00:23:08.446 --> 00:23:11.438
don't make you beholden to me.

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:13.814
- I keep trying to explain.
- Let me explain.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.952
I lived my life in the maiden house...

00:23:18.022 --> 00:23:21.355
waiting to be married off for trade.

00:23:21.426 --> 00:23:25.658

with ugly men...

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.563
vicious or blubberous...

men with appetites...

00:23:31.069 --> 00:23:33.401
too unseemly to speak on.

00:23:34.672 --> 00:23:37.402
And I've cried for those girls.

00:23:39.343 --> 00:23:42.540
But not half so hard as I cried
the night they gave me to you.

00:23:44.949 --> 00:23:46.883
Why?

00:23:46.951 --> 00:23:48.885

00:37:00.827 --> 00:37:02.761
Scrap shop.

00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:06.128
Takes ships, pulls them apart
or fixes them up.

00:37:06.199 --> 00:37:09.066
-Doesn't sound that scary.
-That pattern you're looking at is a net.

00:37:09.135 --> 00:37:11.296
We fall into that,
we're more than helpless.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:15.067
It'll turn the ship into one big electrical
conduit, burn us all from the inside out.

00:37:15.141 --> 00:37:17.268
Some of the newer ones
will just hold you...

00:37:17.343 --> 00:37:20.608
and then the scrappers
will override the air locks...

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.843
pull the O2 or just gas you.

00:37:23.916 --> 00:37:26.510
They're not looking
to deal with survivors.

00:37:26.586 --> 00:37:29.680
One day you're gonna tell us all how
a preacher knows so much about crime.

00:37:29.755 --> 00:37:32.747
- Kaylee?
- I'm trying, sir.

00:37:32.825 --> 00:37:35.191
Keep on it.
We can't fall into that net.

00:37:35.261 --> 00:37:37.991
We're gonna need a Plan "B."

00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:44.292
Zoe, get our suits prepped now.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.304
I figure we got one shot at this.

00:37:46.372 --> 00:37:48.863
- Give me a visual as soon as we're close.
- It won't be long.

00:37:48.941 --> 00:37:51.842
What do I do?

00:37:51.911 --> 00:37:53.845
You go get Vera.

00:37:55.448 --> 00:37:58.440
She needs oxygen around her to fire her,
and we don't have a case.

00:37:58.518 --> 00:38:00.679
- We're gonna use a suit.
- Here, we got it.

00:38:00.753 --> 00:38:03.017
What am I aimin' for, the window?

00:38:03.089 --> 00:38:05.683
That might kill some folk,
but it won't short the net.

00:38:05.758 --> 00:38:08.192
See these six points where it's
brightest? Those are the breakers.

00:38:08.261 --> 00:38:10.491
Hit one of those,
should short it out.

00:38:10.563 --> 00:38:12.622
What do you mean, "should"?

00:38:33.319 --> 00:38:35.253
[ Mal ]
You see it?

00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:38.882
Clear as day. See, Vera?

00:38:38.958 --> 00:38:42.394
Dress yourself up,
you get taken out somewhere fun.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.524
- [ Beeping ]
- We got it.

00:39:16.596 --> 00:39:18.530
It's not pretty...

00:39:18.598 --> 00:39:21.089
but we can steer enough
to turn the hell around.

00:39:21.167 --> 00:39:24.625
- Nice work, Kaylee.
- Not soon enough to help.

00:39:24.704 --> 00:39:27.195
Hey, it's a lot easier to pull things
apart than it is to put 'em right.

00:39:27.273 --> 00:39:29.571
You're still
the best mechanic floatin'.

00:39:29.642 --> 00:39:34.238
- Captain, don't you know
kissing girls makes you sleepy?
- Sometimes I can't help myself.

00:39:34.313 --> 00:39:37.646
Now, let's go visiting.

00:39:47.526 --> 00:39:50.962
Honey, I'm home.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.503
Looks like you get
that wedding night after all.

00:40:04.677 --> 00:40:07.805
[ Panting ]
It's the first time, darlin'.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.316
- I think you should be gentle with me.
- You gonna kill me?

00:40:11.384 --> 00:40:14.285
Can you conjure up a terribly
compelling reason for me not to?

00:40:14.353 --> 00:40:16.913
I didn't kill you.

00:40:16.989 --> 00:40:19.514
You handed me and my crew over to those
that would kill us. That buys you nothing.

00:40:19.592 --> 00:40:21.685
I made you dinner.

00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:25.788
Why the act? All the seduction games,
the dancing about folk.

00:40:25.865 --> 00:40:28.425
There has to be
an easier way to steal.

00:40:28.501 --> 00:40:31.026
You're assuming
the payoff is the point.

00:40:31.103 --> 00:40:34.539
- I'm not assuming anything at this juncture.
- How'd you find me?

00:40:34.607 --> 00:40:38.839
Only a few places that shuttle
would make it to from where you left.

00:40:38.911 --> 00:40:40.845
Happy to find it intact.

00:40:42.248 --> 00:40:44.773
You're quite a man,
Malcolm Reynolds.

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:49.184
I've been waiting a long time for
someone good enough to take me down.

00:40:49.255 --> 00:40:51.655
Saffron...

00:40:51.724 --> 00:40:54.215
you even think about
playing me again...

00:40:54.293 --> 00:40:56.727
I will riddle you with holes.

00:40:56.796 --> 00:40:58.855
Everybody plays each other.

00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:02.059
That's all anybody ever does.
We play parts.

00:41:02.134 --> 00:41:05.729
You got all kinds of learnin', and you
made me look the fool without tryin'...

00:41:05.805 --> 00:41:09.832
and yet here I am
with a gun to your head.

00:41:09.909 --> 00:41:12.901
That's 'cause I got people with me,
people who trust each other...

00:41:12.978 --> 00:41:16.505
who do for each other and ain't
always lookin' for the advantage.

00:41:16.582 --> 00:41:19.176
Promise me you're
gonna kill me soon.

00:41:19.251 --> 00:41:21.719
Oh, you already know I ain't gonna.

00:41:23.289 --> 00:41:25.223
You know, you did pretty well.

00:41:25.291 --> 00:41:29.625
Most men, they're on me
inside of ten minutes...

00:41:29.695 --> 00:41:32.664
not tryin' to teach me
to be strong and the like.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.134
I got one question for ya...

00:41:36.202 --> 00:41:38.830
just one thing
I'd like to know straight up.

00:41:38.904 --> 00:41:41.338
Ask me.

00:41:41.407 --> 00:41:43.602
What's your real name?

00:41:51.283 --> 00:41:54.446
[ Sighs ]
You'd only have lied anyhow.

00:41:55.788 --> 00:41:59.781
- [ Knocking ]
- Come in.

00:41:59.859 --> 00:42:01.952
Back on course.

00:42:02.027 --> 00:42:05.155
Be on Beaumond a day or two late.
Hope it's all right.

00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:07.392
It should be fine, thank you.

00:42:07.466 --> 00:42:09.400
And does the vixen live?

00:42:09.468 --> 00:42:12.665
Yeah, if you can call it that.

00:42:12.738 --> 00:42:14.729
All's well, I suppose.

00:42:14.807 --> 00:42:17.071
Yes.

00:42:19.812 --> 00:42:22.406
You're a very graceful woman, Inara.

00:42:22.481 --> 00:42:24.745
I--

00:42:24.817 --> 00:42:26.751
Thank you.

00:42:28.421 --> 00:42:30.855
So here's where I'm fuzzy.

00:42:30.923 --> 00:42:34.381
You got by that girl,
came and found me...

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.361
and somehow you happened
to just trip and fall.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.263
- What do you mean?
- Come on, Inara.

00:42:40.332 --> 00:42:43.324
How's about we don't play?

00:42:43.402 --> 00:42:45.734
You didn't just trip, did you?

00:42:49.074 --> 00:42:51.008
No.

00:42:51.076 --> 00:42:53.738
Well, isn't that something?

00:42:55.881 --> 00:42:57.815
I knew you let her kiss you.

00:43:03.522 --> 00:43:06.582
[ Whistling ]

00:43:06.659 --> 00:43:09.150
[ Door Opens, Closes ]

00:43:48.901 --> 00:43:51.836
Grr! Arrgh!

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
