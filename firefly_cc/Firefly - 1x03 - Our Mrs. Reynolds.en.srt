- [ Kaylee ] Not a gorram thing.

- Get that stuff stored.

exhaust through a bypass system...

you have a-- a tendency to inspire

You were stationed on Hara

I believe you might be right.

a pretty crushing defeat there.

Some say that after Serenity
the browncoats were through...

00:36:10,431 --> 00:36:12,160
that the war ended in that valley.

495
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:14,292
Hmm.

496
00:36:14,368 --> 00:36:18,065
Seems odd you'd name your ship after
a battle you were on the wrong side of.

497
00:36:18,139 --> 00:36:22,337
May have been the losing side.
Still not convinced it was the wrong one.

498
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,144
Is that why you attacked
that transport?

499
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:31,207
- What?
- You're still fighting the same battle.

500

Only those weren't soldiers
you murdered.

They were civilians, families,
citizens loyal to the Alliance...

trying to make a new life,
and you just can't stand that, can you?

So we attacked that ship, then brought
the only survivor to our infirmary.

to be concerned about right now.

- It.
- The darkness.

He probably tried to turn away.
They wouldn't let him.

You call him a survivor.
He's not.

A man comes up against
that kind of will...

the only way to deal with it,
I suspect, is to become it.
