332
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:02,289
[ Woman ] They brought home a doctor.
Thank the Lord.

333
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:05,132
[ Man ] Come on. We have to go
down there and see.

334
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:10,133
[ Man ]
What is it?

335
00:23:19,018 --> 00:23:22,886
"Dear Diary, Today I was pompous,
and my sister was crazy.

336
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:26,288
"Today we were kidnapped
by hill folk, never to be seen again.

337
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:28,883
It was the best day ever."

338
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:32,320
Now we're talkin'.

339
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:40,167
Amazing we kept 'em
this long.

340
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:54,281
- Can I--
- Sure.

341
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:56,446
He's out, though.

342
00:23:58,424 --> 00:24:01,951
He did this for me once.

343
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:05,121
[ Sighs ]
How's he doin'?

344
00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:07,529
I cleaned it out,
wrapped it up.

345
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,363
Best I could do.

346
00:24:10,436 --> 00:24:13,030

347
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:16,506
Well, we're headed
for help, right?

348
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:19,271
Captain will
come up with a plan.

349
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:22,542
Well, that's good. Right?

350
00:24:22,614 --> 00:24:25,549
Possible you're not recalling
some of his previous plans.

351
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:33,520
We left them back there.

352
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,721
Yeah.

353
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:41,461
Don't seem right.

354
00:24:41,533 --> 00:24:43,933
You sure this is
where you want to be?

355
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:46,369
Oh, I'm fairly
certain it ain't.

[ Radio Static ]

357
00:24:54,913 --> 00:24:57,143
Be sure to ask nicely.

358
00:24:57,216 --> 00:25:00,743

is Firefly transport Serenity...

00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:05,279

for docking.

I don't figure it's
as fancy as you're used to...

363
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:19,004
but it's what we got.

364
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:20,595
I got you a doctor.

365
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:22,606
Oh, praise the Lord.

366
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,204
Doralee here'll
show you what's what.

367
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,213
- What's your name?
- Simon.

368
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:32,045
Well, hello there.
Who are you?

This is River.

Has there been a--
Is there a sickness here?

372
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:51,267
Nothing special.
Just people get sick or injured.

373
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:54,965
Mostly people heal on their own,
but sometimes--

374
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,565
Sometimes you need a doctor.

375
00:25:59,812 --> 00:26:04,340
- [ Woman Coughing ]
- Bring me light and any supplies you have.

376

You sanguine about the kind of reception
we're apt to receive on an Alliance ship?

377
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:23,901
Absolutely.
What's ''sanguine'' mean?

378
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:28,633
Sanguine. Hopeful. Plus, point of interest,
it also means ''bloody.''

379
00:26:28,707 --> 00:26:31,574
- [ Bell Buzzing ]
- That pretty much covers
all the options, don't it?

380
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:43,086
We're requesting aid.
No other purpose.

381
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:45,089
We got papers.

382
00:26:45,157 --> 00:26:47,955
What's your business?

383
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:52,486
We're a supply ship, freelance. Had an accident
this morning. A crewman got hurt.

384
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:56,364
- We need medical help.
- Fast would be better than slow.

Bystander in a gunfight
back on Jiangyin. You can check.

389
00:27:11,183 --> 00:27:13,708
Not he nor any of ours
were the aggressors.

390
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:17,516
We aren't an emergency facility, Captain.
Our services aren't available simply to anyone--

Get this man
to the infirmary at once.

[ Doralee ]
She's not quite right, is she?

396
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:59,858
[ Simon ] She's been through
some trauma. She's recovering, though.

397
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:06,396
She won't get a good conversation
out of Ruby. I can tell you that much.

398
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,803
That little girl's mute.

399
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:12,173
Do you know the cause?
Was she born deaf?

400
00:28:12,244 --> 00:28:16,078
No. She was fine until two years ago
when she stopped talking.

401
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,615
A place like this
might be good for your sister.

402
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:25,350
Quiet, safe. A place where
folks take care of each other.

403
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:30,420
Mmm, yes. Seems like a lovely
little community of kidnappers.

404
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:34,388
- The Lord says judge not.
- They took us off the street.

405
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,018
Sometimes life takes you places
you weren't expectin' to go.

406
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:40,621
Life didn't bring us here.
Those men did.

407
00:28:40,697 --> 00:28:44,656
You were on a transport ship,
right? Takin' a journey?

408
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:47,568
It's the way of life in my
findings that journeys end...

409
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:50,834
when and where they want to,
and that's where you make your home.

410
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:53,671
This isn't our home.

411
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:57,145
If it isn't here,
where is it?

412
00:29:00,884 --> 00:29:05,082
[ Sighs ] This place gives me
an uncomfortableness.

413
00:29:05,155 --> 00:29:10,024
So what do you figure? Shepherd's got
some kind of connection with the Alliance?

414
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:13,392
I know what it looks like.
Still, it would surprise me if he did.

See? That's my whole problem
with pickin' up tourists.

416

They ain't never
what they claim to be.

You have to eat.

00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:14,613
Hodgeberries.

429
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:21,059
Do you remember when we found those giant
hodgeberry bushes on the Cambersons' estate?

430
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:24,430
And we thought they'd
grown wild, but--

431
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:29,803
It was a long while ago.

- No.

I know I did.

You don't think I do, but--

435
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:45,655
I get confused.

436
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:50,760
I remember everything.

437
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:53,261
I remember too much.

438
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,855
And some of it's made up...

439
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:59,891

can't be quantified...

about doing the same.

have to sleep here.

It's true

- Pretty nearly.

You have no idea
how far down you can go...

501
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,266
- and you're not taking us with you.
- Meaning what?

502
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:59,069
I won't come
for you again.

503
00:34:59,142 --> 00:35:02,839
You end up here or get
mixed up in something worse...

504
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:05,005
you're on your own.

505
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:08,573
I will not come for you.

506
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,749
Now, are you coming home?

507
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:20,457
- [ Bell Clanging ]
- This is lunacy!

508
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,261
You're supposed to be the teacher here.
What exactly is it that you teach?

509
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:28,327
What's going on, woman? Why are you
knocking us from our beds at this hour?

510
00:35:28,405 --> 00:35:32,739
The new doctor's sister's a witch. She
read Ruby's mind, saw things she couldn't.

511
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:37,473
No, River is not a witch!
She's just a troubled girl.

512
00:35:37,547 --> 00:35:39,412
I'm sure that's true.

513
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:45,480
You're not a witch, are you?
[ Speaking Chinese ]

514
00:35:45,555 --> 00:35:48,752
I'm the patron here.
Do you know what that means?

515
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:51,623
Yes. You're in charge.

516
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:54,989
Ever since
the old patron died.

517
00:35:55,064 --> 00:35:56,292
That's right.

518
00:35:56,366 --> 00:36:00,097
He was sick...
and he was getting better.

519
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,230
You were alone
in the room with him.

520
00:36:03,306 --> 00:36:04,933
- [ Gasps ]
- No!

521
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:07,875
[ Patron ] This girl reads minds
and spins falsehoods.

522
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:10,936
She's a witch, and we must
purge the devil from her. With fire.

523
00:36:11,014 --> 00:36:13,676
[ Screaming ]

524
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:25,653
[ Mal ] You're gonna be fine, Shepherd.
Alliance patched you up.

525
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,662
Alliance?

526
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:31,427
Yeah. They let us come,
and they let us go.

527
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:35,801
What kind of ident card gets us
that kind of reception and send-off?

528
00:36:35,872 --> 00:36:41,276
I am a shepherd.
Folks like a man of God.

529
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,940
No, they don't. Men of God
make everyone feel guilty and judged.

530
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:48,540
That's not what I saw.

531
00:36:48,618 --> 00:36:52,349
You like to tell me
what really happened?

532
00:36:52,422 --> 00:36:57,860
I surely would...
and maybe someday I will.

533
00:36:59,629 --> 00:37:03,030
[ Sighs ]
It's good to be home.

534
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:09,037
Badger just hailed us.
Getting impatient for his share.

535
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:12,040
Wants us to drop it to his men
on the common fed base.

536
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:16,135
That'll be a hell of a lot easier to do
without the two most wanted on board.

537
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:19,409
Life would look to be simpler
with us not carrying 'fugees.

538
00:37:19,482 --> 00:37:21,416
He is right, you know.

539
00:37:22,952 --> 00:37:25,853
Yeah. Simpler.

[ Chattering, Shouting ]

541
00:37:40,103 --> 00:37:44,767
Take me instead.
Take my life for hers.

542
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:48,402
The witch must die.
God commands it.

543
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,509
[ Man ]
Up here.

544
00:37:54,817 --> 00:37:56,751
No! Get away from her!

545
00:38:05,428 --> 00:38:08,124
She has done nothing to you!

546
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:14,398
If she dies tonight, it won't
be God's will that killed her.

547
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:19,032
It'll be you! Your lunacy!
Your ignorance!

[ Townspeople Murmuring ]

549
00:38:38,194 --> 00:38:41,561
That's not gonna
stop us, Doctor.

Digging holes for posts.

[ Gasps, Shouting ]

555
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:31,138
Well, look at this. Appears we got
herejust in the nick of time.

556
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:33,148
What does that make us?

557
00:39:33,216 --> 00:39:36,982
- Big damn heroes, sir.
- Ain't we just?

558

Sorry to interrupt, folks.

559
00:39:39,222 --> 00:39:41,520
Y'all got somethin'
that belongs to us...

560
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:43,525
and we'd like it back.

561
00:39:43,593 --> 00:39:47,359
This is a holy cleansing.
You cannot think to thwart God's will.

Y'all see the man hangin' out
of the spaceship with the really big gun?

I'm not sayin'
you weren't easy to find.

564
00:39:55,204 --> 00:39:58,537
But it was kinda out of our way,
and he didn't want to come.

565
00:39:58,608 --> 00:40:00,701
Man's lookin'
to kill some folk.

566
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:05,373
So really it's his will y'all
should worry about thwarting.

567
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:10,818
Gotta say, Doctor,
[ Inaudible ] it's near miraculous.

568
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:13,754
Yes, I'm very proud.

00:40:13,823 --> 00:40:17,259
- Cut her down.
- The girl is a witch.

570
00:40:17,326 --> 00:40:22,730
Yeah, but she's our witch,
so cut her the hell down.

Hey, Doctor. Glad you're
back now on the ship.

00:40:35,278 --> 00:40:37,212
Thanks.
