338
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:08,322
I'm sorry, Captain. I'm real sorry.

339
00:22:08,398 --> 00:22:11,265
I should've kept better care of her.

340
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:14,360
Usually she lets me know
when somethin's wrong.

341
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:17,134
Maybe she did. I just wasn't
payin'attention or--

342
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:19,835
Kaylee, I cannot be having
this from you right now.

- Come on.

348
00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:40,956
All right. Where's it go?

349
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:46,861
Here. But it don't fit no more.

350
00:22:46,937 --> 00:22:49,963

364

So...

369
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:09,810
instead of focusing on what we don't got,
time to talk about what it is we do.

370
00:24:09,886 --> 00:24:12,411
And what we got
are two shuttles--

371
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:15,890
short range, won't go far.

372
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:18,792
But each got heat,
and they each got air.

373
00:24:18,862 --> 00:24:21,353
Last longer than
what's left on Serenity.

- No.

377
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:33,366

getting seen, maybe picked up.

with Wash and Zoe, seeing as how...

382
00:24:44,554 --> 00:24:46,647
Zoe still needs some doctorin'.

383
00:24:46,723 --> 00:24:52,684
- What about you?
- Four people per shuttle.
That's the arrangement.

384
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:55,458

390
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:20,484

someone might answer the beacon.

391
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:23,219
And when they do, I want to make
sure that you can call everyone back.

392

- And as far as your security deposit goes...

- Smallish.

How much room do you really need
for what you do anyway?

408
00:26:17,213 --> 00:26:20,410

interested in renting it.

409

They're just waiting to hear back.

410
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:25,712
- What's her range?
- Standard short.

411
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:28,121
She'll break atmo
from a wide orbit...

412
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:32,150
get you where you need to go,
bring you back home again.

413
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:35,561
She's space-worthy,
just like the rest of Serenity is.

414
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:39,193
No need to sound
so defensive, Captain.

415
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:42,796
I prefer something
with a few miles on it.

416
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:45,932
Were we to enter into this
arrangement, Captain Reynolds...

417
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:51,914
there are a few things I would require from
you-- the foremost being complete autonomy.

418
00:26:51,982 --> 00:26:55,748
The shuttle would be my home.
No crew member, including yourself...

419
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:59,186
- would be allowed entrance
without my express invitation.
- You'd get your privacy.

420
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:03,214
Andjust so we're clear, under no
circumstances will I be servicing you...

421
00:27:03,293 --> 00:27:05,261
or anyone who is
under your employ.

422
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:09,230
- I'll post a sign.
- That won't be necessary.

423
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,427
The other thing I would insist upon
is some measure of assurance...

424
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:14,493
that when I make
an appointment with a client...

425
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:17,369
I'm in a position
to keep that appointment.

426
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,103
So far as such assurances
are possible on a vessel of this type.

427
00:27:21,177 --> 00:27:23,771
That's an awful lot
of caveats and addendums there, miss.

428
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:26,372
As I stated,
I just want to be clear.

429
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:29,941
Well, I'll be sure to take all that into
consideration while I review the applications.

430
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,989
Don't be ridiculous.
You're gonna rent this shuttle to me.

431
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:35,286
- Am I?
- Yes.

432
00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:38,020
And for one quarter less
than your asking price.

433
00:27:38,094 --> 00:27:41,188
- Is that a fact?
- It is.

434
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:44,427
And you figure
you'll be getting this discount...

435
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:47,834
- why, exactly?
- You want me.

436
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:51,135
You want me on your ship.

437
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:53,801
- Do I?
- Yes.

438
00:27:53,877 --> 00:27:56,141
Because I can bring
something that your surveyor...

439
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:59,477
or any of the other fish
you might have on-line can't--

440
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:02,040
- a certain respectability.
- Respecta--

441
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:05,849
And based on what little
I've seen of your operation...

442
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:08,914
I suspect that's
something you could use.

443
00:28:11,394 --> 00:28:15,057
Fine.
Let me ask you this.

444
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:19,363
If you're so respectable,
why are you even here?

445
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:22,837

fancy ladies such as yourself...

- I'm not running from anything.

you might want to consider another ship.

you get to call me ''whore.''

- It was the catalyzer.
