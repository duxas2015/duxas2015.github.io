would find room for some of this.

and get to the engine room.

- What?
-[ Kaylee ] We heard shootin'.

00:16:12.631 --> 00:16:14.622
I followed the voices.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.635
- Don't ever leave the ship. Not ever.
- Handle her, will you, son?

- [ Wash On Radio ]
What in the [ Chinese ] is going on?
- Not now, dear.

[ Panting ]
Didn't.

Came at me from behind.
Big, though.

00:16:43.328 --> 00:16:45.523
Strong.

00:16:45.597 --> 00:16:47.997
- I think I might have hit him.
- You did.

No. No, no.

Shh. Easy, now.

00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:15.392
No one's gonna hurt you.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.123
- No. No mercy. No.
- Any more than we already did.

00:17:19.197 --> 00:17:21.495
- No mercy.
- We got lots of mercy.

[ Simon ]
Oh,yes.

00:17:37.282 --> 00:17:40.718
He's a real beast.

00:17:40.786 --> 00:17:43.050
It's a wonder you're still alive.

00:17:43.121 --> 00:17:46.215
Looked bigger
when I couldn't see him.

00:17:49.227 --> 00:17:51.661
I wonder how long
he'd been living like that.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.664
Don't know.

00:17:53.732 --> 00:17:57.327
He must be real brave to survive
like that when nobody else did.

00:17:57.402 --> 00:18:00.838
[ Sniffs ] Yeah. Real hero,

00:18:00.906 --> 00:18:03.841
[ Kaylee ] What?
No, we don't believe that.

00:18:07.245 --> 00:18:09.213
We don't, do we?

00:18:09.281 --> 00:18:11.943
Captain wouldn't have brought him
on board, were that the case.

00:18:12.017 --> 00:18:14.008
[ Simon ]
Pulse is rapid.

00:18:14.086 --> 00:18:17.214
Blood pressure's high side of normal--
to be expected.

00:18:17.289 --> 00:18:20.850
Weak. They were all weak.

00:18:20.926 --> 00:18:24.623
Other than the bullet wound, there
doesn't appear to be any exterior trauma.

00:18:24.696 --> 00:18:27.688
Though that crack to the head you gave
him probably didn't do him any good.

00:18:27.766 --> 00:18:30.701
[ Grunts, Panting ]
Cattle.

00:18:30.769 --> 00:18:33.294
Cattle for the slaughter.

- Just do it.

No mercy.

So? How's our patient?

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.514
Uh, aside from
borderline malnutrition...

00:19:17.582 --> 00:19:19.516
he's in remarkably good health.

00:19:19.584 --> 00:19:21.313
So he'll live, then?

00:19:21.386 --> 00:19:23.946
Which, to my mind, is unfortunate.

00:19:24.022 --> 00:19:26.115
Not a very charitable
attitude, Captain.

- Charity'd be putting a bullet in his brainpan.
- Mal!

00:19:29.161 --> 00:19:31.425
It'd save him the suffering.

00:19:34.633 --> 00:19:36.658
All right. No one goes in here.

not after what he's seen.

He don't, that's how. No way.

It was that other fella,
the one we run into.

Like I said before, he went stir crazy,
killed the rest, then took a walk in space.

- Just a second ago, you said--
- Don't matter what I said.

00:20:10.469 --> 00:20:12.528
Wasn't reavers.
Reavers don't leave no survivors.

Strictly speaking,
I wouldn't say they did.

00:20:14.806 --> 00:20:16.706
What are you suggesting?

Don't matter we took him
off that boat, Shepherd.

00:20:19.578 --> 00:20:22.513
It's the place he's gonna live
from now on.

00:20:22.581 --> 00:20:24.947
I don't accept that.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:27.951
Whatever horror he witnessed,
whatever acts of barbarism...

00:20:28.019 --> 00:20:30.681
it was done by men,
nothing more.

00:20:30.756 --> 00:20:34.317
- Reavers ain't men.
- Of course they are.

00:20:34.392 --> 00:20:38.658
Too long removed from civilization,
perhaps, but men.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.858
And I believe there's a power
greater than men.

00:20:41.933 --> 00:20:44.527
A power that heals.

00:20:44.603 --> 00:20:47.071
Reavers might take issue
with that philosophy...

00:20:47.139 --> 00:20:49.073
if they had a philosophy...

00:20:49.141 --> 00:20:53.077
and if they weren't too busy
gnawing on your insides.

00:20:53.145 --> 00:20:56.376
Jayne's right.
Reavers ain't men.

00:20:56.448 --> 00:20:59.747
Or they forgot how to be.
Come to just nothin'.

00:20:59.818 --> 00:21:02.753
They got out to the edge of the galaxy,
to that place of nothin'...

00:21:02.821 --> 00:21:04.755
and that's what they became.

00:21:04.823 --> 00:21:08.224
Why are we still sittin' here?
If it was reavers, shouldn't we be gone?

00:21:08.293 --> 00:21:12.127
Work ain't done. Still substantial

00:21:12.197 --> 00:21:15.132
Oh, I ain't goin' over there
with them bodies.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.033

Maybe see what I can do
about putting those folks to rest.

00:21:31.483 --> 00:21:34.543
Those folks are already restin' pretty
good, Shepherd. Reavers saw to that.

00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:38.214
How we treat our dead
is part of what makes us different...

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.451

00:21:44.729 --> 00:21:47.721

and Shepherd Book cut down those people.

00:21:51.069 --> 00:21:54.038
- Then you'll load up the cargo.

Yes, Jayne, that is exactly
what we're gonna do.

Not gonna have these people lookin'
over my shoulder once we're gone.

00:22:01.847 --> 00:22:04.111
I ain't sayin'
there's any peace to be had...

00:22:04.182 --> 00:22:09.518
but on the off chance there is,
those folks deserve a little of it.

Just when I think
I've got you figured out.

00:22:24.002 --> 00:22:26.869
That was real pretty, Captain,
what you just said.

00:22:26.938 --> 00:22:29.873
Didn't think you were one
for rituals and such.

00:22:29.941 --> 00:22:33.377
I'm not. But I figure it'll keep
the others busy for a while.

00:22:33.445 --> 00:22:36.039
No reason to concern them
with what's to be done.

- What is that?
- Booby trap.

00:22:44.456 --> 00:22:46.720
Reavers sometimes leave 'em
for the rescue ships.

00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:49.692
- Triggered it when we latched on.
- And when we detach?

00:22:49.761 --> 00:22:51.524
It blows.

00:22:51.596 --> 00:22:54.827
Okay, so we don't detach.
We just, I don't know, sit tight until--

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.494
What, reavers come back?

00:22:57.569 --> 00:23:00.868
Looks like they've jerry-rigged it
with a pressure catch.

It's the only thing that'd work
with all these spare parts.

00:23:03.975 --> 00:23:07.069
We could probably bypass that easy,
we get to the D.C. line.

You really think you can do this?

Sir, we've identified the transport ship
they were attached to.

00:26:45.797 --> 00:26:48.857
It was licensed to a group of families
out of Bernadette.

00:27:59.103 --> 00:28:01.503
Might give them Alliance boys
the wrong impression.

00:28:01.573 --> 00:28:03.700
- Or the right one.
- That too.

00:28:03.775 --> 00:28:07.176
- Now, go fetch your sister.
- What?

00:28:10.648 --> 00:28:13.048
Why? Are you gonna put her
in plain sight too?

00:28:13.117 --> 00:28:15.984
Don't get touchy.
Just do as I say.

00:28:16.054 --> 00:28:19.387
Is that why you let us stay, so you
could use us as bargaining chips?

00:28:19.457 --> 00:28:22.392
- Knew there was a reason.
- You are not giving her to them.

Don't be a fool, son.

00:28:47.452 --> 00:28:50.580
Well, quite a lot of fuss.

00:28:50.655 --> 00:28:53.818
If I didn't know better,
I'd think we were dangerous.

00:28:56.227 --> 00:29:00.721
- Is this your vessel?
- It is. Bought and paid for.
I'm Captain Malcolm Reynolds.

00:29:00.798 --> 00:29:03.824
- And is this everyone, Captain?
- By way of crew, it is.

00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:07.393
Though in our infirmary,you're gonna find
a fella we rescued off that derelict.

00:29:07.472 --> 00:29:09.099
Saved him, guess you could say.

Mmm.

next to the common area.

you rescued them as well?

[ Man Cackling ]

00:29:33.264 --> 00:29:35.425
Looks to me like
an illegal salvage operation.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.060
It does? That's discouraging.

00:29:38.136 --> 00:29:40.297
Alliance property too.
You could lose your ship.

00:29:40.371 --> 00:29:44.137
But that is a wrist slap compared
to the penalty for harboring fugitives.

A brother and sister. When I search
this vessel, I won't find them, will I?

00:29:48.046 --> 00:29:49.877
No children on this boat.

00:29:49.947 --> 00:29:53.041
Mmm. I didn't say children.

00:29:53.117 --> 00:29:56.211
Siblings. Adult siblings.

00:29:56.287 --> 00:29:58.847
- I misunderstood.
- Mmm.

00:30:01.526 --> 00:30:03.960
No chance
they could have stowed away?

00:30:04.028 --> 00:30:05.962
No one would blame you
for that, Captain.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.626
I know how these older-model Fireflies
tend to have those troublesome little nooks.

00:30:10.702 --> 00:30:12.795
Do they?

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:16.931

prefer them just for that reason.

of this junker tossed.

- "Junker"?
- Settle down, Kaylee.

But, Captain, did you hear
what that purple-belly called Serenity?

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.321
[ Mal ]
Shut up.

Get him outta here.

- [ Commander ] You are a Companion.
- [ Inara ] Yes.

00:31:02.623 --> 00:31:05.183
And you were based for years
on Sihnon.

00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:08.194
It's only in the last year that you've
been shipping out with The Serenity?

00:31:08.262 --> 00:31:10.196
It's just Serenity,
and that's correct.

00:31:10.264 --> 00:31:13.358
In a few weeks
it will be a year.

00:31:13.434 --> 00:31:16.699
- Why is this important?
- I'm just trying to put the pieces together.

00:31:16.771 --> 00:31:19.865
It's a, uh-- It's a curiosity...

such as yourself...

falling in with... these types.

00:31:24.445 --> 00:31:28.939
Not in the least. It's a mutually
beneficial business arrangement.

00:31:29.016 --> 00:31:32.884
I rent the shuttle from Capt. Reynolds,
which allows me to expand my client base...

00:31:32.954 --> 00:31:36.720
and the captain finds that
having a Companion on board...

00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:39.851
opens certain doors that might
otherwise be closed to him.

00:31:39.927 --> 00:31:43.590
- And do you love him?
- I don't see how that's relevant.

00:31:43.664 --> 00:31:46.132
- Well, he is your husband.
- Yes.

00:31:47.435 --> 00:31:49.426
You two met
through Capt. Reynolds?

00:31:49.504 --> 00:31:52.439
Captain was looking for a pilot.
I found a husband.

00:31:52.507 --> 00:31:54.202
Seemed to work out.

00:31:54.275 --> 00:31:57.244
- You fought with Reynolds in the war?
- Fought with a lot of people.

00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:59.609
- And your husband.
- Fight with him sometimes too.

00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:04.814
Is there any particular reason
you don't wish to discuss your marriage?

00:32:04.886 --> 00:32:08.583
Don't see that it's
any of your business is all.

We're very private people.

[ Chuckling ] Oh, yeah.
Definitely have to say it was her legs.

You can put that down.

Six gerstlers crammed
under every cooling drive...

so that you strain
your primary artery function...

00:32:32.046 --> 00:32:35.413
and you end up having to recycle secondary
exhaust through a bypass system...

00:32:35.483 --> 00:32:38.748
just so's you don't end up pumping it
through the main atmofeed...

00:32:38.819 --> 00:32:40.810
and asphyxiating the entire crew.

There's an oddity.

Not the only oddity
this end of space, Commander...

00:33:11.719 --> 00:33:15.519
where things aren't always so plain
as on the central planets.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.115

These fugitives that we're looking for--
the brother and the sister.

- They were last seen on Persephone.
- That a fact?

00:33:25.933 --> 00:33:28.868
They also left port aboard
a Firefly-class transport...

00:33:28.936 --> 00:33:32.064
just about the same time
that you shipped out with Serenity.

00:33:32.139 --> 00:33:35.575
Well, Persephone's a big place.

00:33:35.643 --> 00:33:39.340
Yes. Yes, it is.
And that Firefly isn't.

anywhere on it...

you won't tow it back.

Just fire the whole gorram thing
from space, be done with it.

00:36:10.431 --> 00:36:12.160
that the war ended in that valley.

Hmm.

00:36:14.368 --> 00:36:18.065
Seems odd you'd name your ship after
a battle you were on the wrong side of.
