I might as well become a petty thief like you.

163
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:27,041
Petty?

164
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,806
- I didn't mean petty.
- What did you mean?

165
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,246
[ Chinese ]

166
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:34,476
That's Chinese for "petty."

167
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:38,715
No, that's a narrow--
There are nuances of meaning--

168
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:43,123
Maybe you should've stuck
with your wiles.

169
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:46,492
Don't put all of this on me, Mal.

170
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:48,827
You know you haven't been
after serious work--

171
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,094
Serious work?

172
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,604
You want to know-- If-- I--

173
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:58,664
- What?
- Nothin'.

174
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,410
All right. Tell me more
about this job of yours.

175
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:17,860
[ Saffron ]
The mark's name is Durran Haymer.

176
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:22,262
He may be one of the biggest collectors of
Earth-That-Was artifacts in the 'verse.

177
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:24,857
Guy's got warehouses full of stuff.

178
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:27,836
But his prize piece
is sitting in his parlor--

179
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:31,101
an antiquity of unspeakable value--
the Lassiter.

180
00:12:31,174 --> 00:12:34,302
The original handheld
laser pistol.

181
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:36,675
One of only two known
to still exist.

182
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:39,544
The forerunner of all modern
laser technology.

183
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:42,278
Haymer got lucky, picked it up
during the war for nothing.

184
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:44,912
But it wasn't just luck.

185
00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:48,185
- Tell 'em.
- Haymer's Alliance.

186
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:52,524
Bio-weapons expert during the war.
He'd target neighborhoods with valuables...

187
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:55,622
wipe out every living soul
without ever damaging the goods.

188
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,099
Go in, take whatever he wanted.

189
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:01,069
Now he's livin' fat
on a private estate on Bellerophon.

190
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:03,868
[ Saffron ]
I've managed to get ahold...

191
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,101
of his schedule
for the next eighteen months...

192
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:10,078
a layout of the estate grounds
and every security code for the place.

193
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:14,743
Saffron has a notion we can walk right in there,
take the Lassiter right off his shelf.

194
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:19,983
- I'm confused--
- [ Saffron ] You're asking yourself...

195
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:23,253
if I've got the security codes,
why don't I grab it for myself?

196
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:27,285
No, actually,
I was wondering...

197
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:29,696
what's she doing on this ship?

198
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:34,430
- Didn't she try to kill us?
- Please. Nobody died last time.

199
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:36,734
We're in space.
How'd she get here?

200
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:39,707
- She hitched.
- I don't recall pulling over.

201
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:43,371
The point is this ain't
no wobbly headed doll caper.

202
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:45,175
This here's history.

203
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:48,508
Okay, I got a question.

204
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:54,421
If she's got the security codes,
why don't shejust walk in and grab it herself?.

205
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:57,526
Good point.

206
00:13:57,594 --> 00:14:01,030
Getting through the door and putting
our hands on the Lassiter, it's easy.

207
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:04,624
- Getting out with it, that's the tricky part.
- It's tagged and coded.

208
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:09,365
Second it passes through the door--
alarms, security, feds.

209
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:11,407
This isn't a one-woman operation.

210
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:13,806
- To do this right I'm gonna need--
- [ Inara ] Idiots.

211
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:18,013
- Partners.
- Dupes.

212
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:20,242
That's what you'll all be
if you trust her.

213
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,013
Could be that's so.

214
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:26,419
Lord knows, ain't none of us
here criminal masterminds.

215
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:29,822
So, if you've got something better, Inara,
something not petty...

216
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:32,225
well, we'd sure be
willing to hear it.

217
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,723
[ Chinese ]

218
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:41,779
[ Mal ]
So, the question remains--

219
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:45,871
how do we get the artifact out
without setting off the alarms?

220
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,387
- This the layout?
- [ Saffron ] Full blueprints of the entire grounds.

221
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:53,446
Could be we look hard enough
we'll find a way.

222
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:55,458
You dig into that,
little Kaylee. Zoe?

223
00:14:55,526 --> 00:14:58,461
You ain't said a word.
Time to weigh in.

224
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:03,395
Take sounds ripe enough,
assuming we can fence it.

225
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:07,301
I know a guy on Persephone--
already has half dozen buyers on the bid.

226
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,703
But Inara ain't wrong.

227
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:14,244
- She can't be trusted.
- I ain't askin' you to trust her.

228
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:17,371
- I'll be with her on the inside the whole time.
- See there?

229
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:21,509
All you gotta do to be a rich woman,
hon, is get over it.

230
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:24,418
[ Chuckles ]
Okay.

231
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:28,887
I'm in.

232
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:36,261
Captain says you're to stay put. Doesn't want
you to run afoul of his blushing psychotic bride.

233
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:40,565
She figures out who you are,
she'll turn you in before you can say...

234
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:43,539
"Don't turn me in, lady."

235
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:46,371
This bounty on us just keeps
getting more exciting.

236
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:48,912
Well, I wouldn't know.

237
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:51,277
She's a liar.

238
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:54,875
That don't exactly set her apart
from the rest of us.

239
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:57,614
The plunder sounds fun enough.

240
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,248
She's a liar,
and no good will come of her.

241
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:03,452
Well, as a rule I say
girlfolk ain't to be trusted.

242
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:08,191
- Jayne is a girl's name.
- Well,Jayne ain't a girl!

243
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:11,029
If she starts in on
that girl's name thing...

244
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:14,298
I'll show her good and all
I got man parts.

245
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:17,602
I'm trying to think of a way
for you to be cruder. I just--

246
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:20,508
It's not coming.

247
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:22,546
[ Chuckles ]

248
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:26,983
I was gonna leave you
a deck of cards.

249
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,951
Great.

250
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:33,456
[ Sighs ]
Another exciting adventure in sitting.

251
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,754
Afraid.

252
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:39,495
We'll be okay.

253
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:44,128
Why the captain is trusting that--
[ Chinese ]

254
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,226
Not her.

255
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,863
Jayne.

256
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:52,170
Afraid? Since when.

257
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:58,144
Since Ariel. Afraid we'll know.

258
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:07,686
We should be on Bellerophon by oh-six.
I figure the job should take--

259
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:11,319
- I really don't wanna know.
- At least it's your kind of world.

260
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:13,295
- Got appointments made?
- Minute we hit atmo, I'm gone.

261
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:17,767
I've booked a few clients. Should help me get
my mind off of Mal's descent into lunacy.

262
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:21,100
Zoe, don't let Mal trust her.

263
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:23,799
Everything Saffron is is a lie.

264
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:28,311
She'll get the drop on him, which, as far as
I'm concerned, is what he richly deserves.

265
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:32,543
I ain't sayin' it ain't risky.
Don't count Mal out, though.

266
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:34,379
- He just knows the estate is--
- No details.

267
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:37,614
I meant that.
Just be careful.

268
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:41,858
- See ya when we're wealthy.
- [ Chuckles ]

269
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,226
Hey, you give me
a hand in here.

270
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:49,732
No wanderin'about, remember?

271
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,564
Or I'll stick you back in your crate.

272
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:58,534
Bellerophon Estates--
home to the rich and paranoid.

273
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:03,410
Gracious living, ocean views
and state-of-the-art security...

274
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,471
including local patrols and...

275
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,881
multi-code keys needed
at all entrances and exits.

276
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:10,250
- Which we have.
- Right.

277
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:13,484
You and Mal will split off in shuttle two
as we make our approach.

278
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:21,725
There's a landing port
just south of the main house.

279
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,826
Prepare for landing.
You ready?

280
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,937
Ready.

281
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,518
[ Wash ]
Haymer's throwing a big party this weekend...

282
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:46,420
so you should have no trouble blending in
with the hired help who'll be there setting up.

283
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:51,761
All you gotta do is get
through the back door.

284
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:58,624
That shouldn't be a problem,
unless someone has been less than truthful.

285
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:01,136
- [ Beeps ]
- [ Door Unlocks ]

286
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:05,073
[ Kaylee ] The parlor with the Lassiter
is on the ninth floor.

287
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:09,044
You'll have to disable the display.
Won't be any trouble.

288
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:11,775
Once you get the goods,
you can't take it out the front door...

289
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:13,817
nor the back door,
nor any door.

290
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:16,045
Every piece of pretty
is tagged for the scanners.

291
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,588
- So what do we do?
- You wanna tell 'em?

292
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,819
It was your genius idea.

293
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:24,656
You chuck it in the garbage.

294
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:30,189
All the estates on Bellerophon use this
automated garbage drone system.

295
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:37,330
You hit one little button, and the drone
whooshes off with the trash.

296
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,782
Brilliant.

297
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:52,754
- Thanks.
- Except it's idiotic.

298
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:56,088
The drones take the disposal bins
straight to reclamation.

299
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,493
Thirty seconds after we hit the button,
the booty will be incinerated.

300
00:19:59,563 --> 00:20:04,000
Not if we reprogram the bin.
Give it new coordinates.

301
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:06,935
Once I override
the standard guidance protocol...

302
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:09,996
I can tell that disposal bin
to go wherever we want.

303
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:13,339
- And where would that be?
- The loneliest piece of desert we can find.

304
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,310
Here, Isis Canyon.

305
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:19,110
The drone dumps the bin, we claim the goods
when we're all together again.

306
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:22,516
And how do you plan to get to
the bin to reprogram it?

307
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:25,714
You get to the loot,
and we'll get to the bin.

308
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,962
[Jayne ]
All right, we're planted.

309
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,830
- Take her up.
- [ Beeping ]

310
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:14,098
That's good, that's good.
Hold her steady.

311
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:16,230
Hold her there.

312
00:21:21,912 --> 00:21:23,903
Clear.

313
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:27,950
Which way?

314
00:21:28,018 --> 00:21:30,452
- [ Beeps ]
- Right.

315
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:03,278
[ Beeping ]

316
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:07,213
This should be it.

317
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:20,393
[ Chinese ]

318
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:37,216
- Let's get to work.
- Yeah.

319
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,693
[ Beeping ]

320
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:56,633
Okay, she's set.

321
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:00,066
Be careful. It's hot.

322
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:07,006
Gorrammit, Wash!
Hold it steady!

323
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:09,075
Sorry.

324
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,057
Jayne, the dyna-ram's live.

325
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:15,989
What?

326
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:18,653

on a floaty island of your own for a while.

496
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,125
You won't tell anyone
about me breaking down.

497
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,036
I won't.

498
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:29,270
Then I won't tell anyone how easily
I got your gun out of your holster.

499
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:37,308
I'll take that as a kindness.

500
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:41,287
You just may be the most
gullible fool I ever marked.

501
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:44,290
And that makes you special.

502
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,691
Well, you can riddle me
with holes, Yolanda...

503
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:51,323
but that won't make what
I just saw anything but truth.

504
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:56,393
- I played you from minute one.
- You got me at barrel's end. Who am I to argue?

505
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:59,338
- What's your move?
- We'll be setting down in the desert...

506
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,342
leave you to set a spell.

507
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,311
Oh, and speaking of naked.

508
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:08,507
No, now that's just low.

509
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,813
Kind of evens things out though,

I really don't see the benefit to this.
I mean, however I may slip...

00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,765
you're not gonna catch my crew
with their trousers down.

you're not gonna catch my crew
with their trousers down.

516
00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:33,434
Can't turn. Not getting
any tug from the aft alternator.

517
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:37,069
That don't make no sense.
Unless--

Yep.

- The filament on the grav-dampener's stripped.
- Who could have done that?

520
00:36:55,229 --> 00:36:58,858
I can fix it, but she must have put a timer
on the motivator and wet-wired the--

00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:01,800
What does it mean, Kaylee?

522
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:04,463
We ain't gonna make the rendezvous.
We have to land-- Now.

Where is it? Oh, it's not here!

528

00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,599
- I wonder if it works.

Oh, well, it's still worth a fortune.
Anyway, this works fine.

Honey, you look horrific.

533
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:49,349
What are you doing here?

534
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:52,386
- Oh,just my part of the job.
- What part of the job?

535
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:56,014
You know, I put on the big act,
storm away in a huff.

536
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:59,355
Then I fly off, wait for you to double-cross Mal,
beat you to the rendezvous spot...

537
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:01,759
and grab the loot
before you can get to it.

What? You didn't
see it coming?

539
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:08,265
Uh-uh. You know,
I'm a little disappointed.

540
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:11,794
Some of the crew's performances weren't quite
as nuanced as they could have been.

541
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,931
I thought they tipped the fact
we were playing you...

542
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:16,943
from the second Mal
took you out of that crate.

Oh, well. Guess not.

in a few hours to dig you out.

- You got knocked out.
- Huh?

00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:51,277
Did we get a payoff?
Did we get the money?

Do you wanna know why?

555
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:08,858
Your spine. You hit it
pretty hard when you fell.

Oh. 'Pine?

557
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:15,533
Yes. So I gave you something to knock out
your motor functions...

558
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,595
so you wouldn't wrench it
when you came to.

559

to sell out me and River on Ariel?

or trust each other...

we're on the same crew.

and more than enough of both.
