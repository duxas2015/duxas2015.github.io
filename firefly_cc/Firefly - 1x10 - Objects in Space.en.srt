- No.

The more I see, the more I think
their purpose was very specific.

23

And look at this, the pattern.

Follow me.

498
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:32,868
[Jayne ] Get behind us, Preacher.
We need cover.

499
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:36,705
Don't think,just shoot.

500
00:37:57,665 --> 00:38:00,133
Can't look. Can't look.

501
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:19,112
No power in the 'verse can stop me.

502
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,338
[ Choking ]

503
00:38:50,117 --> 00:38:53,780
Haven't you killed me
enough for one day?

504
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:06,931
Jayne.

505
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:09,492
This is something the captain
has to do for himself.

506
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,868
- [ Mal ] No. No, it's not.
- Oh.

507
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:38,321
You sure this thing's
gonna stay on?

508
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:40,629
Well, this dermal mender creates
an excellent tissue bond.

509
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:43,363
It should be fine.Just don't--
don't fiddle with it.

510
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:47,703
Be sure to, uh,
thank the counselor for me.

511
00:39:47,775 --> 00:39:51,233
Awful nice for her to pull some
strings and lend us this equipment.

512
00:39:51,312 --> 00:39:53,303
It's the least she could do.

513
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,314
I just wish you had
killed that old bastard.

514
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:58,840
I got regrets on
that score my own self.

515
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:03,288
So, I hear y'all took up arms in that
little piece of action back there.

516
00:40:06,861 --> 00:40:09,523
How you faring with that, Doctor?

517
00:40:09,597 --> 00:40:13,226
[ Inhales ] I don't know.
I never shot anyone before.

518
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,360
I was there, son.

519
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:18,928
I'm fair sure
you haven't shot anyone yet.

520
00:40:19,006 --> 00:40:21,702
[ Chuckling ]
Ow.

521
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:03,750
Mmm. Wife soup.
I must have done good.

522
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:07,948
Yes, dear.
You done good.

523
00:41:08,022 --> 00:41:10,957
Ow.
[ Sighs ]

524
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:14,085
- Did you tell her?
- Tell her what?

525
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:16,629
Your husband has demanded
that we sleep together.

526
00:41:16,697 --> 00:41:20,463
- Really?
- What? Mal, come on.

527
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:24,334
He seems to think it would get all this
burning sexual tension out in the open.

528
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:27,863
- You know, make a fair fight
for your womanly affections.
- No.

529
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:31,605
That was the torture talking.
Remember the torture?

530
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:36,946
I know it's a difficult mission,
but you and I...

531
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:39,349
have to get it on.

532
00:41:41,021 --> 00:41:43,319
I understand.
We have no choice.

533
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:49,892
- Take me, sir. Take me hard.
- Now something about that
is just downright unsettling.

534
00:41:49,964 --> 00:41:52,194
[ Clattering ]

535
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:58,433
We'll be in our bunk.

536
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:08,876
Oh, hey. Free soup.

537
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,355
Grr! Arrgh!
