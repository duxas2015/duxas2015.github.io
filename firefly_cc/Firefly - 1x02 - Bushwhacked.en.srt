Thank God you stopped them.

505
00:33:46,997 --> 00:33:50,023
Did you honestly think you could access
my accounts and I wouldn't find you?

506
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,036
And, Zoe, what would your husband say
if he knew you were here?

507
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:57,764
I-- I was weak.

508
00:33:57,841 --> 00:34:00,742
So I take it
they ain't newlyweds.

509
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:02,745
[ Scoffs ]
Hardly.

510
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:07,216
Malcolm's my indentured man
with three years left in his debt.

511
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:11,448
I imagine we'll have to add another
six months after this little adventure.

512
00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:15,515
[ Murmuring ]

513
00:34:15,593 --> 00:34:20,292
Pardon them. Don't think a one of'em's
ever seen a registered Companion before.

514
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:22,195
I apologize for my manner.

515
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:24,791
- [ Sheriff] Not a bit.
- Should I contact my ship?

516
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:26,927
Do you need to hold them
very much longer?

517
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:29,097
Looks to me like
we're about done here.

518
00:34:29,173 --> 00:34:31,698
We had some, uh,
unrelated trouble.

519
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:34,676
- His story had kind of an odor to it.
- Yes.

520
00:34:34,745 --> 00:34:37,179
It's not the only thing
about him that does.

521
00:34:38,882 --> 00:34:40,816
Thank you very much, Sheriff.

522
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:45,311
Come along.

523
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,497
That's a hell of a lady.

524
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:01,834
- [ Door Closes ]
- Her files were all in order?

525
00:35:01,905 --> 00:35:03,896
I ran 'em twice.

526
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,735
Huh. Let's get started
with the rest then.

527
00:35:18,022 --> 00:35:20,183
Hey. How'd it go?

528
00:35:20,257 --> 00:35:22,248
She hit me.

529
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,093
We tried to get him into the infirmary.
He's just heavy.

530
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:33,534
- Kept the engine running. We're good to go.
- We're not going.

531
00:35:33,604 --> 00:35:35,595
Not-- What?
Not-- Why?

532
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:38,198
- We're bringing the cargo back.
- What?

533
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:41,642
What do you mean, "back"?
I waited for you guys!

534
00:35:41,712 --> 00:35:44,442
[ Wash ] What are you talking about?
What about Niska?

535
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:46,847
Won't this put him
in more or less a killing mood?

536
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:48,976
There's others need this more.

537
00:35:49,053 --> 00:35:51,021
- Let's get it on the mule.
- My shuttle's faster.

538
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:54,353
You risked enough flying in there once.
And I don't want to get slapped no more.

539
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:56,484
Far as Niska goes,
we'll explain to him...

540
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,358
the job went south
when we return the money.

541
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,625
You wanna explain,
now's your chance.

542
00:36:18,415 --> 00:36:20,713
You didn't make
the rendezvous.

543
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:23,344
Ran into a few complications.

544
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,014
You are thinking of taking
Mr. Niska's money...

545
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,058
and his property maybe.

546
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:31,856
- Uh, interestingly, neither.
- I don't understand.

547
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:34,489
Yeah. Look.
Here's what it is. Deal's off.

548
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,528
We changed our minds.

549
00:36:38,602 --> 00:36:42,385
You entered into an arrangement
with Mr. Niska.

550
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:45,750
- There is no mind changing.
- I'm afraid that's where you're wrong.

551
00:36:45,822 --> 00:36:48,347
We-- We just--

552
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:51,154
We can't take this job.
So you just relax.

553
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:54,663
We'll get you the money Niska gave us,
you return it, and we'll call it even.

554
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:56,892
There is no even.

555
00:36:57,967 --> 00:36:59,730
Is that right?

556
00:37:45,114 --> 00:37:48,641
-[ Gunshot ]
- [ Groaning ]

557
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:56,748
Nice shot.

558
00:37:56,826 --> 00:37:58,817
I was aimin' for his head.

559
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,771
We'll have to
drag 'em from here.

560
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,412
We can leave 'em
just off the street.

561
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:21,416
Notify the sheriff
once we're in deep, deep space.

562
00:38:21,484 --> 00:38:23,475
Why not tell him in person?

563
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:28,814
[ Sheriff]
Got word of a ship not far out.

564
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,724
Came lookin'.

565
00:38:34,764 --> 00:38:37,232
Didn't expect to find you
comin' back.

566
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,666
Didn't expect to be comin'.

567
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:41,761
Nothin' missin'.

568
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:52,846
You were truthful back in town.
These are tough times.

569
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:55,406
A man can get a job.

570
00:38:55,485 --> 00:38:58,886
He might not look too close
at what that job is.

571
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:04,324
But a man learns all the details
of a situation like ours...

572
00:39:04,394 --> 00:39:08,262
well... then he has a choice.

573
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:11,592
I don't believe he does.

574
00:39:17,473 --> 00:39:21,034
Let's get these crates back to town,
make ourselves useful.

575
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:42,392
- [ Engines Starting ]
- Now, this is all the money
Niska gave us in advance.

576
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:45,400
- You bring it back to him.
Tell him the job didn't work out.
- [ Spits ]

577
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:48,869
We're not thieves.
But we are thieves.

578
00:39:48,938 --> 00:39:51,270
Point is,
we're not taking what's his.

579
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:54,435
We'll stay out of his way
as best we can from here on in.

580
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,808
You explain that's best
for everyone. Okay?

581
00:40:01,184 --> 00:40:04,244
Keep the money.
Use it to buy a funeral.

582
00:40:05,755 --> 00:40:10,124
It doesn't matter where you go
or how far you fly.

583
00:40:10,193 --> 00:40:14,926
I will hunt you down, and the
last thing you see will be my blade.

584
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:18,466
Darn.

585
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:27,475
- This is all the money Niska gave us--
- I get it. I'm good.

586
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:30,569
Best thing for everyone.
I'm right there with you.

587
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:44,383
You should've let me
do this sooner.

588
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,987
I've had plenty worse.
It's just-- Ow!

589
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:50,055
- Sorry.
-Just be careful.

590
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,027
Pretty fast thinkin',
dopin' up Jayne.

591
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,472
Can't say you made
a lifetime friend.

592
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,474
I'll deal with him.

593
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,533
Yeah, I'm not
too worried about you.

594
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:06,215
- How's your sister?
- The same.

595
00:41:06,282 --> 00:41:09,217
One moment she seems
perfectly cogent, the next...

596
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:12,977
she speaks nonsense.

597
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:16,081
[ Simon ]
It's like a child.

598
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,026
- So difficult to diagnose.
- [ River ] Two by two.

599
00:41:19,095 --> 00:41:21,825
I still don't know what the government
was trying to do with her.

600
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:25,265
- Hands of blue.
- So I have no idea if they succeeded.

601
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:27,461
Two by two.

602
00:41:28,771 --> 00:41:31,831
Hands of blue.

603
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:34,376
Two by two.

604
00:41:34,444 --> 00:41:37,004
Hands of blue.

605
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:40,742
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
There's always one crisis--
- We're not interested.

606
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:43,047
We're here about a theft.

607
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,054
The medicine.
On that planet.

608
00:41:46,122 --> 00:41:48,283
- Word came up that was returned.
- We didn't fly...

609
00:41:48,357 --> 00:41:52,088
86 million miles to track down
a box of Band-Aids, Colonel.

610
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:54,925
We're looking for a girl.

611
00:41:54,997 --> 00:41:56,988
This girl.

612
00:42:36,372 --> 00:42:38,306
