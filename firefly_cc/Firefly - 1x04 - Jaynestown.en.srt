1
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:14,501
Didn't hardly have to convert
the ship, even.

2
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:16,701
Six in the corner.

3
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:20,177
Stronger locks, thicker doors. Keep
everybody where they're supposed to be.

4
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:22,180
Don't even need
more rations.

5
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:24,079
- [ Man ] Hey.
- [ Men Groaning ]

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,243
- Wait.
- Come on!

7
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:31,790
[ Moans ]

8
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,761
[ Groaning ]

9
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,992
- You made money, huh?
- Hand over fist, my friend.

10
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:44,526
Water planets need labor. Terra-forming
crews got a prodigious death rate.

11
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:47,334
Labor?
You mean, uh, slaves.

12
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:51,709
Well, they wasn't volunteers,
for damn sure.

13
00:00:51,777 --> 00:00:55,372
That why you didn't have
to lay in more rations?

14
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:58,946
I didn't hear
no complaints.

15
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,486
[Jayne ]
How much money? Lots?

16
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,855
There's, uh, a chance you might
wanna head back to the ship.

17
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:09,656
I'm all right.
This is entertaining, actually.

18
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:12,823
- Yeah? What's entertaining?
- I like watching the game.

19
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:15,925
Plus the other situations.
The key seems to be...

20
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:19,631
- giving Jayne a heavy stick and standing back.
- Ha!

21
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:23,163
Still, might ought to clear out
before too much longer.

22
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:25,233
- Seems there's a thief about.
- Thief?

23
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:27,836
Yeah.
Took this right off him.

24
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:30,246
Now, they earned that with the sweat
of their slave-trading brows.

25
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:33,581
- Mal.
- Oh, terrible shame.

26
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:36,588
'Course, they won't discover it till
they go order their next round of drinks.

27
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:38,715
- Wei.
- Good drinker, that one.

28
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:08,882
Lovely place.
I'll tell my friends.

29
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:17,592
~ Take my love, take my land ~

30
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:21,030
~ Take me where
I cannot stand ~

31
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,796
~I don't care, I'm still free ~

32
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:28,033
~ You can't take the sky
from me ~

33
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:30,837
~ Take me out to the black ~

34
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,368
~ Tell them
I ain't comin'back ~

35
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:37,177
~ Burn the land
and boil the sea ~

36
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:40,844
~ You can't take the sky
from me ~

37
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:52,591
~ There's no place I can be ~

38
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:56,032
~ Since I've found serenity ~

39
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:59,936
~ But you can't
take the sky from me ~~

40
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:14,409
Seem to you we cleared out
of Santho in a hurry?

41
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,421
Seems to me
we do that a lot.

42
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,754
Heard tell, though,
we're gonna stay a while on Persephone.

43
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,225
- Shiny.
- Yeah?

44
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:24,262
Thought you get land crazy
that long in port.

45
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,790
Probably, but I've been sane
a long while now, and change is good.

46
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:33,100
Well, ain't that
a joyful sight.

47
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,663
- You gotta love a sunset.
- Startin' to get familiar too.

48
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,834
- Like a second home.
- Persephone ain't home.

49
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,209
Too many people we need to avoid.
Resupply...

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,441
look for work, move along.

51
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,450
We sniff the air.
We don't kiss the dirt.

52
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:48,009
Wasn't planning on
the dirt kissing, sir.

53
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:51,716
I wouldn't stand for it anyway, Captain,
jealous man like me.

54
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,884
- [ Beeping ]
- Closing in.

55
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,893
[ Zoe ]
Planet's coming up a might fast.

56
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,987
That's just 'cause
I'm goin' down too quick.

57
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:01,158
Likely crash and kill us all.

58
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:05,067
- Well, if that happens, let me know.
- Okay.

59
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:08,163
- Whoa! No, we're good.
- [ Rumbling ]

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,367
We're good. It's okay.

61
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,347
I understand your time
on our planet is limited...

62
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:27,290
and if you selected
my proposal to hear...

63
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:33,195
then the honor you do me
flatters my-- my honor.

64
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:35,995
And I hope--

65
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,502
Now there's the smile
made of sunlight.

66
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:41,233
Atherton.
How wonderful to see you.

67
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:44,367
Did you get my message?
I was extra appealing.

68
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:47,173
What a flattering invitation.
I had no idea I was arriving in time...

69
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,578
for the social event of the season.

70
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:53,675
So, you'll accompany me?
I ask, heart in my throat.

71
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,915
There's a certain offer
I'm still waiting to hear about.

72
00:04:56,989 --> 00:05:00,152
- [ Knocking ]
- Yes, I imagine there is.

73
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:02,854
I'm delighted to say I'll be there.

74
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:06,364
- Now, I'm sorry, Atherton. I have to run.
- No, please. I understand.

75
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,696
I'll see you soon, baobei.

76
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,697
- Good afternoon, Captain.
- Morning.

77
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,706
We're downing in case
Wash don't kill us all.

78
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,969
Local time's gonna be in the a.m.,
10:00 or so.

79
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:19,533
Yes, I saw that.

80
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,747
Making plans?
Atherton Wing.

81
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:26,182
Now, he's a regular, ain't he?

82
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,317
- I've seen him before.
- Oh, I never did.

83
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,950
Not what I pictured. Young.

84
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:36,153
Must be rich too
to afford your rates.

85
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:39,425
I suppose.
He has engaged me for several days.

86
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:42,899
Days? One must have stamina.

87
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,801
Mmm. He does.

88
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,065
Well, fine.

89
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,236
Is he lettin'you out at all?

90
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,246
Actually, we're attending
a ball tomorrow night.

91
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,612
Tell me, do all the men there
pay for their dates...

92
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,617
or just young rich ones with stamina?

93
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:02,279
Most of the women there
will not be Companions...

94
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:04,322
if that's what you're asking.

95
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,324
Perhaps the other men
couldn't attract one.

96
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:08,553
Hmm. It sounds like...

97
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:11,323
the finest party I could imagine
gettin' paid to go to.

98
00:06:11,397 --> 00:06:15,800
I don't suppose you'd find it up
to the standards of your outings.

99
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:19,804
More conversation and somewhat less petty
theft and getting hit with pool cues.

100
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:22,807
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]

101
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,866
I understand if you need
to go prepare...

102
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:27,435
for that
''It's 10:00 in the morning'' issue.

103
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,277
Yeah. Better go do that.

104
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,182
'Cause I think this is more
of, uh, an evening look.

105
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:59,005
Ooh. Look at the pretties!

106
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:01,137
What am I looking at,
the girls or the clothes?

107
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,147
- [Jayne ] The girls.
- The clothes, please.

108
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:08,686
Say, look at the fluffy one.

109

[ Zoe ]
Too much foofaraw.

110
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:13,484
If I'm gonna wear a dress,
I want something with some slink.

111
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,857
You want a slinky dress?
I can buy you a slinky dress.

112
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:18,055
Captain, can I have money
for a slinky dress?

113
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,564
- I'll chip in.
- I can hurt you.

114
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:24,228
The only place I seen something so nice
is some of the things Inara has.

115
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:26,863
Well, we'd best be movin'.

116
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:29,430
I guess she needs all that stuff,
the life she leads.

117
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:34,377
Well, sure. Sometimes the customers buy
her things. You know, some real rich men.

118
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:36,710
Come on. These ain't feathers
I'm totin' here, you know.

119
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:40,718
I like the ruffles.
Inara gets to wear whatever she wants.

120
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:43,448
What are you gonna do
in that rig?

121
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:46,218
Waltz around the engine room?
Be like a sheep walkin' on its hind legs.

122
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:48,226
[Jayne Laughs ]

123
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,703
See you on the ship, Captain.

124
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:03,241
Ohh.

125
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:09,513
What, is she mad or something?

126

- Badger.
- Captain Reynolds.

128
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:33,627
Heard you was in town. Thought
we might have a bit of a sit-down.

129
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:36,675
Prefer a bit of a "piss off."

130
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:39,836
I'm very sorry. Did I give you
the impression I was askin'?

131
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,418
Seems to me the last time there was
a chance for a little palaver...

132
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,754
we were all manner of unwelcome.

133
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:58,354
This ain't bad.

134
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,660
There's a trick to it.
Wood alcohol.

135
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:03,566
Now we're favored guests...

137
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:09,306
So what is it you need?

138
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,277
- Here. Excuse me.
- There's a local...

by the name of Warrick Harrow.

140
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:19,941
Got some property he wants
to sell off-planet. Fetch a high price.

141
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,111
The local powers
won't let him sell off-world.

142
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,588
It's a conundrum. What my man
Harrow needs himself is a smuggler.

143
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:28,524
- Willin' to cut you in on it.
- Why me?

144
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:31,324
You have access to ships.
You could do it yourself.

145

Don't find me respectable.
But you--

You, I figure, got a chance.

151
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,305
You backed out of a deal last time,
left us hangin'.

152
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,181
- Hurt our feelings.
- You recall why that took place?

with your attitude is why.

154
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:59,156
Felt you was--
What's the word?

155
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,557
- Pretentious?
- Exactly.

156
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:04,823
You think you're better
than other people.

157
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,831
Just the ones I'm better than.

158
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,833
And now I'm thinkin'
that very quality...

159
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,493
is the one you're
placing value on today.

160
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,629
I place value on the fact
that stick up your pigu...

161
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:15,730
is about as large
as the one that Harrow's got.

How would you even set up a meet?
The man won't deal with you.

Know a place he'll be.
Safe place.

High class too. Won't let me in there.

he's a psychotic lowlife.

- Why are you here?
- Business. Same as you.

335
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,833
I was talking to a contact about a
smuggling job, and you came over to me.

336
00:23:09,903 --> 00:23:12,565
- You were staring at me.
- I saw you is all.

You stand out.

338
00:23:18,412 --> 00:23:21,142
In this company, Captain,
I believe you're the one who stands out.

339
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:23,580
Well, maybe I just want
to see a professional at work.

340
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,709
Is this the hardest part,
or does that come later?

341
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:28,220
You have no call trying
to make me ashamed of my job.

342
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:30,882
What I do is legal.
And how's that smuggling coming?

343
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:35,220
- My work's illegal, but at least it's honest.
- What?

344
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:37,229
Well, this-- the lie of it.

- I like Atherton too, by the way.
- Well, sure.

I'm liable to sleep with him myself.

And he likes me
whether you see it or not.

- Of course.
- He's made me an offer.

00:23:58,351 --> 00:24:02,117
You may think he doesn't honor me,
but he wants me to live here.

00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:05,090
I'd be his personal Companion.
I could belong here.

that layer cake she's wearing.

Yeah, but I never said it.

No need for hands on.

Excuse me. She's not here with you,

Well, that's fine.

He collected

- I'm not rightly sure. What's going on?

Well, first off, you'll be put up in lodgings
for the night, so you don't disappear.

I wouldn't blame you, incidentally.

Wing may be a spoiled dandy,
but he's an expert swordsman.

does this mean we're in business?

It means you're in mortal danger.

00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:48,010
But you mussed up Atherton's face, and
that has endeared you to me somewhat.

The captain's a good fighter.
He must know how to handle a sword.

which end to hold.

00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:50,049
We're fragile creatures.

495
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:53,245
It takes less than a pound
of pressure to cut skin.

496
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:56,848
You know that?
They teach you that in whore academy?

497
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:02,355
You have a strange sense
of nobility, Captain.

498
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:06,594
You'll lay a man out for implying I'm a whore,
but you keep calling me one to my face.

499
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:10,103
I might not show respect
to your job, but he didn't respect you.

500
00:34:10,171 --> 00:34:12,071
That's the difference.

501
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,902
Inara, he doesn't even see you.

502
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:17,069
Well, I guess death will solve
the issue to everyone's satisfaction.

503
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:21,376
This [ Chinese ] duel is the result
of the rules of your society, not mine.

504
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:25,408
You are always breaking the rules,
no matter what society you're in.

505
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:27,420
You don't get along
with ordinary criminals either...

506
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:29,422
which is why you are constantly
getting in trouble.

507
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:31,515
You think following the rules
will buy you a nice life...

508
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:33,526
even if the rules make you a slave.

509
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:37,690
Don't take his offer.

510
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:39,858
What?

511
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:42,232
Don't do it.

512
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:45,431
Just in the case that it happens,
that means that he's the fellow who killed me...

513
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:47,701
and I don't like fellows
who kill me, not in general.

514
00:34:51,712 --> 00:34:55,546
I said before that I didn't have call
to stop you, and that's true.

515
00:34:57,518 --> 00:34:59,452
Anyways, don't.

516
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:07,760
I need to get back.

517
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:13,594
He'll be up early.

518
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:17,195
Right. He's got that big day.

519
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:17,387
Best be careful, Ath.
You know, these things are sharp.

520
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:20,628
- He thinks he's doing well, doesn't he?
- He's being toyed with.

521
00:36:44,258 --> 00:36:46,749
- What's he doing?
- Don't fall for that!

522
00:36:51,298 --> 00:36:55,758
Well, this isn't going
to take long, is it?

523
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:22,555
We're coming up on the end, miss.
You might not want to watch.

524
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:34,365
Atherton, wait!

525
00:37:34,442 --> 00:37:37,741
I'll stay here, exclusive to you.
Just let him live.

526
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:53,821
[ Man ]
He's down.

527
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,654
You have to finish it, lad.

528
00:38:02,203 --> 00:38:05,104
You have to finish it.

529
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:10,474
For a man to lay beaten and yet
breathing, it makes him a coward.

530
00:38:10,544 --> 00:38:13,604
- It's humiliation.
- Sure.

531
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:16,241
It would be humiliating...

532
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:20,845
having to lie there while the better man
refuses to spill your blood.

533
00:38:20,921 --> 00:38:24,652
Mercy is the mark of a great man.

534
00:38:24,725 --> 00:38:27,853
- [ Groans ]
- Guess I'm just a good man.

535
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:31,420
- [ Groans ]
- Well, I'm all right.

536
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:33,433
- [ Drops Sword ]
- [ Groaning ]

537
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,071
Inara? Inara!

538
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:45,441
You've lost her, lad.
Be gracious.

539
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:48,277
You set this up, whore...

540
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:51,443
after I bought and paid for you.

541
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,682
I should've uglied you up,
so no one else would want you.

542
00:38:56,156 --> 00:38:59,523
See how I'm not punching him?
I think I've grown.

543
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:03,051
Well, get ready to starve.

544
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,462
I'll see to it
you never work again.

545
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:08,468
Actually, that's not how it works.

546
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:12,131
You see, you've earned yourself
a black mark in the client registry.

547
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:15,573
No Companion is going
to contract with you ever again.

548
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:21,081
You'll have to rely on your winning
personality to get women. God help you.

549
00:39:24,818 --> 00:39:28,618
[ Groans ]
Ow, ow.

550
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:30,623
You didn't have
to wound that man.

551
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:33,888
Yeah, I know.
It was just funny.

552
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:36,657
You willing to fight that hard
to protect my property...

553
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,494
I'll have it in your hold
before midnight.

554
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:49,408
Mighty fine shindig.

555
00:39:58,419 --> 00:40:01,752
Doc's filling the shepherd in
on the plan.

556
00:40:01,822 --> 00:40:03,756
We're ready to move on your signal.

557
00:40:03,824 --> 00:40:07,123
Doc is the diversion.

558
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:11,460
Did you ever see such a lazy crew?

559
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:14,695
- Captain!
- You're hurt.

560
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:22,904
- You get us a deal?
- I got a deal. Now get off my ship.

561
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:25,343
So, very much for
a lovely night then.

562
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:28,781
[ Whistles ]

563
00:40:32,786 --> 00:40:35,721
- Ow!
- Are you badly hurt?

564
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:37,279
[ Groans ]

565
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:40,418
We was just about
to spring into action, Captain.

566
00:40:40,494 --> 00:40:42,223
Complicated escape and rescue op.

567
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:45,788
I was gonna watch.
It was very exciting.

568
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:52,538
~~ [ Humming ]

569
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,763
~~ [ Classical ]

570
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:44,317
Thank you for the wine.
It's... very fresh.

571
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:48,088
To Kaylee and her inter-engine
fermentation system.

572
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:51,829
- Are you in pain?
- Absolutely.

573
00:41:51,899 --> 00:41:54,629
- I got stabbed, you know, right here.
- I saw.

574
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:57,865
Don't care much for fancy parties.

575
00:41:57,938 --> 00:42:01,567
- Too rough.
- It wasn't entirely a disaster.

576
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:05,578
- I got stabbed, right here.
- You also lined up exciting new crime.

577
00:42:07,314 --> 00:42:10,044
It's good to have cargo.

578
00:42:10,117 --> 00:42:12,381
Makes us a target for every other
scavenger out there, of course...

579
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:16,583
- but sometimes that's fun too.
- [ Chuckles ]

580
00:42:20,494 --> 00:42:23,156
I am grateful, you know,
for the ill-conceived...

581
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,597
and highhanded attempt to defend
my honor, although I didn't want you to.

582
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:31,203
Gracious as that is...

583
00:42:31,271 --> 00:42:35,002
as I look back... I probably should've
stayed out of your world.

584
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:38,909
My world?
If it is that.

585
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:41,140
I wasn't gonna stay, you know.

586
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:46,846
Yeah? Why's that?

587
00:42:48,355 --> 00:42:51,347
Oh, someone needs to keep
Kaylee out of trouble.

588
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:53,689
And all my things are here.

589
00:42:56,797 --> 00:43:00,756
Besides, why would I want
to leave serenity?

590
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:05,197
Can't think of a reason.

591
00:43:05,272 --> 00:43:08,366
[ Lowing ]

592
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:54,186
