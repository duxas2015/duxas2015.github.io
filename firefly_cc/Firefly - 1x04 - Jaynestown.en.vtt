- Hand over fist, my friend.

Water planets need labor. Terra-forming
crews got a prodigious death rate.

You mean, uh, slaves.

Well, they wasn't volunteers,
for damn sure.

wanna head back to the ship.

This is entertaining, actually.

- Yeah? What's entertaining?
- I like watching the game.

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.925
Plus the other situations.
The key seems to be...

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:19.631
- giving Jayne a heavy stick and standing back.
- Ha!

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:23.163
Still, might ought to clear out

A life...

00:12:58.503 --> 00:13:00.562

00:13:02.374 --> 00:13:06.242
You can live here on Persephone
as my personal Companion.

00:13:09.314 --> 00:13:11.248
You're a generous man.

00:13:12.317 --> 00:13:14.877
That is not a yes.

00:13:14.953 --> 00:13:18.013
It's not a no either.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.752
You look gorgeous, dear.

00:13:25.163 --> 00:13:29.327
You belong here, Inara,
not on a flying piece of go-se.

00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:32.393
- You see that, don't you?
- Atherton, language.

00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:34.439
What? Piece of go-se?

00:13:34.506 --> 00:13:36.838
But it is a piece of go-se.

00:13:36.908 --> 00:13:41.538

Miss Kaywinnit Lee Frye and escort.

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.547

00:13:55.216 --> 00:13:57.650
Oh, go-se.

00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:38.189
[ Mal ] Does, um--
Does this seem kind of tight?

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:40.523
It shows off your backside.

00:14:40.594 --> 00:14:42.721
Did you see the chandelier?
It's hovering.

00:14:42.796 --> 00:14:45.993
- What's the point of that, I wonder?
- Oh, mangos!

00:14:46.066 --> 00:14:48.534
[ Mal ] I see how they did it.
I just ain't gettin'the why.

These girls have
the most beautiful dresses.

00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:54.303
- And so do I. How about that?
- Yeah, well,just be careful.

00:14:54.375 --> 00:14:56.673
We cheated Badger out of
good money to buy that frippery...

00:14:56.744 --> 00:14:58.712
and you're supposed to
make me look respectable.

Yes, sir,
Captain Tight-pants.

00:15:01.215 --> 00:15:03.410
Okay. I'm lookin'
for our guy Harrow.

00:15:03.484 --> 00:15:06.510
And Inara. We should look for her, right?
Just to say hello at her.

00:15:06.587 --> 00:15:10.683
Well, if we see her.
I think she's wearing gold.

00:15:10.758 --> 00:15:15.218
Okay, help me find our man. He's
supposed to be older, kind of stocky.

00:15:15.296 --> 00:15:17.924
- Wears a red sash crossways.
- Why does he do that?

00:15:17.998 --> 00:15:20.796
Maybe he won the Miss Persephone
pageant.Just help me look.

00:15:20.868 --> 00:15:23.837
Is that him?

00:15:23.904 --> 00:15:25.895
That's the buffet table.

00:15:25.973 --> 00:15:30.433
Well, how can we be sure
unless we question it?

00:15:30.511 --> 00:15:33.708
Fine. Don't make yourself sick.

Tall card. Plum.

Plums are tall.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.614
I'll take two.

Two.

00:16:13.454 --> 00:16:17.720
- No tall card claim.
- Speakin' of garbage, I'll take three.

00:16:17.791 --> 00:16:21.659
Three. Dealer forced
to claim the tall.

00:16:27.634 --> 00:16:30.899
What do you suppose the captain
and Kaylee are doing now?

- I fold.
- [ Simon ] Me too.

- Tall cards 'round my neck like a weight.
- Take it, Shepherd.

00:16:42.383 --> 00:16:44.977
Ah, that's a nice pile of things
I don't have to do.

00:16:45.052 --> 00:16:48.488
It's the ones that'll take you.

00:16:48.555 --> 00:16:53.083
They're the ones reaching and doing it.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.652
- They're the ones keeping you--
- River?
- Is she hurt?

00:16:59.099 --> 00:17:02.830
You'd better see to her.
That's a bad habit for a fugitive.

00:17:02.903 --> 00:17:06.532
- Calm down.
- Do that in public, get herself hauled off.

00:17:06.607 --> 00:17:08.541
- They're everywhere.
- Calm down.

- Hands go everywhere and [ Babbling ]--
- It's okay. Shh.

00:17:12.012 --> 00:17:17.348
She didn't harm much.
We'll have a few mystery meals.

- Sometimes... afraid.
- It's okay.

It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

00:17:23.524 --> 00:17:25.492
And they come.

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:29.620

00:17:41.809 --> 00:17:45.301
I thought you wanted to spend
more time off-ship this visit.

00:17:45.379 --> 00:17:47.313
Ohh.

Out there it seems like
it's all fancy parties.

- Mmm.
- I like our party better.

00:17:54.621 --> 00:17:57.215

and I know all the steps.

I'd say you do at that.

00:18:02.629 --> 00:18:04.927
Oh.

- Mmm.
- Don't fall asleep now.

00:18:07.668 --> 00:18:10.364
Sleepiness is weakness of character.
Ask anyone.

- It is not.
- You are acting captain.

00:18:13.841 --> 00:18:15.934
Know what happens
if you fall asleep now?

Jayne slits my throat
and takes over.

- That's right.
- And we can't stop it.

Well, I wash my hands of it.

00:18:28.188 --> 00:18:30.679
It's a hopeless case.

00:18:30.757 --> 00:18:34.420
I'll read a nice poem at the funeral,
something with imagery.

00:18:34.495 --> 00:18:39.933
You could lock the door and keep
the power-hungry maniac at bay.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.468
I don't know. I'm starting
to like this poetry idea now.

of wrapping paper blowing around.

some kind of hot cheese over there.

the ruffles, I just couldn't resist.

The sash?

00:21:06.913 --> 00:21:08.676
It indicates lord-hood.

You're mistaken, sir.
I'm an honest man.

there's nothing dishonest...

to people what need 'em.

00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:41.580

- Don't waste my time.
- Fellow called Badger.

00:21:48.488 --> 00:21:52.390
I know him, and I think
he's a psychotic lowlife.

00:21:52.459 --> 00:21:56.259
And I think calling him that is an insult
to the psychotic lowlife community.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.355
But the deal is solid.

00:21:58.432 --> 00:22:02.163

realize you were going to this party.

She made a point of your generosity.

Given that, I'm sure you won't mind
if I ask Inara the favor of a dance?

00:22:37.437 --> 00:22:39.997
Of course.

- Why are you here?
- Business. Same as you.

I was talking to a contact about a
smuggling job, and you came over to me.

In this company, Captain,
I believe you're the one who stands out.

Well, maybe I just want
to see a professional at work.

Is this the hardest part,
or does that come later?

00:23:25.786 --> 00:23:28.220
You have no call trying
to make me ashamed of my job.

What I do is legal.
And how's that smuggling coming?

- What?

- Of course.
- He's made me an offer.

00:25:21.968 --> 00:25:24.801
Money changed hands,
which makes her mine tonight.

00:25:24.871 --> 00:25:26.998
And no matter how you dress her up,
she's still--

00:25:31.845 --> 00:25:34.279
- Turns out this is my kind of party.
- Oh, Mal.

00:25:34.347 --> 00:25:36.542
What? The man was out of line.

00:25:36.616 --> 00:25:39.608
- I accept.
- That's great. What?

00:25:39.686 --> 00:25:43.349
- There has been a challenge.
- I hope you're prepared, Captain.

00:25:43.423 --> 00:25:46.221
What, you all talkin' about a fight?
Well, that's fine.

00:25:46.293 --> 00:25:48.557
- Let's get out of here.
- It's not a fistfight, Mal.

00:25:48.628 --> 00:25:51.461
The duel will be met
tomorrow morning at Kaytree Pond.

00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:53.522
Well, why wait?
Where's that guard?

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.034
He collected
a whole mess of pistols.

00:25:56.102 --> 00:25:58.969
If you require it, any gentleman
here can give you use of a sword.

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:01.906
Use of a sw-- what?

00:26:07.247 --> 00:26:09.738
- What's going on?
- I'm not rightly sure. What's going on?

00:26:09.816 --> 00:26:13.877
Well, first off, you'll be put up in lodgings
for the night, so you don't disappear.

00:26:13.954 --> 00:26:16.752
I wouldn't blame you, incidentally.

00:26:16.823 --> 00:26:20.816
Wing may be a spoiled dandy,
but he's an expert swordsman.

00:26:20.894 --> 00:26:23.124
He's killed a dozen men
with the long blade.

00:26:23.196 --> 00:26:25.255
You're the only one
gave him a reason.

00:26:25.332 --> 00:26:27.698
- Oh, this is a joke.
- [ Inara ] You'll need a second.

00:26:27.767 --> 00:26:31.168
- What's that?
- I'll take on the job.
- He fights if you refuse.

00:26:31.237 --> 00:26:34.604
Inara, come with me, please.

00:26:34.674 --> 00:26:37.734
Now, you taking on this job...

00:26:37.811 --> 00:26:40.006
being my second--
does this mean we're in business?

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.447
It means you're in mortal danger.

00:26:43.516 --> 00:26:48.010
But you mussed up Atherton's face, and
that has endeared you to me somewhat.

00:26:48.088 --> 00:26:51.353
You might even give him a fight...
before he guts you.

00:26:51.424 --> 00:26:53.187
[ Atherton ]
Inara.

00:27:01.368 --> 00:27:05.532
Up until the punching,
it was a real nice party.

00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:09.975
[ Breathing Heavily ]

00:27:15.849 --> 00:27:19.148
[ Pounding ]

00:27:41.916 --> 00:27:44.942
The captain's gone
and got himself in trouble.

00:27:45.019 --> 00:27:48.420
- A duel?
- With swords?

00:27:48.489 --> 00:27:52.425
The captain's a good fighter.
He must know how to handle a sword.

00:27:52.493 --> 00:27:55.121
I think he knows
which end to hold.

00:27:55.196 --> 00:27:58.222
All right, so wejust need to
figure out how to get him out of there.

00:27:58.299 --> 00:28:00.460
We have until
the morning, correct?

00:28:00.535 --> 00:28:03.003
- Do you know what lodging he's in?
- Oh!

00:28:03.071 --> 00:28:05.005
This is embarrassing.
Some of you seem...

00:28:05.073 --> 00:28:07.871
to be misapprehending
my purpose in being here.

00:28:07.942 --> 00:28:10.809
You're here to make sure we don't
do what these men are keen on doing.

00:28:10.879 --> 00:28:13.541
Penny for the smart lady.

00:28:13.615 --> 00:28:16.015
Persephone's my home.

00:28:16.084 --> 00:28:18.018
I gotta do business
with the people here.

00:28:18.086 --> 00:28:21.180
I don't want it known I brought
someone in caused this kind of ruckus.

00:28:21.256 --> 00:28:24.350
We'll just settle in
till this blows over...

00:28:24.425 --> 00:28:27.417
- one way or the other.
- [ Weapon Cocking, Whirring ]

00:28:29.797 --> 00:28:34.234
-Jayne, I wouldn't.
- Why not?

00:28:38.172 --> 00:28:41.608
- [ Weapons Cocking ]
- Hi.

00:29:00.995 --> 00:29:04.192
- Mal?
- [ Mal ] Whoa.

00:29:04.265 --> 00:29:06.460
What are you doin' here?

00:29:09.137 --> 00:29:11.765
Atherton's a heavy sleeper
night before a big day.

00:29:11.839 --> 00:29:14.433
You know, he's got that killing
in the morning, then a haircut later.

00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:18.104
Such a comfort having friends
visit at a time like this.

00:29:18.179 --> 00:29:21.148
- [ Grunts ]
- I knew the accommodations would be nice.

00:29:21.215 --> 00:29:23.149
Atherton doesn't skimp.

00:29:23.217 --> 00:29:26.948
I don't suppose I like being kept
by him as much as others do.

00:29:27.021 --> 00:29:30.388
So... how come
you're still attached to him?

00:29:30.458 --> 00:29:32.756
Because it's my decision,
not yours.

00:29:32.827 --> 00:29:35.227
Thought he made it pretty clear
he's got no regard for you.

00:29:35.296 --> 00:29:38.561
You did manage to push him
into saying something, yes.

00:29:38.633 --> 00:29:40.624
Made a nice justification
for the punch.

00:29:40.702 --> 00:29:44.729
He insulted you. I hit him.
Seemed like the thing to do.

00:29:44.806 --> 00:29:47.274
Why'd this get so complicated?

00:29:47.342 --> 00:29:50.470
Well, it's about to get simpler.

00:29:50.545 --> 00:29:53.981
There's a back door. The desk clerk
is on alert. He'll let us out.

00:29:54.048 --> 00:29:57.609
Whoa, I'm not runnin' off. And I don't know
what you got in your head...

00:29:57.685 --> 00:30:00.279
but I didn't do this to prove
some kind of point to you.

00:30:00.355 --> 00:30:03.415
I actually thought I was defending your honor.
And I never back down from a fight.

00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:05.686
Yes, you do.
You do all the time.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.355
Well, yeah.
But I'm not backing down from this one.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.365
He's an expert swordsman, Mal.

00:30:12.433 --> 00:30:15.766
You had trouble with the pillar.
How will your death help my honor?

00:30:15.837 --> 00:30:18.271
Well, see, I plan
on having it be his death.

00:30:18.339 --> 00:30:20.967
That's why I need lessons.

00:30:21.042 --> 00:30:25.069
I figure you know how,
bein' such an educated woman and all.

00:30:32.854 --> 00:30:34.788
He said not to do anything.

00:30:36.157 --> 00:30:38.148
He'll join us after he wins the duel.

00:30:38.226 --> 00:30:39.818
[Jayne ]
And what if he don't win?

00:30:39.894 --> 00:30:42.624
Doesn't hurt to have
a contingency plan, Kaylee.

00:30:44.665 --> 00:30:47.463
I'm thinking since we're unarmed...

00:30:47.535 --> 00:30:49.469
we should take them by surprise.

00:30:49.537 --> 00:30:52.802
- All at once.
- [ Zoe ] Not necessarily.

00:30:52.874 --> 00:30:58.369
We can lure one or two of'em away.
Say, infirmary.

00:31:00.648 --> 00:31:04.311
Take 'em out, be on Badger
before he knows what happens.

00:31:04.385 --> 00:31:07.684
[Jayne ]
Only if his attention is elsewhere.

00:31:07.755 --> 00:31:11.384
What we need's a diversion.

00:31:11.459 --> 00:31:13.552
I say Zoe gets naked.

00:31:13.628 --> 00:31:16.028
- Nope.
- I could get naked.

00:31:16.097 --> 00:31:17.223
- No!
- [ Zoe ] No.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.021
- River, you can't be here.
- [ Indistinct ]

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.694
Come on!

00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:57.397
- River! River, please.
- [ Badger ] Who's that, then?

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:05.374
Here, look at me.
What's your story, love?

00:32:05.446 --> 00:32:08.210
She's just, uh--just a passenger.

00:32:08.282 --> 00:32:11.445
Yeah? Why ain't she talkin'?
She got a secret?

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:15.819
- No, I'm--
- [ Cockney Accent ] Sure. I got a secret.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.984
More than one.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:23.156
Don't seem like that I tell 'em
to you now, do it?

00:32:23.231 --> 00:32:26.598
Anyone off Titan colony knows better
than to talk to strangers.

00:32:34.208 --> 00:32:38.144
You're talkin' loud enough
for the both of us, though, ain't ya?

00:32:38.212 --> 00:32:41.978
I've met a dozen like you.
Skipped off-home early.

00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:44.677
Minor graft jobs here and there.

00:32:44.752 --> 00:32:47.346
Spent some time in the lockdown,
but less than you claim.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:53.259
And you're, what, a petty thief
with delusions standing?

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.791
Sad little king of a sad little hill.

00:33:00.334 --> 00:33:02.598
Nice to see someone
from the old homestead.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.696
Not really.

00:33:05.773 --> 00:33:08.139
Call me if anyone interesting
shows up.

00:33:12.246 --> 00:33:15.010
I like her.

00:33:17.385 --> 00:33:22.618
That there-- exactly the kind
of diversion we could've used.

00:33:23.724 --> 00:33:25.658
Attack.

00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:29.661
- [ Groans ]
- How did I avoid that?

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:31.960
By being fast like a freak?

00:33:32.033 --> 00:33:35.127
No. Because you always
attack the same way...

00:33:35.203 --> 00:33:37.535
swinging from the shoulder
like you're chopping wood.

00:33:37.605 --> 00:33:41.803
You have to thrust with the point
sometimes or-or swing from the elbow.

00:33:41.876 --> 00:33:45.744
- Swinging from the shoulder feels stronger.
- It's also slower, Mal.

00:33:45.813 --> 00:33:48.043
You don't need strength
as much as speed.

00:33:48.115 --> 00:33:50.049
We're fragile creatures.

00:33:50.117 --> 00:33:53.245
It takes less than a pound
of pressure to cut skin.

00:33:53.321 --> 00:33:56.848
You know that?
They teach you that in whore academy?

00:33:59.227 --> 00:34:02.355
You have a strange sense
of nobility, Captain.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:06.594
You'll lay a man out for implying I'm a whore,
but you keep calling me one to my face.

00:34:06.667 --> 00:34:10.103
I might not show respect
to your job, but he didn't respect you.

00:34:10.171 --> 00:34:12.071
That's the difference.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:13.902
Inara, he doesn't even see you.

00:34:13.975 --> 00:34:17.069
Well, I guess death will solve
the issue to everyone's satisfaction.

00:34:17.144 --> 00:34:21.376
This [ Chinese ] duel is the result
of the rules of your society, not mine.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:25.408
You are always breaking the rules,
no matter what society you're in.

00:34:25.486 --> 00:34:27.420
You don't get along
with ordinary criminals either...

00:34:27.488 --> 00:34:29.422
which is why you are constantly
getting in trouble.

00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:31.515
You think following the rules
will buy you a nice life...

00:34:31.592 --> 00:34:33.526
even if the rules make you a slave.

00:34:35.096 --> 00:34:37.690
Don't take his offer.

00:34:37.765 --> 00:34:39.858
What?

00:34:39.934 --> 00:34:42.232
Don't do it.

00:34:42.303 --> 00:34:45.431
Just in the case that it happens,
that means that he's the fellow who killed me...

00:34:45.506 --> 00:34:47.701
and I don't like fellows
who kill me, not in general.

00:34:51.712 --> 00:34:55.546
I said before that I didn't have call
to stop you, and that's true.

00:34:57.518 --> 00:34:59.452
Anyways, don't.

00:35:05.826 --> 00:35:07.760
I need to get back.

00:35:10.898 --> 00:35:13.594
He'll be up early.

00:35:13.668 --> 00:35:17.195
Right. He's got that big day.

00:36:12.893 --> 00:36:17.387
Best be careful, Ath.
You know, these things are sharp.

00:36:17.465 --> 00:36:20.628
- He thinks he's doing well, doesn't he?
- He's being toyed with.

00:36:44.258 --> 00:36:46.749
- What's he doing?
- Don't fall for that!

00:36:51.298 --> 00:36:55.758
Well, this isn't going
to take long, is it?

00:37:19.427 --> 00:37:22.555
We're coming up on the end, miss.
You might not want to watch.

00:37:32.306 --> 00:37:34.365
Atherton, wait!

00:37:34.442 --> 00:37:37.741
I'll stay here, exclusive to you.
Just let him live.

00:37:52.126 --> 00:37:53.821
[ Man ]
He's down.

00:37:56.096 --> 00:37:57.654
You have to finish it, lad.

00:38:02.203 --> 00:38:05.104
You have to finish it.

00:38:05.172 --> 00:38:10.474
For a man to lay beaten and yet
breathing, it makes him a coward.

00:38:10.544 --> 00:38:13.604
- It's humiliation.
- Sure.

00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:16.241
It would be humiliating...

00:38:16.317 --> 00:38:20.845
having to lie there while the better man
refuses to spill your blood.

00:38:20.921 --> 00:38:24.652
Mercy is the mark of a great man.

00:38:24.725 --> 00:38:27.853
- [ Groans ]
- Guess I'm just a good man.

00:38:27.928 --> 00:38:31.420
- [ Groans ]
- Well, I'm all right.

00:38:31.499 --> 00:38:33.433
- [ Drops Sword ]
- [ Groaning ]

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.071
Inara? Inara!

00:38:43.143 --> 00:38:45.441
You've lost her, lad.
Be gracious.

00:38:45.513 --> 00:38:48.277
You set this up, whore...

00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:51.443
after I bought and paid for you.

00:38:51.519 --> 00:38:54.682
I should've uglied you up,
so no one else would want you.

00:38:56.156 --> 00:38:59.523
See how I'm not punching him?
I think I've grown.

00:38:59.593 --> 00:39:03.051
Well, get ready to starve.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.462
I'll see to it
you never work again.

00:39:06.534 --> 00:39:08.468
Actually, that's not how it works.

00:39:08.536 --> 00:39:12.131
You see, you've earned yourself
a black mark in the client registry.

00:39:12.206 --> 00:39:15.573
No Companion is going
to contract with you ever again.

00:39:15.643 --> 00:39:21.081
You'll have to rely on your winning
personality to get women. God help you.

00:39:24.818 --> 00:39:28.618
[ Groans ]
Ow, ow.

00:39:28.689 --> 00:39:30.623
You didn't have
to wound that man.

00:39:30.691 --> 00:39:33.888
Yeah, I know.
It was just funny.

00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:36.657
You willing to fight that hard
to protect my property...

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.494
I'll have it in your hold
before midnight.

00:39:47.474 --> 00:39:49.408
Mighty fine shindig.

00:39:58.419 --> 00:40:01.752
Doc's filling the shepherd in
on the plan.

00:40:01.822 --> 00:40:03.756
We're ready to move on your signal.

00:40:03.824 --> 00:40:07.123
Doc is the diversion.

00:40:07.194 --> 00:40:11.460
Did you ever see such a lazy crew?

00:40:11.532 --> 00:40:14.695
- Captain!
- You're hurt.

00:40:18.672 --> 00:40:22.904
- You get us a deal?
- I got a deal. Now get off my ship.

00:40:22.977 --> 00:40:25.343
So, very much for
a lovely night then.

00:40:26.847 --> 00:40:28.781
[ Whistles ]

00:40:32.786 --> 00:40:35.721
- Ow!
- Are you badly hurt?

00:40:35.789 --> 00:40:37.279
[ Groans ]

00:40:37.358 --> 00:40:40.418
We was just about
to spring into action, Captain.

00:40:40.494 --> 00:40:42.223
Complicated escape and rescue op.

00:40:42.296 --> 00:40:45.788
I was gonna watch.
It was very exciting.

00:40:50.604 --> 00:40:52.538
~~ [ Humming ]

00:41:17.431 --> 00:41:19.763
~~ [ Classical ]

00:41:40.688 --> 00:41:44.317
Thank you for the wine.
It's... very fresh.

00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:48.088
To Kaylee and her inter-engine
fermentation system.

00:41:49.463 --> 00:41:51.829
- Are you in pain?
- Absolutely.

00:41:51.899 --> 00:41:54.629
- I got stabbed, you know, right here.
- I saw.

00:41:54.702 --> 00:41:57.865
Don't care much for fancy parties.

00:41:57.938 --> 00:42:01.567
- Too rough.
- It wasn't entirely a disaster.

00:42:01.642 --> 00:42:05.578
- I got stabbed, right here.
- You also lined up exciting new crime.

00:42:07.314 --> 00:42:10.044
It's good to have cargo.

00:42:10.117 --> 00:42:12.381
Makes us a target for every other
scavenger out there, of course...

00:42:12.453 --> 00:42:16.583
- but sometimes that's fun too.
- [ Chuckles ]

00:42:20.494 --> 00:42:23.156
I am grateful, you know,
for the ill-conceived...

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:26.597
and highhanded attempt to defend
my honor, although I didn't want you to.

00:42:29.269 --> 00:42:31.203
Gracious as that is...

00:42:31.271 --> 00:42:35.002
as I look back... I probably should've
stayed out of your world.

00:42:35.075 --> 00:42:38.909
My world?
If it is that.

00:42:38.979 --> 00:42:41.140
I wasn't gonna stay, you know.

00:42:43.217 --> 00:42:46.846
Yeah? Why's that?

00:42:48.355 --> 00:42:51.347
Oh, someone needs to keep
Kaylee out of trouble.

00:42:51.425 --> 00:42:53.689
And all my things are here.

00:42:56.797 --> 00:43:00.756
Besides, why would I want
to leave serenity?

00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:05.197
Can't think of a reason.

00:43:05.272 --> 00:43:08.366
[ Lowing ]

00:43:51.251 --> 00:43:54.186
Grr! Arrgh!
