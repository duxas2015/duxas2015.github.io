WEBVTT

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.234
I don't want it.

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:18.241
River, you have to eat.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:21.244
It's good.
It tastes like--

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.940
- It's good.
- It smells like crotch.

00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:27.006
- Jayne!
- Well, it does.

00:00:27.084 --> 00:00:29.678
We don't even have to go
someplace fancy.

00:00:29.754 --> 00:00:32.188
We can just go
to the park or something.

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:34.952
- Feed the pigeons.
- Sure. Feed the pigeons...

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:37.789
probably get the firing squad
for littering.

00:00:37.862 --> 00:00:39.921
Come on.
It's not that bad.

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:43.057
It is. It's a core planet.
It's spotless. It's got sensors.

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:45.068
And where there ain't sensors,
there's feds.

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:48.401
All central planets
are the same.

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:51.305
Could you please tell my wife
the fun she's missing out on?

00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:54.003
Ariel's quite a nice place,
actually.

00:00:54.078 --> 00:00:56.205
There are some beautiful
museums, not to mention...

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.214
some of the finest restaurants
in the core.

00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:01.217
But... not boring,
like she made it sound.

00:01:01.285 --> 00:01:03.879
There's a, uh...

00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:05.478
uh--

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:08.320
- There's hiking.
- [ Wash ] Yeah.

00:01:08.392 --> 00:01:11.555
And you can go swimming in
a bioluminescent lake.

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:14.928
I don't care if it's got sunsets 24 hours a day.
I ain't setting foot on that planet.

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:17.331
No one is setting foot
on that fancy rock.

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:19.369
I don't want anyone
leaving the ship.

00:01:19.437 --> 00:01:21.997
Come to think of it, I don't want anyone
looking out the windows...

00:01:22.072 --> 00:01:24.006
or talking aloud.

00:01:24.074 --> 00:01:26.008
We're here to drop off Inara.
That's it.

00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:29.307
What's the point of coming to the core
if I can't even step off the boat?

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.474
You could have got off with
Shepherd Book at the Bathgate Abbey.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.577
Could've been meditating on the wonders
of your rock garden by now.

00:01:36.654 --> 00:01:39.350
Well, it beats
just sitting.

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:42.051
It is just sitting.

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:44.060
[ Zoe ] So how long are you
gonna be planet-side?

00:01:44.128 --> 00:01:46.062
[ Inara ]
Shouldn't be more than a day or two.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.065
[ Wash ] Big stop just to renew
your license to Companion.

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:53.035
- Can I use "Companion" as a verb?
- It's guild law.

00:01:53.103 --> 00:01:56.038
All Companions are required to undergo
a physical examination once a year.

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:58.734
[ Hawking ]

00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:04.371
Could you not do that
while we're-- ever?

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:10.520
[ Wash ]
So two days in a hospital. That's awful.

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.352
- Don't you just hate doctors?
- Hey.

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:15.915
[ Wash ]
I mean, present company excluded.

00:02:15.993 --> 00:02:19.793
Let's not be excluding people.
That'd be rude.

00:02:21.265 --> 00:02:24.200
- [ Groaning ] Son of a--
- [ Simon ] What the hell?

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:28.396
- River, no.
- Oh, my God. He's bleeding.

00:02:28.472 --> 00:02:31.236
- That's deep.
- Are you okay?
- River.

00:02:31.308 --> 00:02:33.037
[ Groans, Breathing Heavily ]

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.101
He looks better in red.

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:36.703
[ Groaning Continues ]

00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:43.213
[ Inhaling Sharply ]

00:02:43.287 --> 00:02:46.188
Gorram freak's
completely off her axle.

00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:50.091
- I'm sorry about this. I don't know what--
- Shut it. I ain't talking to you.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.185
She gotta go.
Both of them gotta go.

00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:54.197
Ariel's as good a place as any
to leave them.

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:58.065
- Might even pick us up a reward
for our troubles.
- No one's getting left.

00:02:58.135 --> 00:03:00.069
She belongs in a bughouse.

00:03:00.137 --> 00:03:03.163
You don't pitch her off this boat
right now, I swear to you--

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.333
What?
What do you swear,Jayne?

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.937
They don't get gone, you better
start locking up your room at night.

00:03:10.014 --> 00:03:12.312
Next time little sister
gets in a murdering mood...

00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:14.613
it might be you
she comes calling on.

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:17.449
Maybe Kaylee or Inara.

00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:20.786
You let them stay,
we're gonna find out.

00:03:23.093 --> 00:03:25.425
Finish your work, Doctor.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:28.727
This is my boat.
They're part of my crew.

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.166
No one's getting left.
Best you get used to that.

00:03:35.873 --> 00:03:37.864
You owe me a shirt.

00:03:40.644 --> 00:03:43.169
She's to stay confined to her room
at all times. No exceptions.

00:03:43.247 --> 00:03:45.715
Take her to the kitchen,
the infirmary, whatever...

00:03:45.783 --> 00:03:48.377
- you ask me first, understand?
- I do.

00:03:48.452 --> 00:03:51.819
When I took you and your sister in,
the deal was you keep her in check.

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.450
You can't hold up your end,
we're gonna have to revisit the deal.

00:04:00.097 --> 00:04:03.123
She's getting worse.
Isn't she?

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.998
Yes.

00:04:20.184 --> 00:04:22.118
Just look at the bright side.

00:04:22.186 --> 00:04:25.417
Maybe you'll meet a young,
handsome doctor.

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:27.650
He'll ask you out, and--

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:30.091
What's the Companion policy
on dating?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.822
- It's complicated.
- Hmm.

00:04:32.896 --> 00:04:35.831
- Well, that figures.
- Stay out of trouble.

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:38.333
You too. Bye.

00:04:40.471 --> 00:04:42.462
[Jayne Grunts ]

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.201
How are we gonna find a job
if we don't leave the ship?

00:04:45.275 --> 00:04:48.733
Alliance territory--
ain't any jobs worth having.

00:04:48.812 --> 00:04:52.009
Or the last three places
we've been.

00:04:52.082 --> 00:04:56.542
My pop always said,
"Anyone who can't find work
ain't lookin' hard enough."

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.351
- We ain't even lookin' at all.
- [ Simon ] You can stop looking.

00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:04.053
There's a client. Me.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.360
I have a job for you.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.630
~ Take my love, take my land ~

00:05:12.703 --> 00:05:16.161
~ Take me where I cannot stand ~

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.936
~ I don't care, I'm still free ~

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.207
~ You can't take the sky from me ~

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.976
~ Take me out to the black ~

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.508
~ Tell them I ain't comin'back ~

00:05:29.586 --> 00:05:32.282
~ Burn the land and boil the sea ~

00:05:32.356 --> 00:05:36.417
~ You can't take the sky from me ~

00:05:45.002 --> 00:05:47.766
~ There's no place I can be ~

00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:51.205
~ Since I've found serenity ~

00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:54.972
~ But you can't take the sky from me ~

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.719
- You've got a job for us?
- One that'll pay for itself ten times over.

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.121
[ Wash ]
Forget it. We ain't that desperate.

00:06:08.192 --> 00:06:12.754
Do you know what this is? It's a common
immune booster called isoprobyline.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.094
Street value
for a dosage this size--

00:06:15.165 --> 00:06:18.464
50 platinum,
maybe 20 credits.

00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:20.833
Propoxyn. Maybe 80.

00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:24.269
Hydrozopan, 200.

00:06:26.076 --> 00:06:29.443
And these are just from the med kit
I had with me when I came on board.

00:06:29.513 --> 00:06:32.414
At a hospital like the one
in Ariel City...

00:06:32.483 --> 00:06:34.542
they'll have shelves
of that stuff.

00:06:34.618 --> 00:06:38.281
Whatever the take, it's more than enough
payment for what I have in mind.

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:41.017
So the med vault
isn't the job?

00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:43.082
[ Simon ]
That's the payment.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.187
I tell you how to get in, get out,
and what's worth taking...

00:06:47.264 --> 00:06:50.131
if you help me get River into
the hospital's diagnostic ward.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.896
- [ Mal ] What's in the diagnostic ward?
- A 3-D neuro-imager.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.373
If I can get River in there, I might be able to
figure out what they did to her at the academy.

00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:59.602
So we get you and your sister
into the "whatcha" thing...

00:06:59.676 --> 00:07:02.042
and you tell us how to clean out
the hospital.

00:07:02.112 --> 00:07:04.580
- Yes.
- Not to be negative...

00:07:04.648 --> 00:07:06.878
but don't the hospital
need that medicine?

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.884
Government-run facility.

00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:10.886
They'd be restocked
in a matter of hours.

00:07:10.954 --> 00:07:12.888
She's right.
They'll never miss it.

00:07:12.956 --> 00:07:15.254
Plus folks on the rim
sure could use it.

00:07:15.325 --> 00:07:19.022
It's all very sweet stealing from
the rich, selling to the poor.

00:07:19.096 --> 00:07:22.497
But you're talking about breaking into
a highly secure Alliance facility.

00:07:22.566 --> 00:07:25.865
- How do plan on getting around security?
- It's not easy...

00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:28.461
but it can be done.

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:33.642
You see,
like all core hospitals...

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.077
St. Lucy's has its own
dedicated security force--

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:42.016
a small battery of local
Alliance federals substationed here.

00:07:42.085 --> 00:07:46.044
- Every floor, every doorway
is equipped with sensors.
- [ Beeping ]

00:07:46.123 --> 00:07:50.025
And at all points of entry,
patient eye-dent scans.

00:07:50.093 --> 00:07:52.118
However, once clear
of those checkpoints...

00:07:52.196 --> 00:07:55.893
movement within the facility itself
should be relatively unhindered.

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:59.561
- The standard layout
should put the med vaults--
- Go back to the eye-dent scans.

00:07:59.636 --> 00:08:01.570
You and your sister
are tagged fugitives.

00:08:01.638 --> 00:08:04.471
- How do you figure we're
gonna get you in the building?
- Through the front door.

00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:09.103
Believe me, Captain, getting
the two of us in is going to be easy.

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:12.979
The rest of you--
that is going to be the real trick.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:18.545
We'll need to procure
a few items off-ship. I've made a list.

00:08:18.622 --> 00:08:22.888
Given my status as a fugitive,
someone else will have to--

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.986
We have some volunteers. Good.

00:08:26.063 --> 00:08:29.829
Before we ever make it to the front door, we're
going to have to breach the perimeter.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.564
Only official vehicles are allowed in,
so we'll need one.

00:08:34.638 --> 00:08:37.630
Now obviously we can't steal
what we need.

00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:39.642
Any illegal activity
in the planning stages...

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.644
could end this thing
before it starts.

00:08:41.712 --> 00:08:44.647
St. Lucy's Hospital contracts
with the local municipal dump yard...

00:08:44.715 --> 00:08:47.206
for all its large disposals.

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:53.051
It figures. First time on the core,
and what do I get to do?

00:08:53.123 --> 00:08:58.117
Dig through trash. Couldn't he
send me shopping at the Triplex or--

00:08:58.195 --> 00:09:01.528
Ooh! Synchronizers!

00:09:01.598 --> 00:09:03.532
[ Simon ]
Big hospitals mean big waste...

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.728
so we shouldn't have any trouble
finding what we're looking for.

00:09:10.941 --> 00:09:13.933
[ Laughing ]

00:09:15.579 --> 00:09:18.139
We'll have to look
like we belong.

00:09:19.216 --> 00:09:21.207
[ Beeps ]

00:09:32.729 --> 00:09:35.493
All we have to do is slip
a couple ofbills into the right hands.

00:09:35.565 --> 00:09:38.966
That gets us uniforms,
I.D. badges and key cards.

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:42.699
A little creative forgery,
and we've got ourselves a working alias.

00:09:48.712 --> 00:09:50.873
Now, all these items
are easy to obtain.

00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:53.212
They'll get us up to the door.

00:09:53.283 --> 00:09:56.719
Now, in order to get us in--

00:09:56.787 --> 00:09:59.688
Patients were cynical, and not responding,
and we couldn't bring 'em back.

00:09:59.756 --> 00:10:01.553
- They were cyanotic--
- They were cyanotic--

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:04.093
- And not responsive--
- Responsive.

00:10:04.161 --> 00:10:07.358
- And we were unable to--
- Resuscitate them.
- [ Zoe ] Yes.

00:10:07.431 --> 00:10:09.194
- Resuscitate.
- Resuscitate them.

00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:12.929
- Which methods did you use?
- We tried pulmonary stimulators...

00:10:13.003 --> 00:10:16.200
and-- and cardiac--
We--

00:10:16.273 --> 00:10:17.535
- Infusers.
- Infusers.

00:10:17.607 --> 00:10:20.167
- Pulmonary stim--
- Pulmonary stimulators--

00:10:20.243 --> 00:10:23.906
- And cardiac infusers.
What about cortical electrodes?
- Oh.

00:10:25.015 --> 00:10:26.744
We forgot them.

00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:30.413
- Let's try that again.
- Yeah.

00:10:36.326 --> 00:10:39.227
- Pupils were fixed and dilapidated.
- Dilated.

00:10:39.296 --> 00:10:42.561
- Dilated! [ Speaking Chinese ] Shiny.
- [ Pounding Table ]

00:10:55.445 --> 00:10:57.879
We got there,
and the patients were cyanotic.

00:10:57.948 --> 00:10:59.813
Not responding.
Not responsive.

00:10:59.883 --> 00:11:03.410
And we tried to resuscitate them--
And despite our best efforts, they kicked.

00:41:35.498 --> 00:41:38.695
I, um--
I brought some medicine.

00:41:40.303 --> 00:41:43.170
Do you remember why
we went to the hospital?

00:41:43.239 --> 00:41:46.037
Is it time to
go to sleep again?

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:49.601
No, mei-mei.

00:41:54.751 --> 00:41:56.878
It's time to wake up.

00:42:42.265 --> 00:42:45.257
Grr! Arrgh!

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
