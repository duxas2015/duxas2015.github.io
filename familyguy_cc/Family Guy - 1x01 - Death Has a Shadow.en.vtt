00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:10.135
Mom, Dad, I found cigarettes
in Greg's jacket.

00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:12.466
- Greg, were you smoking cigarettes?
- No, Dad.

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:14.472
He's lying. There's no doubt about that.

00:00:14.574 --> 00:00:17.941
Greg, I'm afraid your punishment
will be four hours in the snakepit.

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:20.274
That'll give you time to think about
what you did.

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:21.573
Man!

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:23.248
That'll teach him.

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.079
Jan, I'm afraid you've earned
a day in the fire chamber...

00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:27.846
...for tattling on your brother.

00:00:29.288 --> 00:00:32.553
Smoking. How does
a boy like that go so wrong?

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.819
- They live in a crummy neighborhood.
- The Bradys?

00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:38.158
Yeah. They got robbers, thugs,
drug dealers. You name it.

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:39.731
You folks want some pancakes?

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:43.268
No, thanks. See, that's the worst
we got is Jemima's Witnesses.

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:46.995
"It seems today that all you see

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.571
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:54.077
"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.740
"on which we used to rely?

00:00:57.516 --> 00:01:00.485
"Lucky there's a family guy

00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:03.714
"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:05.552
"all the things that make us

00:01:05.658 --> 00:01:07.148
"laugh 'n' cry

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.924
"He's a family guy"

00:01:17.603 --> 00:01:20.834
Mom, my lips are too thin.
Can I please get collagen injections?

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.408
Meg, you don't need to change
the way you look.

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.910
You know, most of the world's problems
stem from poor self-image.

00:01:36.422 --> 00:01:39.414
Excellent! The mind-control device
is nearing completion!

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:41.823
Stewie, I said no toys at the table.

00:01:41.928 --> 00:01:43.122
Damn you, vile woman!

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.596
You've impeded my work since the day
I escaped from your wretched womb.

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:49.759
Don't pout, honey. When you were born...

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.430
...the doctor said you were
the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.635
But, of course. That was my victory day.
The fruition of my deeply-laid plans...

00:01:57.743 --> 00:02:01.941
...to escape from that cursed ovarian
bastille! Return the device, woman!

00:02:02.048 --> 00:02:03.572
No toys, Stewie.

00:02:03.683 --> 00:02:04.650
Very well, then.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.686
Mark my words, when you least expect it,
your uppance will come!

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:12.121
Mom, can I turn the heat up?

00:02:12.224 --> 00:02:15.284
Don't touch the thermostat, Meg.
Your father gets upset.

00:02:15.394 --> 00:02:17.385
Come on. This thing goes up to 90.

00:02:17.496 --> 00:02:18.428
Who touched the thermostat?

00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.089
God, how does he always know?

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:22.394
Brain implant, Meg. Every father's got one.

00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.401
Tells you when the kids mess with the dial.

00:02:24.503 --> 00:02:26.471
My thing went off!
Your thermostat okay?

00:02:26.572 --> 00:02:28.472
- Yeah, it's all right.
- Is my kid over here?

00:02:28.574 --> 00:02:29.632
Forget it! False alarm!

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:31.970
Ass ahoy.

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:35.570
Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got
your pants on. What's the occasion?

00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:37.239
He's going to a stag party.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.012
Lois, I work hard all week
to provide for this family.

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:41.347
I am the man of the house.

00:02:41.454 --> 00:02:44.651
As the man, I order you
to give me permission to go to this party.

00:02:44.757 --> 00:02:48.386
Look, at least promise me you won't drink.
Alcohol always leads to trouble.

00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:50.523
Come on. You're worrying about nothing.

00:02:50.696 --> 00:02:54.359
Remember when you got drunk
off the Communion wine at church?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.769
And so the Lord God smote poor Job...

00:02:57.903 --> 00:03:00.235
...with festering boils all over his body.

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:02.500
Man, I hate it when he tells this story.

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:06.805
Yet, miraculously,
Job was still able to retain his dignity.

00:03:06.912 --> 00:03:10.245
- Is that really the blood of Christ?
- Yes.

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:13.475
Man, that guy must've been wasted
24 hours a day.

00:03:14.153 --> 00:03:16.849
And then there was that time
at the ice cream store.

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.587
Butter Rum's my favorite.

00:03:21.694 --> 00:03:24.925
Remember you had an Irish coffee
the day we went to see Philadelphia?

00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:34.297
I got it. That's the guy from Big.
Tom Hanks, that's it.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.475
Funny guy, Tom Hanks.
Everything he says is a stitch.

00:03:37.576 --> 00:03:38.838
I have AIDS.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:42.977
- Promise me, Peter.
- Lois, honey, I promise.

00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:45.915
Not a drop of alcohol is gonna touch
these lips tonight.

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:47.918
Who wants to play Drink The Beer?

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.419
Right here.

00:03:49.522 --> 00:03:51.114
- You win.
- All right. What do I win?

00:03:51.223 --> 00:03:52.281
Another beer!

00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.949
I'm going for the high score!

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.290
Actually, Charlie's got the high score.

00:03:56.395 --> 00:03:58.260
Man. Your clock won't flush.

00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:02.357
I feel kind of bad, guys.
I promised my wife I wouldn't drink.

00:04:02.468 --> 00:04:05.369
- Don't feel bad, Peter.
- Gee. I never thought of it like that.

00:04:05.604 --> 00:04:06.832
Did you bring the porno?

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.568
Did I bring the porno?
You're gonna love it. It's a classic.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.110
Listen, Ilsa. If I take this thing out...

00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:16.204
...and you're not on it, you'll regret it.
Not today or tomorrow.

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:18.283
But soon, and for the rest of your life.

00:04:18.384 --> 00:04:20.045
Come on, llsa! Get on it!

00:04:23.322 --> 00:04:25.517
The statue was a gift from France.

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:26.784
What is this?

00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:29.690
Man. My kid must've taped
over this for history class.

00:04:30.963 --> 00:04:33.488
The Statue of Liberty?
What are we gonna do?

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.933
- Boys, we're gonna drink till she's hot.
- That's just crazy enough to work.

00:04:43.642 --> 00:04:45.269
Meg, finish your pancakes.

00:04:45.377 --> 00:04:48.107
- Chris, elbows off your father.
- Thanks, son.

00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:51.980
37 beers. You're setting
a great example for the kids, Peter.

00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:55.212
Yeah. A new family record.
Way to raise the bar, Dad.

00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:57.312
Chris, you're 13. Don't talk like that.

00:04:57.423 --> 00:04:59.983
Kids, Daddy only drank
so the Statue of Liberty...

00:05:00.092 --> 00:05:01.491
...would take her clothes off.

00:05:01.594 --> 00:05:05.086
- What did you promise me last night?
- I wouldn't drink at the stag party.

00:05:05.197 --> 00:05:08.064
- And what did you do?
- Drank at the stag...

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:11.227
I almost walked right into that one. God!

00:05:11.337 --> 00:05:14.397
Feels like accountants
are cranking adding machines in my head.

00:05:18.878 --> 00:05:21.745
Dick, you ever wonder
what's outside those walls?

00:05:21.847 --> 00:05:24.816
That's dangerous thinking, Paul.
You best stick to your work.

00:05:24.917 --> 00:05:25.884
Okay.

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:30.680
You see? A hangover is nature's way
of telling you I was right. I mean...

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.654
Mom, are you all right?

00:05:32.758 --> 00:05:36.455
My goodness.
This chair leg was loose. Isn't that silly?

00:05:36.562 --> 00:05:38.553
I could've broken my neck.

00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:39.789
Damn!

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.834
Honey. I took a cab home,
I slept on the table...

00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:46.234
...so I wouldn't wake you up.
Nothing bad happened.

00:05:46.338 --> 00:05:48.169
I guess you're right.

00:05:48.274 --> 00:05:50.936
Apology accepted.
All right, I'm going to work.

00:05:51.043 --> 00:05:52.806
Somebody's gotta put food on this table.

00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:57.813
How are you coming, Johnson?

00:05:57.917 --> 00:06:00.249
Mr. Weed, I've been working
on the new G.I. Jew line.

00:06:00.352 --> 00:06:02.513
And as you can see, they look great.

00:06:02.621 --> 00:06:03.645
You call these bagels?

00:06:03.756 --> 00:06:06.054
I'm glad he's on our side!

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.552
Peter!
What?

00:06:09.662 --> 00:06:10.856
Are you sleeping on the job?

00:06:10.963 --> 00:06:14.126
No. There's a bug in my eye
and I'm trying to suffocate him.

00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:18.067
Peter, I like you. But I need you to be
more than just eye candy around here.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.298
It's your job to watch for toys
that could be hazardous to kids.

00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:23.637
- Now, look sharp!
- Yes, sir!

00:06:35.487 --> 00:06:40.151
And now back to Action News 5.
Our top story tonight, "When Toys Attack."

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.886
Quite a situation we've got here, Tom.

00:06:41.994 --> 00:06:44.360
Quite a situation we've got here, Tom,
indeed, Diane.

00:06:44.463 --> 00:06:47.364
The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company
of Quahog, Rhode Island...

00:06:47.466 --> 00:06:50.526
...has released highly unsafe
products into the retail market.

00:06:50.903 --> 00:06:52.996
Come on, Timmy! Throw the Silly Ball!

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:56.898
Boy! A Pound Poochie!

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.601
Come on, Baby Heimlich, spit it out.

00:07:03.282 --> 00:07:04.374
Peter, I'm appalled.

00:07:04.483 --> 00:07:07.316
Your negligence has damaged
this company's reputation.

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:08.408
You're fired!

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.714
Jeez. For how long?

00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:13.781
My God! You got fired?

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:17.521
- Way to go, Dad! Fight the machine!
- How do you know about the machine?

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.360
Don't worry.
I'll still put food on this table.

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:23.026
Just not as much.
So it might get a little competitive.

00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:27.663
Who cares about food? Now we'll never
be able to afford my lip injections!

00:07:27.806 --> 00:07:30.172
Can we put her
out in the yard for a while?

00:07:30.276 --> 00:07:32.267
Okay, who's hungry?

00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:35.077
Jeez. How the hell
am I gonna break this to Lois?

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.707
If she finds out I got fired for drinking,
she's gonna blame me!

00:07:38.817 --> 00:07:42.275
Lie to her. It's okay to lie
to women. They're not people like us.

00:07:42.388 --> 00:07:44.879
I don't know. Hey, where's the other guy?

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:48.753
Come on, you bastard! I'm late for work.

00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:49.987
This is perfect!

00:07:50.562 --> 00:07:52.792
Look, I don't want your mom to worry,
all right?

00:07:52.898 --> 00:07:55.298
When she worries, she says,
"I told you so" and:

00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:59.303
"Stop doing that. I'm asleep."
So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay?

00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:01.737
Not a word to your mom
about me getting canned.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.239
What's that, Peter?

00:08:03.342 --> 00:08:06.334
- Nothing. The lost-my-job smells great.
- What?

00:08:06.445 --> 00:08:09.437
Meg, honey, can you pass
the fired-my-ass-for-negligence?

00:08:09.548 --> 00:08:11.209
Peter, are you feeling okay?

00:08:11.317 --> 00:08:13.979
I feel great!
I haven't got a job in the world.

00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:15.713
All right, then let's eat.

00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:18.517
I know you all hate eggplant, but...

00:08:19.658 --> 00:08:21.523
What on earth was that?

00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:26.692
What the deuce are you staring at?
It's tuna fish...

00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:28.191
...and nothing else.

00:08:32.638 --> 00:08:34.071
How's your job search going?

00:08:34.173 --> 00:08:37.438
It sucks, Brian. I've already
been through two jobs this week.

00:08:37.543 --> 00:08:39.067
I got fired off of that commercial.

00:08:39.178 --> 00:08:41.840
Try it again.
"I'm caca for Cocoa Puffs."

00:08:41.947 --> 00:08:43.676
No, damn it! Take 26!

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:47.550
Then I had that job as the sneeze guard
for that restaurant's salad bar.

00:08:50.222 --> 00:08:51.382
Take it outside, lady.

00:08:51.724 --> 00:08:53.817
I thought I could win money
in that talent show.

00:08:54.193 --> 00:08:57.629
And the prize goes
to The von Trapp Family Singers!

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.022
That is bull...

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.365
Peter, I know it's a dangerous precedent...

00:09:03.469 --> 00:09:05.699
...but you might want to tell Lois the truth.

00:09:05.804 --> 00:09:08.932
What? That I can't provide for my family?
That she's always right?

00:09:09.041 --> 00:09:11.475
That I didn't stand up to a tank
in Tiananmen Square?

00:09:16.048 --> 00:09:18.949
Screw this!
I just came over to buy some fireworks!

00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:21.783
You can't keep lying to her
about losing your job.

00:09:21.887 --> 00:09:24.515
Eventually, she'll find out
where you're going every day.

00:09:24.623 --> 00:09:25.555
Yeah.

00:09:28.794 --> 00:09:31.354
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I'll tell her tonight.

00:09:48.147 --> 00:09:49.637
Victory is mine!

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.982
I'll need the checkbook
in the morning.

00:09:52.084 --> 00:09:54.109
I'm going to Stop 'N Shop
for some sweet corn.

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.880
You're spending money on food again?

00:09:55.988 --> 00:09:57.615
Lois, we just had dinner.

00:09:57.723 --> 00:10:01.853
I enjoyed it so much,
I thought we'd eat again tomorrow.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.554
Since when are you so concerned
about our food budget?

00:10:04.663 --> 00:10:05.857
I just...

00:10:05.964 --> 00:10:09.127
Lois, this is really hard for me to say, but...

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:11.031
What is it, Peter?

00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:14.298
- You're getting kind of fat.
- What?

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:16.670
It's just... It's not healthy.

00:10:16.775 --> 00:10:20.074
Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape
three times a week.

00:10:20.179 --> 00:10:22.044
When was the last time you saw your toes?

00:10:22.147 --> 00:10:24.638
I thought you people were
supposed to be jolly.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.048
Peter, what the hell is the matter with you?

00:10:27.152 --> 00:10:30.246
Honey, if there's something wrong,
you can tell me.

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:34.257
- Sorry, man. Am I late? What did I miss?
- Thank God you're here. What do I do?

00:10:34.359 --> 00:10:36.589
Tell him to keep quiet. He's in too deep.

00:10:36.695 --> 00:10:38.287
I don't know.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.756
Where's the other guy?

00:10:41.066 --> 00:10:42.590
This is unbelievable!

00:10:43.635 --> 00:10:46.900
I promise you, everything's fine.
You got nothing to worry about.

00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:50.168
Well, well, Mother!
We meet again!

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.800
Stewie, I thought
I tucked you in an hour ago.

00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:56.039
Not tightly enough it would seem.
And now you contemptible harpy...

00:10:56.148 --> 00:10:58.616
...I shall end your reign
of matriarchal tyranny.

00:10:58.717 --> 00:11:00.651
You can play tomorrow, honey.

00:11:00.752 --> 00:11:02.242
Right now it's bedtime.

00:11:02.921 --> 00:11:05.321
Blast you and your estrogenical treachery!

00:11:05.424 --> 00:11:06.721
Sweet dreams, kiddo.

00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:08.190
You have the power to end this!

00:11:11.296 --> 00:11:12.661
How'd she take it?

00:11:12.764 --> 00:11:14.629
I told her she was fat.

00:11:14.733 --> 00:11:15.995
No.

00:11:16.702 --> 00:11:18.499
I hate lying to Lois. It's just...

00:11:18.604 --> 00:11:20.697
It's the best way
to keep her from the truth.

00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:23.274
You have no choice.
Your unemployment will dry up soon.

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:26.811
She'll probably sense something's amiss
when they repossess your house.

00:11:26.912 --> 00:11:29.142
You really oughta think
of your family's welfare.

00:11:29.248 --> 00:11:30.715
Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea!

00:11:32.918 --> 00:11:37.116
Okay, do you have any disabilities,
past injuries, physical anomalies?

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.518
I didn't have gas
for the first time until I was 30.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.895
What the hell was that?

00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:51.800
Guys, our money problems
are over! We're officially on welfare.

00:11:51.904 --> 00:11:54.338
Come on, help me scatter car parts
on the front lawn.

00:11:54.439 --> 00:11:55.599
How much are we getting?

00:11:55.707 --> 00:11:57.971
Let's see. $150 a week.

00:11:58.477 --> 00:12:00.206
Wait. That's a comma, not a decimal.

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:03.336
Whoops.

00:12:03.715 --> 00:12:05.979
No, I haven't seen Peter all afternoon.

00:12:06.084 --> 00:12:07.676
I was giving a piano lesson.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.750
Stewie, why don't you play
in the other room?

00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:12.187
Why don't you burn in hell?

00:12:12.991 --> 00:12:14.652
No dessert for you, young man.

00:12:15.227 --> 00:12:17.695
Who would've thought getting drunk
would get me...

00:12:17.796 --> 00:12:20.663
...$150,000 a week from the government?

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:22.061
This is why I don't vote.

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:24.431
Maybe somebody down there
was drinking, too.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.964
Mr. President, why do you think
the public supports you...

00:12:28.073 --> 00:12:29.768
...during these impeachment proceedings?

00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:31.342
Probably because you're so fat.

00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:35.075
Peter, you might want to call
the Welfare Commission.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.080
That check is obviously an oversight.

00:12:37.182 --> 00:12:40.709
Not necessarily. Maybe I'm like
their one millionth customer.

00:12:40.819 --> 00:12:42.878
What?
You're gonna spend $150,000 a week?

00:12:42.988 --> 00:12:45.047
- Yeah.
- On what?

00:12:45.624 --> 00:12:49.924
Oh, my God!
Peter, you bought the statue of David?

00:12:50.028 --> 00:12:52.519
No. I just rented it.
But they're gonna be ticked.

00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:55.259
The penis broke off
while I was loading it into the car.

00:12:58.337 --> 00:13:00.134
I shall call you "Eduardo."

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:02.134
Peter, how can we afford this?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.208
You won't believe it, Mom! Dad's getting...

00:13:04.309 --> 00:13:05.401
A big raise!

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.171
Peter, that's wonderful!

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:08.268
But, Dad, I thought...

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.611
The kind of raise that'll allow me
to give my kids a big allowance...

00:13:11.717 --> 00:13:14.242
...just for keeping their big mouths shut.
Come on, guys.

00:13:14.353 --> 00:13:16.787
I'll buy us
the most expensive meal we've ever had.

00:13:17.889 --> 00:13:20.915
Yeah.
I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas, please.

00:13:21.026 --> 00:13:21.993
I beg your pardon?

00:13:22.094 --> 00:13:24.085
6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas.

00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:25.993
And a "So-sage" McBiscuit, please.

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:29.696
Peter, what's the big surprise?

00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:32.770
You know how I always said
you should be treated like a queen?

00:13:32.871 --> 00:13:34.771
I got you your own jester.

00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:37.670
Good to be here in New England.

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:39.835
And what's the deal
with "New" England anyway?

00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:44.245
It's over 200 years old!
Last time I checked, that's not that new.

00:13:48.887 --> 00:13:49.854
This is great.

00:13:49.955 --> 00:13:53.584
I can finally afford to give my little girl
the lips she's always dreamed of.

00:13:53.692 --> 00:13:55.421
Thank you, Daddy!

00:13:56.895 --> 00:13:58.658
I don't know, Peter. Lips are one thing.

00:13:58.764 --> 00:14:01.528
But did you have to buy
breast implants for Chris?

00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:02.759
It makes him happy.

00:14:02.868 --> 00:14:04.597
These are cool.

00:14:08.206 --> 00:14:09.696
When did you get a pool?

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:11.207
It's a moat.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:12.298
I know it's silly...

00:14:12.411 --> 00:14:15.847
...but my husband thinks our family
needs extra protection now that...

00:14:15.947 --> 00:14:17.312
...we're rich.

00:14:17.416 --> 00:14:18.440
Does it work?

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.144
It does keep the Black Knight at bay.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.156
Congratulations in all your success.
Here's your welfare check.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:30.628
What the...

00:14:35.467 --> 00:14:36.832
Hi, honey.

00:14:38.804 --> 00:14:39.828
What?

00:14:39.938 --> 00:14:43.738
I know what I did was wrong.
But I only did it for you and the kids.

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:46.709
Except for the jukebox in the bathroom.
That was for Peter.

00:14:46.812 --> 00:14:50.976
Yeah, from the American taxpayers.
I am so mad I can't see straight.

00:14:51.083 --> 00:14:53.074
No problem.
We got money to get that fixed...

00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:57.588
...with enough left for us to buy our way
out of any trouble our kids might get into.

00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:58.815
Just like the Kennedys.

00:14:58.924 --> 00:15:01.518
I feel like I don't
even know you anymore, Peter.

00:15:01.626 --> 00:15:04.459
The man I married would never think
he could fix a problem...

00:15:04.563 --> 00:15:06.087
...just by spending money!

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.923
Boy, she's pretty pissed.

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:11.366
Who thought fraud
would be one of her buttons?

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.803
Why have a jukebox
in the john if your wife's mad at you?

00:15:14.906 --> 00:15:17.670
Peter, you may have to return
that money to the taxpayers.

00:15:17.776 --> 00:15:19.971
But I gotta make sure
Lois knows I'm doing it.

00:15:20.078 --> 00:15:21.909
I need an event with thousands of people.

00:15:22.013 --> 00:15:24.038
Something that everybody cares about.

00:15:25.484 --> 00:15:27.418
We might have to leave
Rhode Island for this.

00:15:27.986 --> 00:15:31.888
The air is electric here
at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight!

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.925
Pat, it's safe to say that all
these fans came out here...

00:15:35.026 --> 00:15:37.017
...to watch a game of football!

00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:39.120
John, we're in commercial.

00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:42.928
Yeah, I know.
I'm just making conversation. Come on.

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:45.062
Football!

00:15:47.506 --> 00:15:51.101
Amazing. You can barely drive a car.
Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp?

00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:53.871
Yeah, America's great, isn't it?
Except for the South.

00:15:53.979 --> 00:15:55.742
Boy, I hope Lois is watching.

00:15:55.847 --> 00:15:58.008
Okay, taxpayers, here you go!

00:15:59.851 --> 00:16:02.513
Looks like we're getting some rain
here tonight, John.

00:16:02.621 --> 00:16:06.079
Yeah. Hey, wait a second!
This is no ordinary rain!

00:16:06.391 --> 00:16:08.484
It's some kind of crazy money rain!

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:11.994
I'm being told it's a man and his dog
throwing cash out of a blimp.

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:15.863
Man. I hope this works. Otherwise,
I'm gonna have to start dropping these.

00:16:20.772 --> 00:16:23.900
The crowd is storming the field!
This is pandemonium!

00:16:24.009 --> 00:16:26.603
Have you ever seen anything like this, Pat?

00:16:27.746 --> 00:16:31.807
Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl.
This is the old "trying to make amends...

00:16:31.917 --> 00:16:35.717
"...for spending $150,000 a week
in misappropriated welfare funds" play.

00:16:35.821 --> 00:16:40.554
I don't care what it is! That guy's ruining
a perfectly good game of football!

00:16:40.692 --> 00:16:42.956
- Madden to Fox Security.
- Go ahead.

00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:44.858
Take them down!
Yes, sir.

00:16:54.039 --> 00:16:55.131
How was your shower?

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.141
I tell you, all of the rumors
about dropping the soap are true.

00:16:58.243 --> 00:16:59.232
Really?

00:16:59.344 --> 00:17:01.539
You can't hold onto that thing
to save your life.

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.910
It was slipping everywhere.
Guys were laughing.

00:17:04.015 --> 00:17:06.176
There's the guy
that couldn't hold the soap.

00:17:06.284 --> 00:17:07.911
That was classic.

00:17:08.553 --> 00:17:10.919
Boy. I really let Lois down this time.

00:17:11.022 --> 00:17:12.319
Do you think she'll wait for me?

00:17:12.424 --> 00:17:13.982
If every woman dumped her husband...

00:17:14.092 --> 00:17:16.788
...for crashing a blimp,
no one would be married.

00:17:16.895 --> 00:17:19.295
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, I got the top bunk.

00:17:22.267 --> 00:17:24.792
My collagen is wearing off.

00:17:24.903 --> 00:17:27.303
Honey, sagging lips are just nature's way...

00:17:27.405 --> 00:17:30.397
...of telling you you shouldn't
cover for your father's lie.

00:17:30.508 --> 00:17:33.705
What does it mean when your armpits
cry stinky tears?

00:17:33.812 --> 00:17:35.871
It means you're becoming a man.

00:17:35.981 --> 00:17:39.712
But hopefully not the kind who stays out
all day and doesn't call...

00:17:39.818 --> 00:17:42.343
...like your father
who shall remain nameless.

00:17:42.454 --> 00:17:45.287
Hello, Mother.
Hi there, sweetie.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.950
You know, Mother,
life is like a box of chocolates.

00:17:48.059 --> 00:17:50.323
You never know what you're going to get.

00:17:50.428 --> 00:17:53.090
Your life, however,
is more like a box of active grenades!

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.668
Now, I offer one last chance
for deliverance.

00:17:57.769 --> 00:18:00.829
Return my mind-control device
or be destroyed.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.404
You just want your toy back.

00:18:04.509 --> 00:18:06.204
Okay, here you go, honey.

00:18:07.078 --> 00:18:09.273
Yes... Well, victory is mine!

00:18:13.418 --> 00:18:14.612
Damn you all!

00:18:16.321 --> 00:18:17.447
Hello?

00:18:18.256 --> 00:18:19.621
Oh, my God!

00:18:25.196 --> 00:18:27.096
Lois, am I glad to see you.

00:18:27.198 --> 00:18:29.063
I have nothing to say to you, Peter.

00:18:29.167 --> 00:18:31.294
I gave the money back.
Why are you still steamed?

00:18:31.403 --> 00:18:34.804
Peter, you lied to me,
you betrayed my trust.

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.204
Compared to that,
welfare fraud doesn't even matter.

00:18:37.309 --> 00:18:40.278
Really?
Let's hope the judge feels that way.

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:43.108
This court will come to order.

00:18:43.915 --> 00:18:46.383
I figured the sooner I cashed the check...

00:18:46.484 --> 00:18:49.248
...the sooner they'd catch their mistake.

00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:51.521
Why are we making a federal case
out of this?

00:18:51.623 --> 00:18:54.148
Don't you think you should
have alerted the government...

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:55.556
...of such a gross overpayment?

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.925
I was gonna call them.
But my favorite episode...

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.056
...of Different Strokes was on.
The one where Arnold and Dudley...

00:19:02.167 --> 00:19:04.499
...get sexually molested
by the bike shop owner?

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.803
All right. Now I want you boys
to scream real loud at my ass.

00:19:08.173 --> 00:19:10.607
And everybody learns a valuable lesson.

00:19:10.709 --> 00:19:12.404
Mr. Griffin, have you learned a lesson?

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.035
Yes. Stay the hell away
from that bike shop.

00:19:17.182 --> 00:19:20.743
Okay, everybody, I feel really bad
about what I did. I just...

00:19:20.852 --> 00:19:22.376
I don't know. I saw the one chance...

00:19:22.487 --> 00:19:25.684
...l'd ever have to give my family
the things they deserve.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.020
I guess I screwed it up.
I cheated the government.

00:19:28.126 --> 00:19:30.617
And worst of all, I lied to my wife.

00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:32.656
And she deserves better.

00:19:32.764 --> 00:19:34.197
I'm sorry, honey.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:37.234
Mr. Griffin, I think your words
have touched us all.

00:19:37.335 --> 00:19:39.462
I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison.

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:40.793
No!

00:19:40.905 --> 00:19:41.963
- No!
- No!

00:19:42.073 --> 00:19:42.971
No!

00:19:43.074 --> 00:19:44.041
Yeah!

00:19:50.715 --> 00:19:52.910
Excuse me, Your Honor?
Yes?

00:19:53.018 --> 00:19:56.351
Look, my husband may be
a bit thoughtless at times.

00:19:56.454 --> 00:19:59.946
He may even be downright stupid.

00:20:00.058 --> 00:20:02.390
But I know he only accepted that money...

00:20:02.494 --> 00:20:05.395
...because he wanted to be
a good husband and father.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.558
But what he needs to remember
is that we love him.

00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:11.567
And no matter what,
I'll always stand by him.

00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:13.500
I love you too, honey.

00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:17.573
That was very moving, Mrs. Griffin.
Okay, you can go to jail with him!

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:18.642
What?

00:20:18.743 --> 00:20:22.770
24 months in prison? Unacceptable!
Intolerable as it may be...

00:20:22.881 --> 00:20:26.180
...l'm completely dependent upon
those wretched drones for sustenance.

00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:29.344
Let us see how the constitution
of American justice fares...

00:20:29.454 --> 00:20:31.285
...against the device!

00:20:41.032 --> 00:20:42.294
Is that your boy?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.231
What? Yeah. That's Stewie.

00:20:44.335 --> 00:20:49.170
Gosh. I can't separate a kid that young
from his father. It's unjudgmenly.

00:20:49.274 --> 00:20:51.401
- Hell, you've learned your lesson, right?
- Yeah.

00:20:51.509 --> 00:20:54.569
- All right. You're free.
- Wow! Can you give me my job back?

00:20:54.679 --> 00:20:55.668
No.

00:20:56.314 --> 00:20:58.077
- Yes.
- All right!

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.078
That was a crazy one, Dick.

00:21:04.189 --> 00:21:07.352
It sure was. In this next blooper
from Joanie Loves Chachi...

00:21:07.459 --> 00:21:09.757
...watch what happens when Scott Baio
tries to say:

00:21:09.861 --> 00:21:11.954
"She sells seashells
down by the seashore."

00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:13.462
What does your mom do?

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.055
She sells seashells down by the...

00:21:17.035 --> 00:21:18.559
That is kind of a tongue twister.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.729
It's good to have you home, Peter.

00:21:20.839 --> 00:21:23.137
Honey, I knew everything
would turn out okay.

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:24.674
I sure am gonna miss being rich.

00:21:24.776 --> 00:21:26.744
Don't worry.
I got a way to get money.

00:21:26.845 --> 00:21:28.369
Not another welfare scam?

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.641
No. Minority scholarship.

00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:40.019
No.
Are you insane?

00:21:40.125 --> 00:21:42.889
Okay, I mean sexual harassment suit.

00:21:44.062 --> 00:21:45.324
No.
Don't think so.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.658
Absolutely outrageous.

00:21:46.764 --> 00:21:48.197
Okay, disability claim.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
