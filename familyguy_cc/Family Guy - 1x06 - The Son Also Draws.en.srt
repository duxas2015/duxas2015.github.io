1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,100
Blasted matriarch!

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,800
She has failed once again to replenish
this frigid box with potations.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,400
l shall give her a piece of my mind!

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,100
Damn it!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,600
Now look here, you.... Oh, my God!

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Now you shouldn't be frightened, Stewie.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,600
What you saw was actually
a very beautiful thing.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,500
Evidently, madam, you and l differ greatly
in our conception of beauty.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,500
What l just witnessed
was ghastlier than a thousand ghouls!

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,500
Stewie, mommies and daddies
like to hug each other that way.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,100
ln fact, sweetie,
that's sort of how you were created.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,200
That is a vile and odious lie!

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,300
How dare you fill my head
with such loathsome propaganda?

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,700
Get out, you horrid woman!

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, honey. l'll go get your teddy bear.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,500
Good Lord.
You saw them together, didn't you?

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,100
You know the tub
where you take your little baths?

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,800
They've done it there, too.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,500
LOlS:
''lt seems today that all you see

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,300
''is violence in movies and sex on TV

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,900
''But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,100
''on which we used to rely?

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,400
''Lucky there's a family guy

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,100
''Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,900
''all the things that make us

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,300
''laugh 'n' cry

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,000
''He's a family guy''

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,700
What in the name of our Christian God?
You're out of the semicircle!

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,000
All Scouts have to sit in the semicircle!

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,100
Why?

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,700
Why? Saunders, tell him why!

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,200
Because it's Rule 142-B!

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,900
Because it's Rule 142-B!

34
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,400
Good job, Scout.
Now drop and give me 20!

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you, sir!

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,700
Ladies, this Saturday at 0800
there will be a soapbox derby...

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,400
...as a reward for all your obedience.

38
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,900
Mom, Dad, I reaIIy Iike Potsie.

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,100
Why not, dear? Potsie's a very nice boy.

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,800
No, Mom. I mean, I reaIIy Iike Potsie.

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,900
MR. CUNNlNGHAM:
We heard you the first time.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,900
You have a homosexuaI attraction
to Potsie.

43
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,000
Anything on that remote lower than mute?

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,300
l got a surprise for you, Chris.

45
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,600
lt'll have to wait.
This is where the Fonz goes....

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,900
Take that, 1950s society! Okay, let's go.

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,100
Chris, this is the speed machine
that's gonna win you the soapbox derby.

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,900
But, Dad, l was supposed to build it myself.
lt's a rule.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come on. Rules were made to be broken.

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,200
Here, let me show you the turbo booster.

51
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,100
Dad, what would you say if l told you
l didn't want to be in the Scouts?

52
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,800
l'd say come again?
And then l'd laugh because l said ''come.''

53
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,900
But thank God that's not the case.
You're a Scout.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,300
And you know what that means?
That means l love you.

55
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,400
Meg?

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,400
Chris, get out of here!
You're not allowed in my room.

57
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,700
l thought that was just
when you were asleep.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,100
What do you want?

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,100
l don't want to be in the Scouts anymore.
l just want to draw.

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,200
l was kinda hoping you could tell Dad.
But try and open with a joke.

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,500
Tell him yourself.

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,400
l can't.
l don't want to disappoint him again.

63
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,400
You remember when he tried to sneak me
into the County Fair?

64
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,700
One, please.

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Wait a second! Your ass just sneezed!
And horses can't talk! No!

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,400
Nothing about this adds up at all!

67
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,700
Okay, look. Dad is really easy.
All you have to do is sit on his lap...

68
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,000
...give him a big kiss on the cheek,
look him right in the eye, and he's butter.

69
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,300
What the hell?

70
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,400
Dad, the Scouts are no fun. And l....
Wait a minute.

71
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,100
Chris, l am going to stand up,
walk out of this room...

72
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,500
...and we will never speak of this again.

73
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,300
Speed, you should not race! Ha-ha!

74
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,700
The Mach 5 is not ready! Ha-ha!

75
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,300
But Pops, l must race! Ha-ha!

76
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Very well.
But l am not really your father! Ha-ha!

77
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
Okay girls, get ready...

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
...get set....

79
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,700
Please God, l don't ask you for much.

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,300
But let my boy win this race.

81
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,300
Do not go until l wave my flag.
l can't stress that enough.

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,500
l'll wave it once
just to show you how it looks.

83
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
CHRlS: Look out!

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,800
Griffin is disqualified!

85
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,900
Your boy is out of the Scouts!

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,900
Who died and made you President Nixon?

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,700
Look, it's been two years!

88
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,300
Your idiot son hasn't earned
a single merit badge.

89
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,100
lf you'll excuse me,
l've got to administer some spankings.

90
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,000
Come on. Give him a little more time.

91
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,000
All right!
You've got three days to earn a badge!

92
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,300
Three days! That's tomorrow!
We gotta get going!

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Stewie, look what
Mommy made for dessert.

94
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,100
Jell-O. How exotic!
l feel like l'm on the deck of the QE II.

95
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
Me and Chris will take ours to go.

96
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,200
We've only got one more night
to get that badge.

97
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,400
Dad, maybe we should just give up.
l mean, we tried everything.

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,500
We almost got that one for insect study.

99
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,800
Look, Chris. lt's a whole family of WASPs.

100
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,300
My, Margaret. What a sub-par ham.

101
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,200
Perhaps l can't bake a ham.

102
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,400
But what l can cook up
is a little grace and civility at the table.

103
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,200
Patty, did you know that your mother
is a whore?

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,300
l think it's great that you and Chris've been
spending so much time together.

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,300
But he's the one
who should be earning that badge.

106
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,700
Where do you get off telling me
how to raise my son?

107
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,500
Right. Okay. We'll try it your way, honey.

108
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,100
There's my Scout!

109
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,300
Not anymore, Dad. l'm out.

110
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,800
They made me turn in my uniform
and everything.

111
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,600
What? Those bastards!
Don't you worry. l'll get you back in!

112
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,500
lt's okay, Dad. l'm not really--

113
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,200
Don't take no for an answer, Chris.
You're a Griffin.

114
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,000
And a Griffin never knows when to stop.

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,700
Clear!

116
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Clear!

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,500
You saved my life, Doctor!

118
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,700
Clear!

119
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,400
l'm calling that troop leader.
We're going over his head.

120
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Straight to the Scout head office
in New York.

121
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,200
Pack your bags, you guys!
The Griffins are hitting the Big Apple!

122
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,800
Ha-ha! Did you hear?
The Griffins are going to New York!

123
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,600
This does not affect us at all. Ha-ha!

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,800
l can't believe we're going to New York.

125
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,700
Dad, you don't really have to do this.

126
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Yes, l do. No boy of mine is gonna get
booted out of the Scouts.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
What the hell do you think you're doing?

128
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,200
Strapping you in, honey,
so you don't get hurt.

129
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,200
So l don't get hurt.

130
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,100
That's the best you can do,
you dull-witted termagant?

131
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
l brought your Raffi tape.

132
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,700
Play WheeIs on the Bus
and get the hell out of my sight.

133
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Where's Brian?

134
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,200
Aren't you coming?

135
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,900
No, thanks. l've been to New York.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,200
lt's like Prague sans the whimsy.

137
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,400
Will you be okay by yourself?.

138
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,400
l think l'll manage.

139
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,800
All right, you guys. We're off!

140
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,000
Those Scouts are never gonna know
what hit them.

141
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,600
And neither will that guy.

142
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,500
Okay. l'm thinking of a movie.

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,800
-ls it an action movie?
-No.

144
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,800
-ls it a musical?
-No.

145
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,500
-ls it a good movie?
-lt has its moments.

146
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,900
-CooI Runnings.
-Right!

147
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,000
After years of study, I've discovered
the secret to Ionger Iife in canines.

148
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,500
And that secret is--

149
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,200
We interrupt this program
for some episodes of One Day at a Time.

150
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,000
Damn it, JuIie. I'm a singIe mother
doing the best damn job she knows how!

151
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,300
And damn it, Schneider!

152
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,600
I asked you to fix
that damn sink two days ago!

153
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,400
I'II fix your sink, Miss Romano.

154
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,800
And by that I mean I'II have sex with you.

155
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,300
And by that, I mean I'II fix your sink.

156
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,200
And by ''sink, '' I mean
your reproductive organ.

157
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,800
And by ''reproductive organ, ''
I mean the thing between your knees.

158
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,300
And by ''the thing between your knees, '' I....

159
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,500
I guess that one's kind of seIf-expIanatory.

160
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Peter, we're lost.

161
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,900
Would you please ask for directions?

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We are not lost. And even if we were...

163
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,200
...l can't ask a human being for directions.

164
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,700
-Why not?
-Because l'm a man.

165
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,900
Haven't you ever seen
a stand-up comedian, Lois?

166
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,200
Dad, maybe we should go home.

167
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,000
No way.
We came to get you back into the Scouts.

168
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,800
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

169
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,800
-What was that?
-Nothing.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,800
Peter, the car is making funny noises.

171
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,800
You're wrong again, Lois.
That wasn't the car.

172
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,600
Although you were right
about that prune smoothie.

173
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,800
Are you okay?

174
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,500
l'll be fine.
l just have to concentrate on driving.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Come on! That one's not even real!

176
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
God! We gotta stop!

177
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,000
Wow! An lndian casino!

178
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,500
Yeah. l gotta find me the stink lodge!

179
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,200
Come on, you guys. No time to lose!

180
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,700
Hold it.

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,300
Hold it!

182
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Hold it!

183
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,800
AUTOMATED lNDlAN: WeIcome
to our casino, paIefaces.

184
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,300
FeeI free to visit gift shop in Iobby
and restaurant on second fIoor.

185
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,700
Do you have reservations?

186
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,500
OnIy about the veaI!

187
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,600
This is gonna be a photo finish, Lois!

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,500
l'm gonna ask someone for directions.
Meg, watch Stewie.

189
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,100
Excuse me.
Can you tell me how to get to New York?

190
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,700
Sure. But what's your hurry, ma'am?

191
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
Don't you want to play first?

192
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,800
Thank you.
But l really don't approve of gambling.

193
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,600
Technically it's not really gambling.

194
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,800
We're trying to rebuild
our shattered culture...

195
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,100
...after you raped our land
and defiled our women.

196
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,300
As long as you're not using it for firewater.

197
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,000
Look, a bow tie.

198
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,500
l'm David Bowie.

199
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,500
Bo Derek!

200
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Very funny!
Now tell the one that doesn't suck!

201
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,100
Thank you. Yes.
And what's the deal with airline food?

202
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Thanks, ''Watches You Pee.''

203
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,600
Where's your mother?

204
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,100
Over there.

205
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,600
l didn't know you knew how to play poker.

206
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
-Yeah.
-How you doing?

207
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,700
-Yeah.
-That's good, honey. Let's go.

208
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,900
Yeah.

209
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,500
lt's funny. l never knew video poker
could be so much fun.

210
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,200
You win a few hands
and all those lights go off.

211
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,700
And you just feel so good inside.

212
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,100
Yeah, gambling is great.
No question about it.

213
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,800
lt felt so good. l kept putting my money in.

214
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,200
And before l knew it, l'd lost $40.
l'm so embarrassed.

215
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,500
That's okay.
As long as you learned your lesson.

216
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,300
l did, Peter, for a couple of minutes.
Then....

217
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,200
This is so silly. l started playing again.

218
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,600
l could swear l parked here.

219
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,200
Yeah, you did.
But here's the really silly thing, Peter.

220
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,200
l sort of bet our car.

221
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,200
l won't panic.
l need to go back in the casino...

222
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,000
...and find a high roller who'll pay
$1 million to sleep with my wife.

223
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,000
What? That's ridiculous!

224
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,100
These people took $24
for the island of Manhattan.

225
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,900
They have no idea what things are worth!

226
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,900
Nice going, Mom.

227
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,800
l finally get my driver's license
and you lose the car to a poker machine.

228
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,200
How ironic.

229
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,600
Don't talk about your mother that way.
She is not an iron.

230
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,800
We gotta figure out a way
to get to New York...

231
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,500
...and get Chris back into the Scouts.

232
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,900
But Dad--

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,300
l got it.
l'll just get Brian to wire us some money.

234
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,900
Damn it, JuIie!
I am not shacking up with my boyfriend.

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,300
I am just going away for the weekend.

236
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,800
SCHNElDER: Yeah. AII the away.

237
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,100
Damn, Schneider! What won't you say?

238
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,100
No answer at the house.
You didn't bet that, too, did you?

239
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,300
l'm sorry, Peter. l feel so foolish.

240
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,700
lt just seemed like such a good cause.

241
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,300
Everyone in the tribe gets a share
in the casino's profits.

242
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,300
-What did you just say?
-''l'm sorry.''

243
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,600
-After that.
-''l feel foolish.''

244
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,900
-After that.
-''Casino's profits.''

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,400
-Before that.
-''Everyone in the tribe.''

246
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,300
-The whole thing.
-''Everyone in the tribe shares the profit?''

247
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
That's it! Let's go!

248
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,900
l'm sorry to hear about your misfortune.

249
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,200
But we're not allowed
to return gambling losses.

250
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,200
l think you can make an exception
in our case, Lenny. See, l'm an lndian, too.

251
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
LENNY AND LOlS: Excuse me?

252
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,100
You heard me. l'm a member of your tribe.

253
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,800
And that entitles me to a share
of your wampum, kemosabe.

254
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,000
Whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast.
Tell me of your history, of your past.

255
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,700
l come from a long line of you people.

256
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,700
My great-grandfather's name
was Jeep Grand Cherokee.

257
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,000
l mean, Chief Grand Cherokee.
He was a rainmaker.

258
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,000
''l'm so happy doing the neutron dance

259
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,000
''l'm just burning doing the neutron dance''

260
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,700
And he also killed a bunch of Krauts
at Wounded Knee.

261
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,400
So are you gonna
give me back my car, or what?

262
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
l have to confer with the council
of the elders. You wait here.

263
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,500
Are you nuts, Peter?
You'll never get away with this.

264
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,400
Why not? l've fooled people before.

265
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,600
You remember that time
l pretended to be gay?

266
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,800
There is no way
they're gonna believe you're an lndian.

267
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,100
He's an lndian.

268
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,000
How do you know?

269
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,900
-l can tell.
-You think everyone's an lndian.

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,100
He could just be another moocher.

271
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
Maybe we can put him through a test.

272
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,200
Like a really impossible stunt
to prove he's the real deal.

273
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,500
Way to think outside the box, Frank.

274
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,600
To prove you are truly a member
of our tribe, you must go on a vision quest.

275
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,100
Do you know what a vision quest is?

276
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,000
Of course l do. l'm an lndian.
But why don't you explain it to my wife?

277
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,900
She's a little slow in the head.

278
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
A vision quest is a sacred spiritual journey.

279
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Your husband must go out
in the wilderness without food or water.

280
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,800
-Or shoes.
-Yeah. Or shoes.

281
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,700
He must remain there
until he can communicate with nature.

282
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,400
He must hear the wisdom
of the rocks and trees.

283
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,000
And then his guiding spirit
must appear to him...

284
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
...and reveal a great personal truth.

285
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,400
And it's gotta be a real vision.

286
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
We're lndians.
We're gonna know if he's lying.

287
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Sucker.

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,900
LOlS: Peter, please don't do this.
We can buy another car.

289
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,700
l'll give extra piano lessons on Sundays.

290
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,500
Come on.
All l gotta do is have a spiritual vision.

291
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,300
l've had one before.

292
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,600
Oh, my God, Brian.
There's a message in my Alpha Bits.

293
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,300
lt says ''Ooooo.''

294
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
Peter, those are Cheerios.

295
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,300
You must begin your journey now.

296
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,000
-Now's your chance to be alone with Dad.
-Are you nuts? l'm not attracted to Dad.

297
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,000
-Tell him you don't want to be in Scouts.
-Thanks, Meg.

298
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Yipes.

299
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,000
Dad, can l come?

300
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,500
-How about it, Lenny?
-What the hey? The more the merrier.

301
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,400
Now get the hell out of here, you nut,
and go have yourself a spiritual vision.

302
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,400
Water! Thank God!

303
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,100
CHRlS: Dad, l'm hungry. Are we gonna die?
Of course not.

304
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,000
This isn't the first time
l found my own food in the wild.

305
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Dumb broad.

306
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,100
They've been gone for over six hours.

307
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,500
How long do these vision quests
usually take?

308
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,600
lt varies.

309
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,100
lt depends on the person's age,
and height, and sign.

310
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,800
You have no idea, do you?

311
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,000
Of course l.... No.

312
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,300
Why would you send
my husband and son out...

313
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,200
...into the wilderness without
any food or supplies?

314
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,600
Because we really like your car?

315
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,500
They're dead, you know.

316
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,200
Must eat. Haven't snacked in hours.

317
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Can't feel my eyes.

318
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,500
Wonder if club-footed midgets
get justice in heaven.

319
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,300
Hot enough for you?

320
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
What?

321
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,300
l say, ''Hot enough for you?''

322
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Yeah. l guess. Oh, my God!
l'm communicating with nature!

323
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,900
Tree, if one of you falls and there's
no one around, do you make a noise?

324
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,700
Are you kidding? Scott fell last week.

325
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,400
-He hasn't shut up about it since.
-Sure. Stand there and bitch!

326
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,300
But would any of you take the time
to help me?

327
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,300
l'm playing
the world's smallest violin, Scott.

328
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,700
FONZlE: Yo, Griffin!

329
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,100
The Fonz!

330
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,800
What are you doing here?

331
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,400
Shouldn't you be in the middle
of a Tuscadero sandwich?

332
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah. But l'm your spiritual guide, see?

333
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,200
l want to lay a little personal truth on you.

334
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,500
Now, Mr. C was like a father to me.

335
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,700
And he always listened, you know?

336
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,500
And Griffin, right now, your son needs
you to listen to him. Whoa!

337
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,000
Sure. Whatever you say. Fonzie?

338
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,000
There's something l always wanted
to ask you. You were with a lot of girls.

339
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,200
-Did you ever get a sexual disease?
-Herpes twice. And the clap.

340
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,400
Dad? Can l talk to you?

341
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,900
Not now, son!

342
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,900
Sure. Go right ahead.

343
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,100
Sure. Go right ahead.

344
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,200
l don't want to be a Scout, Dad.
l just don't have fun there.

345
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,500
-l guess you're pretty disappointed in me.
-Yeah!

346
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,900
-Dad, this is what l really like to do.
-What? You want to draw?

347
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Son, why don't you
just stick a knife in my heart?

348
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,600
-l mean, so you drew this?
-Yeah. l know they suck.

349
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,000
Not all of them.
Some of these look pretty good.

350
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,900
-Really?
-Yeah!

351
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,500
l didn't know anyone in this family
had any talent.

352
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,100
Except for that one thing
your mother does.

353
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,300
-You mean play the piano?
-No. She.... Yeah.

354
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,900
l probably don't say this often enough.

355
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,400
But l'm really proud of you, Chris.

356
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,600
Thanks, Dad.

357
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,400
''And the cat's in the cradle
with the silver spoon

358
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,200
''little boy blue and the man in the moon

359
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,800
''When you coming home, Dad?
l don't know when

360
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,600
''But we'll get together then, son
You know we'll have a--''

361
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh, my God!

362
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
Fire!

363
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,800
Let's get out of here!

364
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,400
Run, you stupid bastards!

365
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,000
Peter? Chris? Thank God. Are you okay?

366
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,900
Fantastic, Lois! l saw my guiding spirit.

367
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,100
Whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision?

368
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,500
lt was amazing! l spoke to the trees.
And l saw the Fonz.

369
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,000
Really? What's the Fonz like?
l bet he's stuck up.

370
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,700
A little. But thanks to him,
me and Chris have never been closer.

371
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,200
l want a spiritual vision, too! Man!

372
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,000
l guess we've lost touch
with our noble roots.

373
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,300
l mean, sure this casino's brought
our tribe money and prosperity.

374
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,100
-But what is the price of our souls?
-$6 million a week.

375
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,800
That sounds right.
Take your crappy car back.

376
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,000
Come on, boys. Let's go hit the buffet.

377
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,800
All right! We did it!
Let's get the hell out of here.

378
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,600
Stupid, greedy savages!

379
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,600
Stewie, that's a terrible thing to say.

380
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,400
This one particular tribe has lost their way.

381
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,100
But most Native Americans are proud...

382
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,000
...hardworking people
who are true to their spiritual heritage.

383
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,300
They are certainly not savages.

384
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,900
That's funny, Mother.

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,300
Just this morning you said they were lazy
like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding.

386
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,400
The Mexicans are a clean and industrious
people with a rich cultural heritage.

387
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,600
Yeah. Not like those dumb,
gargantuan Swedes.

388
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,200
Actually, the Swedish people run
the gamut from very short to tall.

389
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,100
And did you know that Sweden gave us
the brilliant inventor, Alfred Nobel?

390
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,200
Yeah. Which is more than we ever got
from those freeloading Canadians.

391
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,200
Canada sucks.
