1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,500
Come on, everyone.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,900
The Eight is Enough reunion show
is about to start.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,200
Mary, have you seen Nicholas?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,200
He's up in his room sulking, Dad.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,900
Yeah. He's still upset
because Abby threw out his baseball cards.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,300
Maybe I should make him a sandwich.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,600
Dad. That's your solution to everything.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,300
Dad!

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
What?

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,100
Eight is enough.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
You know, I love you girls.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,300
"It seems today that all you see

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,700
"is violence in movies and sex on TV

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,400
"But where are those good,
old-fashioned values

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
"on which we used to rely?

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,200
"Lucky there's a family guy

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,100
"Lucky there's a man who'll
positively tell you

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,700
"all the things that make us

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,300
"laugh 'n' cry

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,300
"He's a family guy"

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,700
Splendid.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,200
That hausfrau's cheap rayon blouses
will make a serviceable parachute...

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,900
...should I need to abandon
my jet in mid-flight.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
Once it's built, of course.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,000
Rupert, did you call that engineer
at Lockheed yet?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,700
No, of course you didn't,
you worthless little...

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,200
There! See what you made me do?
Do you think I enjoy hitting you?

28
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,200
Actually, I do.
I enjoy it so much I'm going to do it again!

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,300
Stewie! My clothes are not for you
to play with, understand?

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,200
Thanks for telling me, Brian.

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,900
I don't know what we'd do without you.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,900
I'm on to you. Your pathetic attempts to
hinder my work have not gone unnoticed.

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,200
You prance about this house
like the cock of the walk.

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,200
But will you be prancing
when there's nothing to prance about?

35
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,900
Will you be prancing then?

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
You just want to eat him up.

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,400
It is so hot out there!

38
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,000
How hot is it?

39
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,600
I don't know. Like, around 98, 99.

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,600
I don't get it.

41
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,300
I think I'm a little sweaty.

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,000
You! You seem to know all the players
in this poorly-acted farce.

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,800
What do they call that one?

44
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,200
That's Meg, dude. You know that.

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,300
Meg! You vile-smelling girl,
you're not to touch any of my things!

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,000
You understand me? Dirty girl.

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,300
Meanwhile, here at home...

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,100
...Quahog remains in the sweltering grip
of a freak heat wave.

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,500
I don't think you should use
the word "freak".

50
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Some people might find it offensive.

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
- Finish your oatmeal, son.
- Why bother? I'm just a freak!

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,400
We're all a little different, Diane.
Each of us.

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Good point.

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,000
We're even feeling the effects
of this heat wave here in our studio.

55
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,900
Freak.
So stay inside and stay cool.

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
I think I saw one of her nipples!

57
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Chris, that's a terrible word! "Nipple."

58
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,800
I'll chalk that up to the heat, mister.

59
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,700
Am I to strut about all day like
a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta?

60
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,900
Fetch me something linen to throw on
before I call Child Services!

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,200
Please don't threaten Mommy.
She's very hot.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,700
Chris, you're hogging up all the fans!

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,300
Yeah? You're hogging up all the ugly!

64
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,000
Check this out, you guys.

65
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,100
The Rhode Island Dog Show
Championship is in Quahog this year!

66
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,900
- First prize is $500!
- Really?

67
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,600
If you won, we could use that money
for a new air conditioner.

68
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,400
Brian. You could win for sure.

69
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,400
You could do your impression
of a barbershop quartet.

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,600
"We were sailing along

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,800
"On Moonlight Bay

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,500
"We could hear the voices singing

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,600
"They seemed to say"

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Sorry. I don't do dog shows.
It's not my thing.

75
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,600
Come on.
All you gotta do is a few simple commands.

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,000
And maybe a trick or two.
It'll be like taking candy from a baby.

77
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Please, Brian.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know. I mean
I don't even know where my papers are.

79
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,000
Can't you get the money another way?

80
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,800
I've been trying.
That's why I went on that game show.

81
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,800
For $800, this chemical dye is found
in over 95% of all cosmetic products.

82
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Diarrhea.

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,000
What?

84
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,400
Sorry. What is Diarrhea?

85
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,100
Come on, Brian.
We really need a new air conditioner.

86
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay, let's go over the commands.

87
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Sit.

88
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,500
Good. Roll over.

89
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,500
I'm already shvitzing like crazy here.
Let's call it a night.

90
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,200
Do you want to win this thing or not?

91
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,000
We haven't even talked
about how you'll wear your ears.

92
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,700
I was thinking up.

93
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
I need a cocktail.

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,300
Don't push too hard, Peter.

95
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,200
You gotta take Brian's feelings
into consideration.

96
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,500
After all, it's only a dog show.

97
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,000
Lois, honey, I love you...

98
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,700
...but you're sucking all the energy
out of the room.

99
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
Come.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,500
I got you a little something for the show.

101
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,200
It's Italian. Do you like it?

102
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
It's exquisite.

103
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,000
It's not for every day.

104
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,300
Clearly. I'm gonna put it on right now.

105
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,300
I know how hard you've been working.

106
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,100
And the whole family appreciates it.

107
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,500
Thank you, Lois.

108
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,100
I should go. We'll be waiting downstairs
whenever you're ready.

109
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
And Brian...

110
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,200
...you look very handsome.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
Showtime!

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,500
Welcome to the Quahog Dog
Show. Today's competition will be...

113
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,100
...almost as hot as the weather,
which is once again in the triple digits.

114
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,000
...almost as hot as the weather,
which is once again in the triple digits.

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Peter, I'm not really comfortable
with all this.

116
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,800
Do I know you?

117
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,300
I don't think I can do this.

118
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
You can't back out now. How about a pill?

119
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,800
- Something to relax you before you go on?
- Peter, are you offering Brian drugs?

120
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,800
Not drugs. Just a little blue thing
celebrities take to help them perform.

121
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Well, those celebrities are wrong!

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Lois, if Liza is wrong,
then I don't want to know what right is.

123
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,700
Two minutes to curtain, Miss Minnelli!

124
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Come on, baby! Mama's gotta sparkle!
It's time to make life a cabaret!

125
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,800
Lady, for God's sake, I'm just
a hard-shelled chocolate candy! Get help!

126
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,900
You there, child-woman!

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,300
I'll give you a shiny dime
if you'll roll me into the nearest lake.

128
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,500
Let me see if I can find you a juice box.

129
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,500
And get the lead out, pudgy!

130
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,200
Next, Peter Griffin and his dog, "Brain".

131
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
We're off to a good start.

132
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,200
A beautiful performance
from "Brain" Griffin!

133
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,600
Go, Brian!

134
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,800
All right, Brian. We got it all sewn up.

135
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,300
What the hell is this?

136
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,600
This? This is the part
where you beg for a treat.

137
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,300
I don't think so.

138
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,700
Brian, you're embarrassing me.

139
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,300
God, he can't expect Brian to do that.

140
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
It's easier than it looks, Mom.

141
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,400
Come on, Brian. We had a deal.

142
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah? The deal's off.

143
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,200
Me and the little shred of dignity I have left
will be waiting in the car!

144
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,900
Brian, come! Don't you walk out on me!

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
I now command you to leave.

146
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,300
Keep going. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, flip me off. Good boy.

147
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,300
How could you let me down
like that, Brian?

148
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,100
I let you down?
Because I refused to demean myself...

149
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,900
...by perpetuating the stereotype
of the good dog?

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,700
This is the one thing I ever asked you
to do for us.

151
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,200
This and not do that thing where you
drag your ass across the carpet.

152
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,900
One time I did that!

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,400
Peter, Brian, please.

154
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,100
Let's just have a nice family car ride
like we always do.

155
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,900
Yeah.
Except for the time Dad hit that deer.

156
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,900
Yeah, it looks like it's just a ding.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,600
There's no reason to involve
the insurance companies.

158
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,900
I should still take down your information.

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,300
Really? You could probably just
buff that out.

160
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,700
Yeah, but I...

161
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,100
I would really feel better
if I got your information.

162
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,700
Brian, maybe I had you pegged wrong.

163
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,100
Maybe you really don't care
about this family.

164
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,700
If you cared about me, you'd never
ask me to do something so degrading.

165
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,400
The next time I ask you to do something,
I expect you to do it. Understand?

166
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,700
Who wants to sing show tunes? "In old..."

167
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Stop the car.

168
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,300
Is that what you want?
Because I'll stop.

169
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,100
Pull over now.
Fine.

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,400
God. Brian, don't do this.

171
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,700
Is the doggie going bye-bye? I'm so sad.

172
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Quick! Back up!

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,400
Great. Is there a problem, Officer?

174
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,400
Can I see your license, boy?

175
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
"Boy"?

176
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
Oh, God. I left it on my other collar.

177
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,700
- You been chasing cars tonight, boy?
- Look, the name is Brian.

178
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,000
- I was just out for a little walk. That's all.
- Without a leash.

179
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,500
I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down
on the sidewalk. Down!

180
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,900
I don't believe this.

181
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,500
I don't suppose you could let us off
with a warning?

182
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,300
Sorry, sir.
But leash laws are for his own good.

183
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,500
The fine is $10.
You behave, little fella, you hear me?

184
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,800
Lordy, I'll never roam again!

185
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Jackass.

186
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,600
He's the law outside this house
just like I'm the law inside this house.

187
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,600
- And you better start obeying both of us.
- Look at you.

188
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,300
Big man, can't even afford to buy
an air conditioner for your family.

189
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,900
What a bitch.

190
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,500
Good morning Quahog.
The heat wave has finally broken.

191
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,500
It sure has. You know what they say,
"If you don't like...

192
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,400
"...the weather in New England,
go back where you came from."

193
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,400
I don't think that's the expression.

194
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,400
I guess I had too many
bloody marys this morning. But anyway...

195
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,800
God. I hope the boss isn't watching.

196
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,300
I don't know how those two manage
to be so perky in the morning.

197
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,700
Something smells good.

198
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,500
Homemade cinnamon buns
fresh from the tube.

199
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,200
Nothing says "I love you"
like something from...

200
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,400
What the hell are you doing,
you crazy bitch?

201
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,700
These oughta cheer Brian up.
Cinnamon buns are his favorite.

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,900
Really?

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
I could've sworn his favorite was
"treat Peter like crap" buns.

204
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,000
Good morning, Brian.

205
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,100
My, your summer coat is really
coming in nicely. Isn't it, Peter?

206
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,800
Yeah. Must be that special jojoba shampoo
I bought you. It cost a little extra.

207
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,700
But I would do anything for you, Brian.

208
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,400
I'll be on the veranda
since you're already on the cross.

209
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,200
Eat with us, Brian. I made cinnamon buns.

210
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,800
May I have one on a plate or is
Peter planning to balance it on my nose?

211
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,700
Peter, Brian, stop this.

212
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
Can't you two go back to the way
you used to be?

213
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,000
We can't go back to the way things were
after how I was treated.

214
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,800
- Not after the things I've seen.
- What did you see? Was it breasts?

215
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,300
Get over it, Brian.
I mean, how bad do you really have it here?

216
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,300
- When I found you, you were just a stray.
- You swore you would never speak of that.

217
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,500
No, thank you. I just had it cleaned.

218
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,500
No. Jeez.

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
All set, sir.

220
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,300
I don't have any change. Sorry.

221
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,500
That's okay. No charge.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Wait.

223
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,900
You hungry?

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,900
Because my wife makes
this beef-a-roni casserole.

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,100
Out of this world.

226
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,200
Look, you got everything
you could possibly want right here.

227
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,000
Now just eat your cinnamon bun
and stop being a bad dog.

228
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,800
How dare you?

229
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,200
How dare I?
Where do you think you're going?

230
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,200
Out!

231
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,400
You're not going anywhere
without your leash!

232
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
I don't need your damn leash, or you!

233
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,300
I'm going for a walk.

234
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,400
Don't worry. He won't get far without this.

235
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,600
And a pack of Eldorados, unfiltered.

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What? That. Yeah.
I'll clean that up on my way out.

237
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,800
See that sign?

238
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,100
Now why don't you go tie yourself
up to that parking meter?

239
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't want any trouble.

240
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,800
Mom, have you ever had
a problem with freshness?

241
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,200
What do you mean, honey?

242
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,200
You know. Have you ever felt not so fresh?

243
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm not sure what you're...
I don't follow you.

244
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,400
Have you ever felt like you're dirty?

245
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
Down there?

246
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,300
God, no!

247
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,300
That was Brian's favorite commercial.

248
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,600
"Brian"? No, it's not ringing a bell.

249
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Stop it! We all miss him.

250
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,600
Go find him, apologize,
and bring him home.

251
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,600
You heard him.
He doesn't want to be a part of this family.

252
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,700
We don't need him. We'll get another pet.

253
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,600
No way, Dad.
No one can take Brian's place.

254
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,900
Silence!

255
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,200
That mongrel is probably decomposing
on the side of a dirt road as we speak!

256
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,700
- Let's get a kitty!
- See, gang? Stewie's got the right idea.

257
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,200
- I don't know, Peter.
- Lois, trust me.

258
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,600
We'll get a lovable kitty-cat
and everybody will feel a lot better.

259
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,000
Here, kitty, kitty.
Come on down nice and easy.

260
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,400
That's a good kitty.

261
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,800
What the hell was that?

262
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,800
Something near a window.
Preferably a booth.

263
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,200
Yeah, you got 50 Puerto Ricans
in the kitchen!

264
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,400
Yeah, that's authentic Italian.

265
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,200
Don't do that.
That's what they expect you to do.

266
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,900
Okay, fine for you.
But what about your puppies?

267
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,600
And your puppies' puppies?
Am I the only one who's outraged here?

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,200
I'm sorry. Enjoy your dinner.

269
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,500
How come you're still setting
a place for Brian?

270
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,400
Because when he comes home, I want
him to know he never left our thoughts.

271
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,700
I know you're thinking about him,
too, Peter.

272
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,100
Look, Lois, he broke his promise to me.
Besides, we have a new pet.

273
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,400
And we love our fluffy kitty.

274
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,100
Gross. Did he just drink from the fountain?

275
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,500
Hey, you!

276
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
Stay!

277
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,800
Joyce DeWitt?
So that's where you've been.

278
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,200
Sorry, pooch. You gotta sleep outside.
No dogs allowed in the bus station.

279
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,100
My blind guy's in the john.

280
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,500
I'll point him in your direction.

281
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,200
Brian's tennis ball.

282
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Man, he loved to play with this thing.

283
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,700
Double fault!

284
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,500
Come on, Brian.

285
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Peter, why don't you
just admit you miss Brian?

286
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,100
You're right, Lois. Who am I kidding?
This family needs Brian. I need him.

287
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,600
God, I hate this freaking cat.

288
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,600
Can you spare some change?

289
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,800
Why? So you can go buy yourself
another bottle of booze?

290
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,800
Why don't you make something
of your life, like this dog?

291
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,600
That's me! I mean, that was me.

292
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,800
Yeah, sure.

293
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,400
No, I mean it. That was me.

294
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,300
Get away from me, you crazy animal!

295
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,700
You want me to be a crazy animal?
Okay, I'm a crazy animal!

296
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,400
Stop! Help!

297
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,700
Help!

298
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,300
All right, who wants to be next?
You? You?

299
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,300
Brian!

300
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,300
I'm here to bring you...

301
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,300
You're going downtown, pal.

302
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
...home.

303
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,400
Hi. How's it going?

304
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,700
Oh, God. I know karate!

305
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,300
Look! A tasty little baby!

306
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,100
I see somebody's been neutered.

307
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,600
Come on, sugar. It's time.

308
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,000
Thank God.

309
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,500
He's cute. Aren't you precious?
Lethal injection. Next!

310
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
- What?
- Oh, no!

311
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,900
You can't do this!

312
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,500
Who's up for a little lunch?
Something festive.

313
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,000
Did someone say Tex-Mex?

314
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,700
I'm sorry, sugar.

315
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
Help me.

316
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,400
Don't worry. I'll get you out of this.

317
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
I'll get us the best help there is.

318
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,800
"Dear MacGuyver...

319
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,600
"Enclosed is a rubber band, a paper clip,
and a drinking straw.

320
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,400
"Please save my dog."

321
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
You're looking well.

322
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,200
Don't get too close.
They say I'm dangerous.

323
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,500
That's why the man's gonna put me down.

324
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,700
Don't say that, Brian.
Peter is working on your appeal.

325
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,900
You'll see. Everything's gonna work out.

326
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I may have been born with my eyes closed,
but now I see the world for what it is.

327
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,300
I'm a second-class citizen, Lois.

328
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,300
Great news!
The City Council agreed to hear your case!

329
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,900
You're kidding! If I prepare
my case, I might have a chance after all.

330
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,600
I don't know how to thank you.

331
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,900
We're family.
This is what we do for each other.

332
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,700
Right, Peter?

333
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,500
Peter, don't stare!

334
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,100
Good luck, sweetness.

335
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,300
Thanks, Felicia.

336
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,900
This meeting was called...

337
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,200
...to review the judgment
in City of Quahog v. Brian Griffin.

338
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,900
Justice, for all? Or for some?

339
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,500
Does a dog not feel?

340
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
If you scratch him, does his leg not shake?

341
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,600
Yes, he is man's best friend.
But what manner of friend is man?

342
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,100
I would like to cite the case of
Plessy v. Ferguson...

343
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,600
Wait a minute.
Why are we listening to a dog?

344
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Take him away!

345
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
Does not every dog have his day?

346
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,700
Wait! Please! I gotta say something!

347
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,200
Look, all Brian's ever wanted
is the same respect he gives us.

348
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,800
That and Snausages.
He's mental for those Snausages.

349
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,400
And sure, sometimes we have arguments,
like when he's sleeping on the bed and...

350
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
...Lois is in the "oodmay"
but Brian won't "amscray."

351
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,900
- Peter...
- Okay.

352
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,700
Look. The point is, he's a member
of our family first and a dog second.

353
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,000
And I'm real sorry I forgot that, buddy.

354
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,600
Sometimes we all need a second chance.

355
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,600
Sometimes we all need to forgive!

356
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,300
I stole $10 from Meg's room!

357
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,500
I stole $10 from Mom's purse!

358
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,200
I've been making counterfeit $10 bills
for years.

359
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,200
Mr. Griffin, this dog is a danger to society.

360
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,100
Albeit an articulate and charismatic one.

361
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,400
But the law is the law and can't
be circumvented by pretty words.

362
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,900
I'll give you each $20.

363
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,500
Deal. He can go.

364
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,000
Mistrial, damn you! Mistrial!

365
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,000
No. Let him go.

366
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,400
Anybody want more pizza rolls?

367
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Yeah. Quiet, Lois. Murder She Wrote.

368
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,400
Charles Montrose, after all these years.

369
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,400
Jessica Fletcher!
Why I haven't seen you since you had the...

370
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,800
You can say it, Charles.
I'm not ashamed. Abortion.

371
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,600
So she's the murderer!

372
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
Come on, kids. Bedtime.

373
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,600
Good night, Brian. And welcome home.

374
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,000
Good night, you guys.
Good night.

375
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,000
- Dog?
- Yeah?

376
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,200
If you ever tell anyone about that,
I will kill you.
