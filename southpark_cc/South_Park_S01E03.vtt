# I'm going down to South Park #

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:36.828
# Gonna have myself a time #

00:01:36.953 --> 00:01:38.496
Both: # Friendly
faces everywhere #

00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:40.123
# Humble folks
without temptations #

00:01:40.248 --> 00:01:41.541
# I'm going down to South Park #

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.793
# Gonna leave my woes behind #

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:45.420
# Ample parking day or night #

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:47.130
# People spouting
"Howdy neighbor" #

00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:48.548
# Heading on up to South Park #

00:01:48.673 --> 00:01:50.300
# Gonna see if I can't unwind #

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:53.678
# [muffled singing] #

00:01:53.803 --> 00:01:55.180
# So come on
down to South park #

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:57.140
# And meet some friends
of mine #

00:01:57.265 --> 00:01:59.309
Now you be careful, Eric.

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:01.770
The woods can be very dangerous.

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:04.898
Okay, Mom.

00:02:05.023 --> 00:02:06.858
Ready to go hunting, Cartman?

00:02:06.983 --> 00:02:09.319
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says
we gotta get up there early.

00:02:09.444 --> 00:02:10.361
Right, Uncle Jimbo?

00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:12.155
That's right, Stanley.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.282
Animals are much easier
to shoot in the morning.

00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:15.784
Here, hon.

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.328
I packed you Cheesy Poofs
and Happy Tarts.

00:02:18.453 --> 00:02:20.872
Don't worry, Miss Cartman,
we'll take care of him.

00:02:20.997 --> 00:02:24.000
I brought my old war buddy,
Ned, to keep things safe.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:27.670
Hello, Mrs. Cartman.
How are you today?

00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:29.923
Be sure to use
lots of bug spray,

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:31.508
and if you have
to poo-poo,

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:33.676
don't wipe with poison ivy.

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:36.304
[laughter]
Dude, that's sick, Mom!

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.474
And I know it can get scary
up in those woods,

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.311
but just remember,
Mommy's not far away.

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:45.730
[laughter]
Drive! Drive!

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:47.857
You give your mommy a kissy.

00:02:47.982 --> 00:02:49.776
Drive the car, damn it!
Drive!

00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:54.155
"Don't get scared up
in the mountains, Cartman."

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.407
Shut up!
I'm not scared of nothing.

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:59.035
Maybe your mom can give me
a kiss too, Cartman.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.578
[muffled speech]

00:03:00.703 --> 00:03:03.665
Oh, oh!
That's disgusting.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.834
You piece of crap!
I'll kill you!

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.502
That's the spirit, boys.

00:03:07.627 --> 00:03:09.671
Let's get that
testosterone flowing.

00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:11.506
Yeeh!

00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:13.842
Now, boys, boys, I need
to get serious for a minute.

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:16.928
I want you to understand
a few basic rules of hunting,

00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:18.638
since this is your first time.

00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:20.807
First of all, don't
ever walk with your gun

00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:22.517
unless the safety's on.

00:03:22.642 --> 00:03:24.853
Second, don't shoot anything
that looks human.

00:03:24.978 --> 00:03:27.689
And third, never spill your
beer in the bullet chamber.

00:03:27.814 --> 00:03:30.024
Uh, Uncle Jimbo,
we don't drink beer.

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:31.109
You what?!

00:03:31.234 --> 00:03:32.735
Yeah, that's right,

00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:34.988
I don't think eight-year-old
kids drink beer.

00:03:35.113 --> 00:03:36.990
I like chocolate milk!

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:39.492
Well, we'll be doing plenty
of drinking on this trip.

00:03:39.617 --> 00:03:42.662
After all,
hunter sober is like...

00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:44.956
Fishing... sober.

00:03:45.081 --> 00:03:47.125
It sure will be nice
to get out of the city

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.294
for a while,
away from civilization.

00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:56.134
Well, here we are.

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:59.512
Okay, each of you young'uns
take a gun, a beer,

00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:01.472
and some smokes.

00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:04.517
Hey, I didn't get a gun.

00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:07.562
Sweet. This is like
the gun I used in 'Nam.

00:04:07.687 --> 00:04:09.355
You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.608
Were you stationed in Da Nang?

00:04:11.733 --> 00:04:13.026
Cartman always
makes stuff up, Ned.

00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:14.611
You can't believe
anything he says.

00:04:14.736 --> 00:04:16.571
Hey, I'll blow
your freaking head off.

00:04:16.696 --> 00:04:19.073
Hey, look out, son.
That's dangerous.

00:04:19.198 --> 00:04:20.950
You're gonna spill your beer.

00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:27.415
My Uncle Jimbo
says that after this

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.292
he's gonna take me
hunting in Africa.

00:04:29.417 --> 00:04:31.210
Wow, that'll be cool.

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:34.881
My mom says there's a lot
of black people in Africa.

00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:36.549
Boys, lookie there.

00:04:36.674 --> 00:04:38.968
That there is
a Rocky Mountain black bear.

00:04:39.093 --> 00:04:40.511
One of the few remaining
of its kind.

00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:42.680
Isn't it beautiful?

00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:44.599
My God,
it's coming right for us!

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:49.812
Hey, it wasn't
coming right for us.

00:04:49.938 --> 00:04:52.273
It was just sitting there.
Shh, not so loud.

00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:54.317
Now that there
is just a technicality.

00:04:54.442 --> 00:04:55.985
What do you mean?
You see, boys,

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.987
the Democrats have passed
a lot of laws

00:04:58.112 --> 00:04:59.572
trying to stop us from hunting.

00:04:59.697 --> 00:05:01.324
Democrats piss me off!

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.409
They say we can't shoot
certain animals anymore

00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:05.703
unless they're posing
an immediate threat.

00:05:05.828 --> 00:05:07.789
Therefore,
before we shoot something,

00:05:07.914 --> 00:05:10.333
we have to say,
"It's coming right for us."

00:05:10.458 --> 00:05:12.001
Wow, you're smart, Uncle Jimbo.

00:05:12.126 --> 00:05:14.170
Jimbo, look.

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:16.381
Oh, it's a deer.

00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:19.842
Looks like about
a 45-gauge, Ned.

00:05:19.968 --> 00:05:22.762
It's coming right for us!

00:05:25.515 --> 00:05:27.684
Kickass!

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:29.477
Did you see that?

00:05:29.602 --> 00:05:31.813
I was imperiled by
that ferocious, charging buck.

00:05:31.938 --> 00:05:34.565
Rabbit, rabbit, five o'clock.

00:05:35.984 --> 00:05:38.528
Let's move!
Move!

00:05:38.653 --> 00:05:40.697
Is this hunting?
I guess so.

00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:43.408
Uh, dude, I'm starting
to have flashbacks.

00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:45.827
What?
Stand forth, pull up flank.

00:05:45.952 --> 00:05:48.579
Look out for Charlies
up in the trees.

00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:54.585
This one's yours, Stan.

00:05:57.296 --> 00:06:00.425
It's coming right for us.
It's coming right for us.

00:06:04.178 --> 00:06:06.681
Shoot it, Stan.
I got your back, soldier.

00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:10.810
I can't.

00:06:10.935 --> 00:06:12.645
What the...
What's wrong with you?

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.230
I don't wanna shoot the bunny.

00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:15.690
What the hell
are you talking about,

00:06:15.815 --> 00:06:17.316
you don't wanna shoot the bunny?

00:06:17.442 --> 00:06:18.943
You're babbling,
you're not making any sense.

00:06:19.068 --> 00:06:20.445
You're hysterical.
I'm not hysterical.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.196
I just don't wanna
shoot the bunny.

00:06:22.321 --> 00:06:23.948
No nephew of mine
is gonna be a tree-hugger.

00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:25.742
Yeah, hippie,
go back to Woodstock

00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:27.618
if you can't shoot anything.

00:06:27.744 --> 00:06:29.912
I can shoot you, fatass!
I can shoot you, too!

00:06:30.038 --> 00:06:32.165
I'll kill you!
I'll fill you full of lead!

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.083
[rumbling]

00:06:34.208 --> 00:06:36.210

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:56.314
Yeah, Frank.
It's Randy.

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.691
Uh-huh. Good.

00:06:58.816 --> 00:07:01.778
Yeah, listen,
the little needle is moving.

00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:03.571
Yeah, it's going
back and forth really fast.

00:07:03.696 --> 00:07:06.491
What does that mean?
Uh-huh?

00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:10.286
Uh-huh.
Let me check.

00:07:10.411 --> 00:07:13.206
Yeah, it's smoking.
Uh-huh.

00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:17.418
Oh, really?
Really?

00:07:17.543 --> 00:07:20.505

This wood won't burn.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.855
Well, Ned, looks like
we'll have to use

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.482
the old Indian fire trick.

00:07:39.607 --> 00:07:41.484
Yep.

00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.960
God damn it, Ned.
I just got that van.

00:07:59.085 --> 00:08:01.045
How the hell are we
supposed to get home?

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.464
Oh, it hurts, it hurts!

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:05.591
Hey, you guys.

00:08:05.716 --> 00:08:07.552
This works pretty good
right now.

00:08:07.677 --> 00:08:10.346
But you see, Mr. Mayor,

00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:12.723
you can't stop serving
Salisbury steak

00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:14.308
in our public schools.

00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:16.269
What's next, meatloaf?

00:08:16.394 --> 00:08:19.355
We are quite aware
of your concerns, Chef, but...

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.691
<i>Mayor, the geologist
is here to see you.</i>

00:08:21.816 --> 00:08:23.818
My geologist? Now?

00:08:23.943 --> 00:08:25.194
Tell him the infection is fine

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:26.863
and I don't need
another checkup.

00:08:26.988 --> 00:08:28.823
<i>No, Mayor, that's
a gynecologist.</i>

00:08:28.948 --> 00:08:30.741
<i>A geologist studies the earth.</i>

00:08:30.867 --> 00:08:32.827
Don't you think I know that?

00:08:32.952 --> 00:08:34.704
How dare you insult
my intellect.

00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:36.664
I went to Princeton
for God's sake.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.291
You get out of my office.

00:08:38.416 --> 00:08:40.042
<i>I'm not in your office, Mayor.</i>

00:08:40.168 --> 00:08:43.379
<i>I'm talking to you
through a speaker.</i>

00:08:43.504 --> 00:08:45.965
Just send in the geometrist.
<i>Geologist.</i>

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.967
You are fired, buddy!

<i>Thank you, Mayor. It's
been great working for you.</i>

00:08:50.303 --> 00:08:52.513
Mayor, we've got
a very big problem.

00:08:52.638 --> 00:08:54.432

Well, this graph shows
everything from normal to bad.

Mayor, some of
the school children

00:09:21.584 --> 00:09:24.503
are up camping
on that mountain right now.

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:25.880
Oh, this is big.

00:09:26.005 --> 00:09:28.049
Johnson, Johnson, are you there?

00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:29.800
<i>Uh, you just fired
Johnson, Mayor.</i>

00:09:29.926 --> 00:09:31.427
<i>I'm his replacement, Ted.</i>

00:09:31.552 --> 00:09:33.596
Ted, we have got
a major crisis here.

00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:35.473
I want you to get
on the phone and call

00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:37.767
"Inside Edition," "Rescue 911,"

00:09:37.892 --> 00:09:39.602
oh, and
"Entertainment Tonight."

00:09:39.727 --> 00:09:41.771
You better get
my stylist on the phone, too.

00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:45.024
Don't worry.
Things are under control.

00:09:46.692 --> 00:09:50.321
And then Ned picked
up the grenade and... boom!

00:09:50.446 --> 00:09:52.240
Blasted his arm clear off.

00:09:52.365 --> 00:09:54.992
We spent three hours
looking for that damn arm,

00:09:55.117 --> 00:09:56.827
but it was never to be found.

00:09:56.953 --> 00:09:59.830
Some say it's still
crawling around to this day.

00:09:59.956 --> 00:10:01.457
[growls]

00:10:01.582 --> 00:10:03.584
[laughter]
Ha, gotcha!

00:10:03.709 --> 00:10:05.544
Heh, that's not scary.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.672
You were scared, Cartman.
You almost peed your pants.

00:10:07.797 --> 00:10:09.799
Shut up!
I didn't pee my pants.

00:10:09.924 --> 00:10:11.342
Hey, Ned, hand me that gin.

00:10:14.262 --> 00:10:16.180
You boys want to tie one on?

00:10:16.305 --> 00:10:18.266
No, no thanks.
That stuff tastes like pee.

00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:21.143
Yeah, Cartman's pee.
Hey, you would taste my pee.

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:22.520
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:10:22.645 --> 00:10:25.147
Can't you have a little alcohol?

00:10:26.649 --> 00:10:30.361
Christ, look at that
little bastard go!

00:10:30.486 --> 00:10:31.988
Now you see that, Stan?

00:10:32.113 --> 00:10:34.282
Now that is
a dirty little bastard.

00:10:34.407 --> 00:10:36.617
Hey, I'm a dirty
little bastard, too.

00:10:36.742 --> 00:10:39.161
Hey, you guys,
I know a scary story.

00:10:39.287 --> 00:10:41.622
Shut up, Cartman.
You can't scare anybody.

00:10:41.747 --> 00:10:43.207
Oh, yeah?

00:10:43.332 --> 00:10:46.085
You guys ever heard
of Scuzzlebutt?

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.336
What-lebutt?

00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:49.005
Scuzzlebutt is a creature

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.632
that lives up
on this very mountain

00:10:51.757 --> 00:10:55.011
and kills anybody
who dares climb to the top.

00:10:55.136 --> 00:10:56.637
Why?

00:10:56.762 --> 00:10:58.639
Because it loves
the taste of blood

00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:02.226
and likes to add pieces
to its deformed body.

00:11:02.351 --> 00:11:03.686
Deformed how?

00:11:03.811 --> 00:11:05.646
Well, on his left arm

00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:07.940
instead of a hand, he has...

00:11:08.065 --> 00:11:09.358
A hook.
A knife.

00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:12.611
No, a piece of celery.
Celery?

00:11:12.737 --> 00:11:14.655
Yes, and he walks with a limp,

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.074
because one of
his legs is missing.

00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:18.909
And where his leg should be,

00:11:19.035 --> 00:11:21.912
there's nothing but...
Patrick Duffy.

00:11:22.038 --> 00:11:24.123
Patrick Duffy?

00:11:24.248 --> 00:11:26.083
Damn it, Cartman,
that's not scary.

00:11:26.208 --> 00:11:28.461
What do you mean? Have you
ever seen "Step by Step?"

00:11:29.712 --> 00:11:31.505
So he lives alone
on this mountain

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.258
and weaves baskets
and other assorted crafts.

00:11:34.383 --> 00:11:36.135
They say that on quiet nights

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.554
you can hear him weaving
his baskets.

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:41.724
Ka-shink, ka-shink, ka-shink.

00:11:41.849 --> 00:11:44.101
Cartman, you suck
at telling scary stories.

00:11:44.226 --> 00:11:45.561
Yeah, give me that flashlight.

00:11:45.686 --> 00:11:46.562
[muffled speech]

00:11:46.687 --> 00:11:49.065
[rumbling]

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.691
What's that?
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt

00:11:50.816 --> 00:11:52.485
coming to weave us
into wicker baskets.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.320
Hey, it might be.

00:11:54.445 --> 00:11:57.073
Gosh, I hope he doesn't
cut me with his celery hand.

00:11:57.198 --> 00:11:58.366
[laughter]
Screw you guys!

00:11:58.491 --> 00:12:00.576
Fatass!
Go to hell!

00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:03.579
Hey, Ned, why don't you whip
out the old cancer kazoo.

00:12:03.704 --> 00:12:06.874
Let's do a little song.

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:09.418
# Kumbaya, my Lord #

00:12:09.543 --> 00:12:12.213
# Kumbaya #

00:12:12.338 --> 00:12:14.673
# Kumbaya, my Lord #

00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:17.009
# Kumbaya #

00:12:17.134 --> 00:12:19.387
# Kumbaya, my Lord #

00:12:19.512 --> 00:12:22.348
# Kumbaya #

00:12:22.473 --> 00:12:27.144
# Oh Lord, Kumbaya #

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:30.940
# Someone's crying, Lord,
Kumbaya #

00:12:31.065 --> 00:12:33.150
They don't think
Scuzzlebutt is scary, huh?

00:12:33.275 --> 00:12:34.652
Let's see how they like it

00:12:34.777 --> 00:12:36.987
when they actually
see Scuzzlebutt.

00:12:37.113 --> 00:12:38.864
I'll scare the hell
out of them tomorrow.

00:12:38.989 --> 00:12:42.660
# Someone's crying, Lord,
Kumbaya #

00:12:42.785 --> 00:12:46.247
# Oh Lord, Kumbaya #

00:12:48.082 --> 00:12:49.792
[rooster crows]

00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:51.836
Stan, Stan, wake up.

00:12:51.961 --> 00:12:53.337
What, dude?

00:12:53.462 --> 00:12:54.880
I don't know where Cartman is.

00:12:55.005 --> 00:12:56.173
I think something took him away.

00:12:56.298 --> 00:12:57.716
Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?

00:12:57.842 --> 00:12:59.635
They're out fishing with Kenny.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.596
With Kenny? But this is
supposed to be my camping trip.

00:13:02.721 --> 00:13:04.432
Why do they like Kenny so much?

00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:06.475
Doesn't he like me anymore?

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.561
Well, Stan, you want
to know what I think?

00:13:08.686 --> 00:13:10.688
What?
[farts]

00:13:12.565 --> 00:13:14.608
What a beautiful morning
for fishing.

00:13:14.733 --> 00:13:16.819
There's one.
There's a fish right there.

00:13:19.947 --> 00:13:21.532
Got it.

00:13:23.868 --> 00:13:25.244
Great instincts, boy.

00:13:25.369 --> 00:13:27.079
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing.

00:13:27.204 --> 00:13:29.331
Who?
The fat kid?

00:13:29.457 --> 00:13:31.459
Yeah.
Ah, hell.

00:13:31.584 --> 00:13:33.419
I guess we better
go look for him.

00:13:33.544 --> 00:13:34.837
Ned, you gotta cut it short.

00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:36.964
Fire out the 12-20.

00:13:41.427 --> 00:13:43.387
Well, I think
that's about the limit

00:13:43.512 --> 00:13:44.930
for our fishing permit.

00:13:45.055 --> 00:13:47.850
Oh, man, it smells
like dead fish.

00:13:47.975 --> 00:13:49.477
[muffled speech]

00:13:49.602 --> 00:13:52.396
Oh, man, that is nasty.

00:13:52.521 --> 00:13:54.732
Yeah, I don't think
I've ever seen a kid

00:13:54.857 --> 00:13:56.275
as cool as you, Kenny.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.819
I'm making you
my honorary nephew.

00:13:58.944 --> 00:13:59.820
[muffled speech]

00:13:59.945 --> 00:14:01.947
<i>[somber music]</i>

00:14:04.325 --> 00:14:07.453
The people of South Park
are humble and friendly,

00:14:07.578 --> 00:14:09.622
but now a ticking
time bomb of hot lava

00:14:09.747 --> 00:14:12.082
waits to engulf these people
and end their miserable lives

00:14:12.208 --> 00:14:13.709
with one last fleeting moment

00:14:13.834 --> 00:14:16.337
of excruciatingly painful,
burning agony.

00:14:16.462 --> 00:14:19.548
Hey, I'm on TV!
I'm on TV!

00:14:19.673 --> 00:14:21.258
Mayor, what are you doing

00:14:21.383 --> 00:14:23.135
to prepare for this
inevitable catastrophe?

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.097
All we know right now
is that some of our children

00:14:27.223 --> 00:14:30.559
are camping on that mountain
and... uh, I'm sorry.

00:14:30.684 --> 00:14:32.436
Can I start over?
Huh?

00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:36.232
You can edit this, right?
Ready? Three, two, one.

00:14:36.357 --> 00:14:37.983
All we know right now

00:14:38.108 --> 00:14:39.735
is that some of our children

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.820
are up camping on that mountain.

00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:44.657
We can't do anything
until we get them.

00:14:44.782 --> 00:14:49.703
Okay, people,
let's go get those kids!

00:14:49.828 --> 00:14:52.706
Come on, everybody.
You gotta help the children.

00:14:54.542 --> 00:14:56.961
Well, he couldn't have gone far.

00:14:57.086 --> 00:14:58.712
Unless something drug him off.

00:14:58.837 --> 00:15:02.466
There's not many animals
out today, Jimbo.

00:15:02.591 --> 00:15:05.511
Yeah, it's almost like
something funny's going on.

00:15:05.636 --> 00:15:08.138
[rumbling]

00:15:08.264 --> 00:15:10.140
Christ, Ned, what'd
you have for breakfast?

00:15:10.266 --> 00:15:13.310
I don't know, man.
I've got some bad gas.

00:15:13.435 --> 00:15:15.688
Wait, there's a ram.

00:15:15.813 --> 00:15:17.523
It's coming right for us!

00:15:20.943 --> 00:15:22.444
Nice shooting, Kenny!

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.738
Here, you need a bigger gun.

00:15:24.863 --> 00:15:27.783
Look!
I am Scuzzlebutt,

00:15:27.908 --> 00:15:29.577
Lord of the mountains.

00:15:29.702 --> 00:15:31.954
Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:33.747
What is it?

00:15:33.872 --> 00:15:35.833
Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt!
Cartman wasn't lying.

00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.877
Holy crow! We could make
a mint killing this thing.

00:15:39.003 --> 00:15:41.672
We'll be on the cover
of "Guns & Ammo."

00:15:41.797 --> 00:15:44.341
This calls for some HJ-14.

00:15:44.466 --> 00:15:47.261
[chuckles] Those guys
are totally scared.

00:15:47.386 --> 00:15:49.722
Fire in the hole!

00:15:51.432 --> 00:15:52.641
Holy crap!

00:15:55.144 --> 00:15:56.895
Damn it, I think I missed.

00:15:57.021 --> 00:15:59.315
What the hell
is wrong with you people?

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.483
Come on, let's move!
Move!

00:16:01.609 --> 00:16:04.403
Wait, wait, ahhh!

00:16:04.528 --> 00:16:06.071
Is it on?
Okay.

00:16:06.196 --> 00:16:08.991
Okay, people, form groups
and search the mountain.

00:16:09.116 --> 00:16:11.910
Report back here every hour.
You got that?

00:16:12.036 --> 00:16:15.080
Mayor, I might have an idea.
Oh, what?

00:16:15.205 --> 00:16:17.041
Well, if we can dig
a very large trench,

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:19.710
we can divert the lava
into a canyon,

00:16:19.835 --> 00:16:22.963
and then it would bypass South
Park pretty much completely.

00:16:23.088 --> 00:16:25.049
And that would be good, right?

00:16:25.174 --> 00:16:26.508
I'm pretty sure.

00:16:26.634 --> 00:16:28.594
Well, what are we waiting for?

00:16:28.719 --> 00:16:30.804
Okay, people, change of plans.

00:16:30.929 --> 00:16:32.890
Half of you grabs shovels.

00:16:33.015 --> 00:16:35.643
These look like his tracks.
He must have gone this way.

00:16:35.768 --> 00:16:38.729
Ned, prepare some HK-12
and some Plasticine.

00:16:38.854 --> 00:16:41.315
I'll bet that sucker is headed
for a higher elevation.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.401
The higher up it... bird!

00:16:44.526 --> 00:16:46.904
The higher up it goes,
the better it can breathe.

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:49.365
Look, up there!

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.201
You guys, it's just me.

00:16:52.326 --> 00:16:54.036
Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?

00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:55.996
Does it have
Patrick Duffy for a leg?

00:16:56.121 --> 00:16:57.831
I can't tell.
Let's kill it.

00:16:57.956 --> 00:17:00.793
Got to get out
of this stupid costume.

00:17:00.918 --> 00:17:02.378
Kenny, you take the front.

00:17:02.503 --> 00:17:04.129
No, I can do it, Uncle Jimbo.

00:17:04.254 --> 00:17:05.756
I want to bag that animal.

00:17:05.881 --> 00:17:08.425
That's the spirit, kiddo.
Let's hunt!

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.511
You guys, you guys,
I was just kidding!

00:17:10.636 --> 00:17:12.221
As some people of South Park

00:17:12.346 --> 00:17:13.931
try desperately
to save their mountain town,

00:17:14.056 --> 00:17:15.891
others look
for the missing townspeople.

00:17:16.016 --> 00:17:18.644
But all must take
every precaution necessary.

00:17:18.769 --> 00:17:20.729
Okay, people, listen up.

00:17:20.854 --> 00:17:23.023
As we near the top
of the mountain,

00:17:23.148 --> 00:17:26.819
the chances of our encountering
some lava becomes great.

00:17:26.944 --> 00:17:29.113
Therefore,
I have special ordered

00:17:29.238 --> 00:17:31.281
this training film to assist us

00:17:31.407 --> 00:17:33.283
in volcano safety.

00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:35.411
Mr. Garrison,
if you would, please.

00:17:35.536 --> 00:17:38.288
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

00:17:38.414 --> 00:17:40.666
Harbingers of sorrow,
natural disasters can be

00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:43.419
the cause of troubling
and undesirable stress,

00:17:43.544 --> 00:17:45.629
and a volcano is no exception.

00:17:45.754 --> 00:17:48.048
But what should you do
if a volcano erupts near you

00:17:48.173 --> 00:17:49.675
or your family?

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.635
<i>Here, we see the Stephens Family</i>

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.345

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.556
<i>But suddenly,
daughter hears a noise.</i>

00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:57.725
<i>It's a volcano.
Junior seems worried.</i>

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.393
<i>But have no fear, Junior.</i>

00:17:59.518 --> 00:18:00.936

<i>when you hear a volcano erupt.</i>

00:18:03.814 --> 00:18:06.358
<i>That's right, Jane,
duck and cover.</i>

00:18:06.483 --> 00:18:09.695
[rumbling]

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.741
<i>So what will... do when you
hear a volcano erupting?</i>

00:18:13.866 --> 00:18:16.744
<i>That's right, duck and cover.</i>

00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:18.829
<i>Looks like you got the idea.</i>

00:18:18.954 --> 00:18:20.831
Duck and cover.

00:18:20.956 --> 00:18:23.500
Thank you and good-bye.

00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:25.502
Okay, any questions?

00:18:25.627 --> 00:18:27.963
That has got to be
the most ridiculous

00:18:28.088 --> 00:18:30.966
load of pig crap
I have ever seen.

00:18:31.091 --> 00:18:32.926
That's enough out of you!

00:18:34.178 --> 00:18:35.637
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt,

00:18:35.763 --> 00:18:37.639
then we'll see
who's a little bastard.

00:18:37.765 --> 00:18:40.809
Hey, seriously, you guys!

00:18:40.934 --> 00:18:42.561
Kill it, Stan.
Kill it.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.611
Come on, Stan, kill it!

00:18:50.736 --> 00:18:52.571
Oh, damn it, I can't do it!

00:18:52.696 --> 00:18:54.740
You pansy!
Give me that gun.

00:18:54.865 --> 00:18:56.950
Hey!
Cartman?

00:18:57.075 --> 00:18:58.577
God damn it, don't shoot me!

00:18:58.702 --> 00:19:00.162
What the Sam Hill?

00:19:00.287 --> 00:19:01.955
I was just trying
to scare you guys.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.624
You can put the gun down now.

00:19:03.749 --> 00:19:06.752
So much for the cover
of "Guns & Ammo."

00:19:06.877 --> 00:19:08.796
Yepper,
but I think we've learned

00:19:08.921 --> 00:19:10.964
some important lessons, Ned. I think...

00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:12.966
Whoa!

00:19:13.091 --> 00:19:14.676
Holy crap.

00:19:14.802 --> 00:19:17.054
The mountain,
it's blown its top!

00:19:17.179 --> 00:19:19.264
[rumbling]

00:19:21.683 --> 00:19:24.478
Oh, my God, they killed Kenny!

00:19:24.603 --> 00:19:26.605
No, I'm okay.
[screaming]

00:19:29.441 --> 00:19:30.776
Look, the volcano.

00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:32.903
Quick, duck and cover!

00:19:33.987 --> 00:19:35.614
[all screaming]

00:19:35.739 --> 00:19:38.992
That lava is coming
right for us.

00:19:39.117 --> 00:19:41.245
Oh, no, look.

00:19:42.579 --> 00:19:44.790
What the hell is this
trench doing here?

00:19:44.915 --> 00:19:46.542
We can't get across!

00:19:46.667 --> 00:19:48.544
It now looks
as if the missing children

00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:50.879
are trapped in the path
of hot, nasty lava.

00:19:51.004 --> 00:19:54.842
God, please deliver
those darling kids from...

00:19:54.967 --> 00:19:57.845
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Three, two and one.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.097
God, please deliver...

00:20:00.222 --> 00:20:01.807
Help!

00:20:05.477 --> 00:20:07.479
[grumbles]

00:20:07.604 --> 00:20:10.607
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:20:10.732 --> 00:20:13.151
Jiminy, it's the real
Scuzzlebutt!

00:20:13.277 --> 00:20:15.279
What?
Scuzzlebutt's real?

00:20:15.404 --> 00:20:17.322
Oh, my God!
Look at his leg!

00:20:17.447 --> 00:20:20.200
Hi, kids,
I'm TV's Patrick Duffy.

00:20:20.325 --> 00:20:22.327
Quick, Ned, shoot it!

00:20:22.452 --> 00:20:26.039
[gun clicks]
Oh, no, out of ammo.

00:20:26.164 --> 00:20:27.374
[grumbles]

00:20:27.499 --> 00:20:29.918
What is that thing?

00:20:30.043 --> 00:20:31.920
That's Scuzzlebutt.

00:20:32.045 --> 00:20:35.215
Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy
for a leg and weaves baskets.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.010
This isn't happening.
Everyone look away, please.

00:20:38.135 --> 00:20:40.053
Nothing to see here.

00:20:40.178 --> 00:20:43.557
Well, boys, I'm sorry
I got you all killed.

00:20:43.682 --> 00:20:49.062
##

00:20:49.187 --> 00:20:50.898
Ahhh!

00:20:51.023 --> 00:20:53.275
##

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.652
Whoa, he built a wicker basket.

00:20:55.777 --> 00:20:58.071
Hey, he's saving us.

00:21:00.032 --> 00:21:02.492
[grumbles]

00:21:02.618 --> 00:21:05.037
Scuzzlebutt saved the day.

00:21:05.162 --> 00:21:06.914
And my calculations worked.

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:10.292
The lava's following
the trench into the canyon.

00:21:10.417 --> 00:21:13.420
Hmm, where exactly
does the canyon go?

00:21:13.545 --> 00:21:15.213
Uh...

00:21:16.757 --> 00:21:19.551
[all screaming]

00:21:19.676 --> 00:21:22.638
South Park is saved.

00:21:22.763 --> 00:21:26.433
Hey, look, Kenny's okay.
[muffled speech]

00:21:26.558 --> 00:21:29.645
And now these humble people
can rejoice and celebrate

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.356
their jovial victory
over nature.

00:21:32.481 --> 00:21:34.983
I'm getting word that the chef
of the school cafeteria

00:21:35.108 --> 00:21:38.695
wants to sing a song about this
thrilling struggle of humanity.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.574
# Ooh baby every time
that we kiss #

00:21:42.699 --> 00:21:44.201
# Hot lava #

00:21:44.326 --> 00:21:46.453
# Every time that
we make love, hot lava #

00:21:46.578 --> 00:21:48.038
# Hot lava #

00:21:48.163 --> 00:21:49.831
# Lava so hot
it makes me sweat #

00:21:49.957 --> 00:21:51.500
# Lava so warm and red and wet #

00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:53.043
# Lava #

00:21:53.168 --> 00:21:54.461
Mayor, what do you have to say

00:21:54.586 --> 00:21:55.837
about this wonderful outcome?

00:21:55.963 --> 00:21:57.965
Well, we owe everything

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:02.177
to this friendly,
yet misunderstood creature.

00:22:02.302 --> 00:22:04.972
Thank you, Scuzzlebutt.

00:22:05.097 --> 00:22:06.515
Friend.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.351
Oh, how sweet.

00:22:12.062 --> 00:22:14.314
I did it, I did it!
I finally killed something.

00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:15.816
Oh, my God, what has he done?

00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:17.317
Turn off the cameras.

00:22:17.442 --> 00:22:18.986
Hey, that was easy.

00:22:19.111 --> 00:22:20.904
No!

00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:23.031
Why, God?
Why?

00:22:23.156 --> 00:22:25.325
Damn it, Stan.
You shouldn't have done that.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:26.702
What, why?

00:22:26.827 --> 00:22:28.620
Yeah, make up your mind, dude.

00:22:28.745 --> 00:22:30.998
Stan, some things you kill
and some things you don't. See?

00:22:31.123 --> 00:22:32.457
No.

00:22:32.582 --> 00:22:34.418
Only now, in this late hour,

00:22:34.543 --> 00:22:36.545
do I see the folly of guns.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.923
I'll never use a gun again.

00:22:40.048 --> 00:22:42.175
[gunshot]
[muffled screaming]

00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:46.847
But I just wanted you
to be proud of me,

00:22:46.972 --> 00:22:48.098
like you were with Kenny.

00:22:48.223 --> 00:22:49.891
But Kenny's dead now, Stan.

00:22:50.017 --> 00:22:51.977
And you're always gonna
be my nephew.

00:22:52.102 --> 00:22:54.229
And you just
can't kill anything.

00:22:54.354 --> 00:22:55.939
You understand?

00:22:56.064 --> 00:22:57.983
Dude, I don't
understand hunting at all.

00:22:58.108 --> 00:23:00.110
Yeah, it's stupid.
Let's go watch cartoons.

00:23:00.235 --> 00:23:02.237
Yeah, cartoons kick ass.
