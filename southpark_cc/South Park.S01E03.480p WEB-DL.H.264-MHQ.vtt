# I'm going down to South Park #

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:14.828
# Gonna have myself a time #

00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:16.496
Both: # Friendly
faces everywhere #

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:18.123
# Humble folks
without temptations #

00:00:18.248 --> 00:00:19.541
# I'm going down to South Park #

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.793
# Gonna leave my woes behind #

00:00:21.918 --> 00:00:23.420
# Ample parking day or night #

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:25.130
# People spouting
"Howdy neighbor" #

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:26.548
# Heading on up to South Park #

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:28.300
# Gonna see if I can't unwind #

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:31.678
# [muffled singing] #

00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:33.180
# So come on
down to South park #

00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:35.140
# And meet some friends
of mine #

00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.309
Now you be careful, Eric.

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:39.770
The woods can be very dangerous.

00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:42.898
Okay, Mom.

00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:44.858
Ready to go hunting, Cartman?

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:47.319
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says
we gotta get up there early.

00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:48.361
Right, Uncle Jimbo?

00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:50.155
That's right, Stanley.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.282
Animals are much easier
to shoot in the morning.

00:00:52.407 --> 00:00:53.784
Here, hon.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.328
I packed you Cheesy Poofs
and Happy Tarts.

00:00:56.453 --> 00:00:58.872
Don't worry, Miss Cartman,
we'll take care of him.

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:02.000
I brought my old war buddy,
Ned, to keep things safe.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:05.670
Hello, Mrs. Cartman.
How are you today?

00:01:05.796 --> 00:01:07.923
Be sure to use
lots of bug spray,

00:01:08.048 --> 00:01:09.508
and if you have
to poo-poo,

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.676
don't wipe with poison ivy.

00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:14.304
[laughter]
Dude, that's sick, Mom!

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.474
And I know it can get scary
up in those woods,

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:21.311
but just remember,
Mommy's not far away.

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:23.730
[laughter]
Drive! Drive!

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:25.857
You give your mommy a kissy.

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:27.776
Drive the car, damn it!
Drive!

00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:32.155
"Don't get scared up
in the mountains, Cartman."

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.407
Shut up!
I'm not scared of nothing.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.035
Maybe your mom can give me
a kiss too, Cartman.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.578
[muffled speech]

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:41.665
Oh, oh!
That's disgusting.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.834
You piece of crap!
I'll kill you!

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.502
That's the spirit, boys.

00:01:45.627 --> 00:01:47.671
Let's get that
testosterone flowing.

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:49.506
Yeeh!

00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:51.842
Now, boys, boys, I need
to get serious for a minute.

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:54.928
I want you to understand
a few basic rules of hunting,

00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:56.638
since this is your first time.

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:58.807
First of all, don't
ever walk with your gun

00:01:58.932 --> 00:02:00.517
unless the safety's on.

00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:02.853
Second, don't shoot anything
that looks human.

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:05.689
And third, never spill your
beer in the bullet chamber.

00:02:05.814 --> 00:02:08.024
Uh, Uncle Jimbo,
we don't drink beer.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.109
You what?!

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:10.735
Yeah, that's right,

00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:12.988
I don't think eight-year-old
kids drink beer.

00:02:13.113 --> 00:02:14.990
I like chocolate milk!

00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:17.492
Well, we'll be doing plenty
of drinking on this trip.

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:20.662
After all,
hunter sober is like...

00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:22.956
Fishing... sober.

00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:25.125
It sure will be nice
to get out of the city

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.294
for a while,
away from civilization.

00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:34.134
Well, here we are.

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.512
Okay, each of you young'uns
take a gun, a beer,

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:39.472
and some smokes.

00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:42.517
Hey, I didn't get a gun.

00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:45.562
Sweet. This is like
the gun I used in 'Nam.

00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:47.355
You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.608
Were you stationed in Da Nang?

00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:51.026
Cartman always
makes stuff up, Ned.

00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:52.611
You can't believe
anything he says.

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:54.571
Hey, I'll blow
your freaking head off.

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:57.073
Hey, look out, son.
That's dangerous.

00:02:57.198 --> 00:02:58.950
You're gonna spill your beer.

00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:05.415
My Uncle Jimbo
says that after this

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.292
he's gonna take me
hunting in Africa.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.210
Wow, that'll be cool.

00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:12.881
My mom says there's a lot
of black people in Africa.

00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:14.549
Boys, lookie there.

00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:16.968
That there is
a Rocky Mountain black bear.

00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:18.511
One of the few remaining
of its kind.

00:03:18.637 --> 00:03:20.680
Isn't it beautiful?

00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:22.599
My God,
it's coming right for us!

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.812
Hey, it wasn't
coming right for us.

00:03:27.938 --> 00:03:30.273
It was just sitting there.
Shh, not so loud.

00:03:30.398 --> 00:03:32.317
Now that there
is just a technicality.

00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:33.985
What do you mean?
You see, boys,

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.987
the Democrats have passed
a lot of laws

00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:37.572
trying to stop us from hunting.

00:03:37.697 --> 00:03:39.324
Democrats piss me off!

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.409
They say we can't shoot
certain animals anymore

00:03:41.534 --> 00:03:43.703
unless they're posing
an immediate threat.

00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:45.789
Therefore,
before we shoot something,

00:03:45.914 --> 00:03:48.333
we have to say,
"It's coming right for us."

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:50.001
Wow, you're smart, Uncle Jimbo.

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:52.170
Jimbo, look.

00:03:52.295 --> 00:03:54.381
Oh, it's a deer.

00:03:54.506 --> 00:03:57.842
Looks like about
a 45-gauge, Ned.

00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:00.762
It's coming right for us!

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:05.684
Kickass!

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:07.477
Did you see that?

00:04:07.602 --> 00:04:09.813
I was imperiled by
that ferocious, charging buck.

00:04:09.938 --> 00:04:12.565
Rabbit, rabbit, five o'clock.

00:04:13.984 --> 00:04:16.528
Let's move!
Move!

00:04:16.653 --> 00:04:18.697
Is this hunting?
I guess so.

00:04:18.822 --> 00:04:21.408
Uh, dude, I'm starting
to have flashbacks.

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:23.827
What?
Stand forth, pull up flank.

00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:26.579
Look out for Charlies
up in the trees.

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:32.585
This one's yours, Stan.

00:04:35.296 --> 00:04:38.425
It's coming right for us.
It's coming right for us.

00:04:42.178 --> 00:04:44.681
Shoot it, Stan.
I got your back, soldier.

00:04:46.433 --> 00:04:48.810
I can't.

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:50.645
What the...
What's wrong with you?

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.230
I don't wanna shoot the bunny.

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:53.690
What the hell
are you talking about,

00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:55.316
you don't wanna shoot the bunny?

00:04:55.442 --> 00:04:56.943
You're babbling,
you're not making any sense.

00:04:57.068 --> 00:04:58.445
You're hysterical.
I'm not hysterical.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.196
I just don't wanna
shoot the bunny.

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:01.948
No nephew of mine
is gonna be a tree-hugger.

00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:03.742
Yeah, hippie,
go back to Woodstock

00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:05.618
if you can't shoot anything.

00:05:05.744 --> 00:05:07.912
I can shoot you, fatass!
I can shoot you, too!

00:05:08.038 --> 00:05:10.165
I'll kill you!
I'll fill you full of lead!

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.083
[rumbling]

00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:14.210

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.314
Yeah, Frank.
It's Randy.

Uh-huh. Good.

00:05:36.816 --> 00:05:39.778
Yeah, listen,
the little needle is moving.

00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:41.571
Yeah, it's going
back and forth really fast.

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:44.491
What does that mean?
Uh-huh?

00:05:44.616 --> 00:05:48.286
Uh-huh.
Let me check.

00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:51.206
Yeah, it's smoking.
Uh-huh.

00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:55.418
Oh, really?
Really?

00:05:55.543 --> 00:05:58.505

This wood won't burn.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.855
Well, Ned, looks like
we'll have to use

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.482
the old Indian fire trick.

00:06:17.607 --> 00:06:19.484
Yep.

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.960
God damn it, Ned.
I just got that van.

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:39.045
How the hell are we
supposed to get home?

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.464
Oh, it hurts, it hurts!

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:43.591
Hey, you guys.

00:06:43.716 --> 00:06:45.552
This works pretty good
right now.

00:06:45.677 --> 00:06:48.346
But you see, Mr. Mayor,

00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:50.723
you can't stop serving
Salisbury steak

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:52.308
in our public schools.

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:54.269
What's next, meatloaf?

00:06:54.394 --> 00:06:57.355
We are quite aware
of your concerns, Chef, but...

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.691
<i>Mayor, the geologist
is here to see you.</i>

00:06:59.816 --> 00:07:01.818
My geologist? Now?

00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:03.194
Tell him the infection is fine

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.863
and I don't need
another checkup.

00:07:04.988 --> 00:07:06.823
<i>No, Mayor, that's
a gynecologist.</i>

00:07:06.948 --> 00:07:08.741
<i>A geologist studies the earth.</i>

00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:10.827
Don't you think I know that?

00:07:10.952 --> 00:07:12.704
How dare you insult
my intellect.

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:14.664
I went to Princeton
for God's sake.

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:16.291
You get out of my office.

00:07:16.416 --> 00:07:18.042
<i>I'm not in your office, Mayor.</i>

00:07:18.168 --> 00:07:21.379
<i>I'm talking to you
through a speaker.</i>

00:07:21.504 --> 00:07:23.965
Just send in the geometrist.
<i>Geologist.</i>

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.967
You are fired, buddy!

<i>Thank you, Mayor. It's
been great working for you.</i>

00:07:28.303 --> 00:07:30.513
Mayor, we've got
a very big problem.

00:07:30.638 --> 00:07:32.432

Well, this graph shows
everything from normal to bad.

Mayor, some of
the school children

00:07:59.584 --> 00:08:02.503
are up camping
on that mountain right now.

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:03.880
Oh, this is big.

00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:06.049
Johnson, Johnson, are you there?

00:08:06.174 --> 00:08:07.800
<i>Uh, you just fired
Johnson, Mayor.</i>

00:08:07.926 --> 00:08:09.427
<i>I'm his replacement, Ted.</i>

00:08:09.552 --> 00:08:11.596
Ted, we have got
a major crisis here.

00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:13.473
I want you to get
on the phone and call

00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:15.767
"Inside Edition," "Rescue 911,"

00:08:15.892 --> 00:08:17.602
oh, and
"Entertainment Tonight."

00:08:17.727 --> 00:08:19.771
You better get
my stylist on the phone, too.

00:08:19.896 --> 00:08:23.024
Don't worry.
Things are under control.

00:08:24.692 --> 00:08:28.321
And then Ned picked
up the grenade and... boom!

00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:30.240
Blasted his arm clear off.

00:08:30.365 --> 00:08:32.992
We spent three hours
looking for that damn arm,

00:08:33.117 --> 00:08:34.827
but it was never to be found.

00:08:34.953 --> 00:08:37.830
Some say it's still
crawling around to this day.

00:08:37.956 --> 00:08:39.457
[growls]

00:08:39.582 --> 00:08:41.584
[laughter]
Ha, gotcha!

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:43.544
Heh, that's not scary.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.672
You were scared, Cartman.
You almost peed your pants.

00:08:45.797 --> 00:08:47.799
Shut up!
I didn't pee my pants.

00:08:47.924 --> 00:08:49.342
Hey, Ned, hand me that gin.

00:08:52.262 --> 00:08:54.180
You boys want to tie one on?

00:08:54.305 --> 00:08:56.266
No, no thanks.
That stuff tastes like pee.

00:08:56.391 --> 00:08:59.143
Yeah, Cartman's pee.
Hey, you would taste my pee.

00:08:59.269 --> 00:09:00.520
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:03.147
Can't you have a little alcohol?

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:08.361
Christ, look at that
little bastard go!

00:09:08.486 --> 00:09:09.988
Now you see that, Stan?

00:09:10.113 --> 00:09:12.282
Now that is
a dirty little bastard.

00:09:12.407 --> 00:09:14.617
Hey, I'm a dirty
little bastard, too.

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:17.161
Hey, you guys,
I know a scary story.

00:09:17.287 --> 00:09:19.622
Shut up, Cartman.
You can't scare anybody.

00:09:19.747 --> 00:09:21.207
Oh, yeah?

00:09:21.332 --> 00:09:24.085
You guys ever heard
of Scuzzlebutt?

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.336
What-lebutt?

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:27.005
Scuzzlebutt is a creature

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.632
that lives up
on this very mountain

00:09:29.757 --> 00:09:33.011
and kills anybody
who dares climb to the top.

00:09:33.136 --> 00:09:34.637
Why?

00:09:34.762 --> 00:09:36.639
Because it loves
the taste of blood

00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:40.226
and likes to add pieces
to its deformed body.

00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:41.686
Deformed how?

00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:43.646
Well, on his left arm

00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:45.940
instead of a hand, he has...

00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:47.358
A hook.
A knife.

00:09:47.483 --> 00:09:50.611
No, a piece of celery.
Celery?

00:09:50.737 --> 00:09:52.655
Yes, and he walks with a limp,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.074
because one of
his legs is missing.

00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:56.909
And where his leg should be,

00:09:57.035 --> 00:09:59.912
there's nothing but...
Patrick Duffy.

00:10:00.038 --> 00:10:02.123
Patrick Duffy?

00:10:02.248 --> 00:10:04.083
Damn it, Cartman,
that's not scary.

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:06.461
What do you mean? Have you
ever seen "Step by Step?"

00:10:07.712 --> 00:10:09.505
So he lives alone
on this mountain

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.258
and weaves baskets
and other assorted crafts.

00:10:12.383 --> 00:10:14.135
They say that on quiet nights

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.554
you can hear him weaving
his baskets.

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:19.724
Ka-shink, ka-shink, ka-shink.

00:10:19.849 --> 00:10:22.101
Cartman, you suck
at telling scary stories.

00:10:22.226 --> 00:10:23.561
Yeah, give me that flashlight.

00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:24.562
[muffled speech]

00:10:24.687 --> 00:10:27.065
[rumbling]

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.691
What's that?
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt

00:10:28.816 --> 00:10:30.485
coming to weave us
into wicker baskets.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.320
Hey, it might be.

00:10:32.445 --> 00:10:35.073
Gosh, I hope he doesn't
cut me with his celery hand.

00:10:35.198 --> 00:10:36.366
[laughter]
Screw you guys!

00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:38.576
Fatass!
Go to hell!

00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:41.579
Hey, Ned, why don't you whip
out the old cancer kazoo.

00:10:41.704 --> 00:10:44.874
Let's do a little song.

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:47.418
# Kumbaya, my Lord #

00:10:47.543 --> 00:10:50.213
# Kumbaya #

00:10:50.338 --> 00:10:52.673
# Kumbaya, my Lord #

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:55.009
# Kumbaya #

00:10:55.134 --> 00:10:57.387
# Kumbaya, my Lord #

00:10:57.512 --> 00:11:00.348
# Kumbaya #

00:11:00.473 --> 00:11:05.144
# Oh Lord, Kumbaya #

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:08.940
# Someone's crying, Lord,
Kumbaya #

00:11:09.065 --> 00:11:11.150
They don't think
Scuzzlebutt is scary, huh?

00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:12.652
Let's see how they like it

00:11:12.777 --> 00:11:14.987
when they actually
see Scuzzlebutt.

00:11:15.113 --> 00:11:16.864
I'll scare the hell
out of them tomorrow.

00:11:16.989 --> 00:11:20.660
# Someone's crying, Lord,
Kumbaya #

00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:24.247
# Oh Lord, Kumbaya #

00:11:26.082 --> 00:11:27.792
[rooster crows]

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:29.836
Stan, Stan, wake up.

00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:31.337
What, dude?

00:11:31.462 --> 00:11:32.880
I don't know where Cartman is.

00:11:33.005 --> 00:11:34.173
I think something took him away.

00:11:34.298 --> 00:11:35.716
Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?

00:11:35.842 --> 00:11:37.635
They're out fishing with Kenny.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.596
With Kenny? But this is
supposed to be my camping trip.

00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:42.432
Why do they like Kenny so much?

00:11:42.557 --> 00:11:44.475
Doesn't he like me anymore?

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.561
Well, Stan, you want
to know what I think?

00:11:46.686 --> 00:11:48.688
What?
[farts]

00:11:50.565 --> 00:11:52.608
What a beautiful morning
for fishing.

00:11:52.733 --> 00:11:54.819
There's one.
There's a fish right there.

00:11:57.947 --> 00:11:59.532
Got it.

00:12:01.868 --> 00:12:03.244
Great instincts, boy.

00:12:03.369 --> 00:12:05.079
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing.

00:12:05.204 --> 00:12:07.331
Who?
The fat kid?

00:12:07.457 --> 00:12:09.459
Yeah.
Ah, hell.

00:12:09.584 --> 00:12:11.419
I guess we better
go look for him.

00:12:11.544 --> 00:12:12.837
Ned, you gotta cut it short.

00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:14.964
Fire out the 12-20.

00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:21.387
Well, I think
that's about the limit

00:12:21.512 --> 00:12:22.930
for our fishing permit.

00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:25.850
Oh, man, it smells
like dead fish.

00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:27.477
[muffled speech]

00:12:27.602 --> 00:12:30.396
Oh, man, that is nasty.

00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:32.732
Yeah, I don't think
I've ever seen a kid

00:12:32.857 --> 00:12:34.275
as cool as you, Kenny.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.819
I'm making you
my honorary nephew.

00:12:36.944 --> 00:12:37.820
[muffled speech]

00:12:37.945 --> 00:12:39.947
<i>[somber music]</i>

00:12:42.325 --> 00:12:45.453
The people of South Park
are humble and friendly,

00:12:45.578 --> 00:12:47.622
but now a ticking
time bomb of hot lava

00:12:47.747 --> 00:12:50.082
waits to engulf these people
and end their miserable lives

00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:51.709
with one last fleeting moment

00:12:51.834 --> 00:12:54.337
of excruciatingly painful,
burning agony.

00:12:54.462 --> 00:12:57.548
Hey, I'm on TV!
I'm on TV!

00:12:57.673 --> 00:12:59.258
Mayor, what are you doing

00:12:59.383 --> 00:13:01.135
to prepare for this
inevitable catastrophe?

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.097
All we know right now
is that some of our children

00:13:05.223 --> 00:13:08.559
are camping on that mountain
and... uh, I'm sorry.

00:13:08.684 --> 00:13:10.436
Can I start over?
Huh?

00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:14.232
You can edit this, right?
Ready? Three, two, one.

00:13:14.357 --> 00:13:15.983
All we know right now

00:13:16.108 --> 00:13:17.735
is that some of our children

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.820
are up camping on that mountain.

00:13:19.946 --> 00:13:22.657
We can't do anything
until we get them.

00:13:22.782 --> 00:13:27.703
Okay, people,
let's go get those kids!

00:13:27.828 --> 00:13:30.706
Come on, everybody.
You gotta help the children.

00:13:32.542 --> 00:13:34.961
Well, he couldn't have gone far.

00:13:35.086 --> 00:13:36.712
Unless something drug him off.

00:13:36.837 --> 00:13:40.466
There's not many animals
out today, Jimbo.

00:13:40.591 --> 00:13:43.511
Yeah, it's almost like
something funny's going on.

00:13:43.636 --> 00:13:46.138
[rumbling]

00:13:46.264 --> 00:13:48.140
Christ, Ned, what'd
you have for breakfast?

00:13:48.266 --> 00:13:51.310
I don't know, man.
I've got some bad gas.

00:13:51.435 --> 00:13:53.688
Wait, there's a ram.

00:13:53.813 --> 00:13:55.523
It's coming right for us!

00:13:58.943 --> 00:14:00.444
Nice shooting, Kenny!

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.738
Here, you need a bigger gun.

00:14:02.863 --> 00:14:05.783
Look!
I am Scuzzlebutt,

00:14:05.908 --> 00:14:07.577
Lord of the mountains.

00:14:07.702 --> 00:14:09.954
Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.747
What is it?

00:14:11.872 --> 00:14:13.833
Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt!
Cartman wasn't lying.

00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.877
Holy crow! We could make
a mint killing this thing.

00:14:17.003 --> 00:14:19.672
We'll be on the cover
of "Guns & Ammo."

00:14:19.797 --> 00:14:22.341
This calls for some HJ-14.

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:25.261
[chuckles] Those guys
are totally scared.

00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:27.722
Fire in the hole!

00:14:29.432 --> 00:14:30.641
Holy crap!

00:14:33.144 --> 00:14:34.895
Damn it, I think I missed.

00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:37.315
What the hell
is wrong with you people?

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.483
Come on, let's move!
Move!

00:14:39.609 --> 00:14:42.403
Wait, wait, ahhh!

00:14:42.528 --> 00:14:44.071
Is it on?
Okay.

00:14:44.196 --> 00:14:46.991
Okay, people, form groups
and search the mountain.

00:14:47.116 --> 00:14:49.910
Report back here every hour.
You got that?

00:14:50.036 --> 00:14:53.080
Mayor, I might have an idea.
Oh, what?

00:14:53.205 --> 00:14:55.041
Well, if we can dig
a very large trench,

00:14:55.166 --> 00:14:57.710
we can divert the lava
into a canyon,

00:14:57.835 --> 00:15:00.963
and then it would bypass South
Park pretty much completely.

00:15:01.088 --> 00:15:03.049
And that would be good, right?

00:15:03.174 --> 00:15:04.508
I'm pretty sure.

00:15:04.634 --> 00:15:06.594
Well, what are we waiting for?

00:15:06.719 --> 00:15:08.804
Okay, people, change of plans.

00:15:08.929 --> 00:15:10.890
Half of you grabs shovels.

00:15:11.015 --> 00:15:13.643
These look like his tracks.
He must have gone this way.

00:15:13.768 --> 00:15:16.729
Ned, prepare some HK-12
and some Plasticine.

00:15:16.854 --> 00:15:19.315
I'll bet that sucker is headed
for a higher elevation.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.401
The higher up it... bird!

00:15:22.526 --> 00:15:24.904
The higher up it goes,
the better it can breathe.

00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:27.365
Look, up there!

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.201
You guys, it's just me.

00:15:30.326 --> 00:15:32.036
Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?

00:15:32.161 --> 00:15:33.996
Does it have
Patrick Duffy for a leg?

00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:35.831
I can't tell.
Let's kill it.

00:15:35.956 --> 00:15:38.793
Got to get out
of this stupid costume.

00:15:38.918 --> 00:15:40.378
Kenny, you take the front.

00:15:40.503 --> 00:15:42.129
No, I can do it, Uncle Jimbo.

00:15:42.254 --> 00:15:43.756
I want to bag that animal.

00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:46.425
That's the spirit, kiddo.
Let's hunt!

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.511
You guys, you guys,
I was just kidding!

00:15:48.636 --> 00:15:50.221
As some people of South Park

00:15:50.346 --> 00:15:51.931
try desperately
to save their mountain town,

00:15:52.056 --> 00:15:53.891
others look
for the missing townspeople.

00:15:54.016 --> 00:15:56.644
But all must take
every precaution necessary.

00:15:56.769 --> 00:15:58.729
Okay, people, listen up.

00:15:58.854 --> 00:16:01.023
As we near the top
of the mountain,

00:16:01.148 --> 00:16:04.819
the chances of our encountering
some lava becomes great.

00:16:04.944 --> 00:16:07.113
Therefore,
I have special ordered

00:16:07.238 --> 00:16:09.281
this training film to assist us

00:16:09.407 --> 00:16:11.283
in volcano safety.

00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:13.411
Mr. Garrison,
if you would, please.

00:16:13.536 --> 00:16:16.288
<i>[cheerful music]</i>

00:16:16.414 --> 00:16:18.666
Harbingers of sorrow,
natural disasters can be

00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:21.419
the cause of troubling
and undesirable stress,

00:16:21.544 --> 00:16:23.629
and a volcano is no exception.

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:26.048
But what should you do
if a volcano erupts near you

00:16:26.173 --> 00:16:27.675
or your family?

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.635
<i>Here, we see the Stephens Family</i>

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.345

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.556
<i>But suddenly,
daughter hears a noise.</i>

00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:35.725
<i>It's a volcano.
Junior seems worried.</i>

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.393
<i>But have no fear, Junior.</i>

00:16:41.814 --> 00:16:44.358
<i>That's right, Jane,
duck and cover.</i>

00:16:44.483 --> 00:16:47.695
[rumbling]

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.741
<i>So what will... do when you
hear a volcano erupting?</i>

00:16:51.866 --> 00:16:54.744
<i>That's right, duck and cover.</i>

00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:56.829
<i>Looks like you got the idea.</i>

00:16:56.954 --> 00:16:58.831
Duck and cover.

00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:01.500
Thank you and good-bye.

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:03.502
Okay, any questions?

00:17:03.627 --> 00:17:05.963
That has got to be
the most ridiculous

00:17:06.088 --> 00:17:08.966
load of pig crap
I have ever seen.

00:17:09.091 --> 00:17:10.926
That's enough out of you!

00:17:12.178 --> 00:17:13.637
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt,

00:17:13.763 --> 00:17:15.639
then we'll see
who's a little bastard.

00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:18.809
Hey, seriously, you guys!

00:17:18.934 --> 00:17:20.561
Kill it, Stan.
Kill it.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.611
Come on, Stan, kill it!

00:17:28.736 --> 00:17:30.571
Oh, damn it, I can't do it!

00:17:30.696 --> 00:17:32.740
You pansy!
Give me that gun.

00:17:32.865 --> 00:17:34.950
Hey!
Cartman?

00:17:35.075 --> 00:17:36.577
God damn it, don't shoot me!

00:17:36.702 --> 00:17:38.162
What the Sam Hill?

00:17:38.287 --> 00:17:39.955
I was just trying
to scare you guys.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.624
You can put the gun down now.

00:17:41.749 --> 00:17:44.752
So much for the cover
of "Guns & Ammo."

00:17:44.877 --> 00:17:46.796
Yepper,
but I think we've learned

00:17:46.921 --> 00:17:48.964
some important lessons, Ned. I think...

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:50.966
Whoa!

00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:52.676
Holy crap.

00:17:52.802 --> 00:17:55.054
The mountain,
it's blown its top!

00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:57.264
[rumbling]

00:17:59.683 --> 00:18:02.478
Oh, my God, they killed Kenny!

00:18:02.603 --> 00:18:04.605
No, I'm okay.
[screaming]

00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:08.776
Look, the volcano.

00:18:08.901 --> 00:18:10.903
Quick, duck and cover!

00:18:11.987 --> 00:18:13.614
[all screaming]

00:18:13.739 --> 00:18:16.992
That lava is coming
right for us.

00:18:17.117 --> 00:18:19.245
Oh, no, look.

00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:22.790
What the hell is this
trench doing here?

00:18:22.915 --> 00:18:24.542
We can't get across!

00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:26.544
It now looks
as if the missing children

00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:28.879
are trapped in the path
of hot, nasty lava.

00:18:29.004 --> 00:18:32.842
God, please deliver
those darling kids from...

00:18:32.967 --> 00:18:35.845
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Three, two and one.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.097
God, please deliver...

00:18:38.222 --> 00:18:39.807
Help!

00:18:43.477 --> 00:18:45.479
[grumbles]

00:18:45.604 --> 00:18:48.607
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:18:48.732 --> 00:18:51.151
Jiminy, it's the real
Scuzzlebutt!

00:18:51.277 --> 00:18:53.279
What?
Scuzzlebutt's real?

00:18:53.404 --> 00:18:55.322
Oh, my God!
Look at his leg!

00:18:55.447 --> 00:18:58.200
Hi, kids,
I'm TV's Patrick Duffy.

00:18:58.325 --> 00:19:00.327
Quick, Ned, shoot it!

00:19:00.452 --> 00:19:04.039
[gun clicks]
Oh, no, out of ammo.

00:19:04.164 --> 00:19:05.374
[grumbles]

00:19:05.499 --> 00:19:07.918
What is that thing?

00:19:08.043 --> 00:19:09.920
That's Scuzzlebutt.

00:19:10.045 --> 00:19:13.215
Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy
for a leg and weaves baskets.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.010
This isn't happening.
Everyone look away, please.

00:19:16.135 --> 00:19:18.053
Nothing to see here.

00:19:18.178 --> 00:19:21.557
Well, boys, I'm sorry
I got you all killed.

00:19:21.682 --> 00:19:27.062
##

00:19:27.187 --> 00:19:28.898
Ahhh!

00:19:29.023 --> 00:19:31.275
##

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.652
Whoa, he built a wicker basket.

00:19:33.777 --> 00:19:36.071
Hey, he's saving us.

00:19:38.032 --> 00:19:40.492
[grumbles]

00:19:40.618 --> 00:19:43.037
Scuzzlebutt saved the day.

00:19:43.162 --> 00:19:44.914
And my calculations worked.

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:48.292
The lava's following
the trench into the canyon.

00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:51.420
Hmm, where exactly
does the canyon go?

00:19:51.545 --> 00:19:53.213
Uh...

00:19:54.757 --> 00:19:57.551
[all screaming]

00:19:57.676 --> 00:20:00.638
South Park is saved.

00:20:00.763 --> 00:20:04.433
Hey, look, Kenny's okay.
[muffled speech]

00:20:04.558 --> 00:20:07.645
And now these humble people
can rejoice and celebrate

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.356
their jovial victory
over nature.

00:20:10.481 --> 00:20:12.983
I'm getting word that the chef
of the school cafeteria

00:20:13.108 --> 00:20:16.695
wants to sing a song about this
thrilling struggle of humanity.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.574
# Ooh baby every time
that we kiss #

00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:22.201
# Hot lava #

00:20:22.326 --> 00:20:24.453
# Every time that
we make love, hot lava #

00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:26.038
# Hot lava #

00:20:26.163 --> 00:20:27.831
# Lava so hot
it makes me sweat #

00:20:27.957 --> 00:20:29.500
# Lava so warm and red and wet #

00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:31.043
# Lava #

00:20:31.168 --> 00:20:32.461
Mayor, what do you have to say

00:20:32.586 --> 00:20:33.837
about this wonderful outcome?

00:20:33.963 --> 00:20:35.965
Well, we owe everything

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.177
to this friendly,
yet misunderstood creature.

00:20:40.302 --> 00:20:42.972
Thank you, Scuzzlebutt.

00:20:43.097 --> 00:20:44.515
Friend.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.351
Oh, how sweet.

00:20:50.062 --> 00:20:52.314
I did it, I did it!
I finally killed something.

00:20:52.439 --> 00:20:53.816
Oh, my God, what has he done?

00:20:53.941 --> 00:20:55.317
Turn off the cameras.

00:20:55.442 --> 00:20:56.986
Hey, that was easy.

00:20:57.111 --> 00:20:58.904
No!

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:01.031
Why, God?
Why?

00:21:01.156 --> 00:21:03.325
Damn it, Stan.
You shouldn't have done that.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.702
What, why?

00:21:04.827 --> 00:21:06.620
Yeah, make up your mind, dude.

00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:08.998
Stan, some things you kill
and some things you don't. See?

00:21:09.123 --> 00:21:10.457
No.

00:21:10.582 --> 00:21:12.418
Only now, in this late hour,

00:21:12.543 --> 00:21:14.545
do I see the folly of guns.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.923
I'll never use a gun again.

00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:20.175
[gunshot]
[muffled screaming]

00:21:23.262 --> 00:21:24.847
But I just wanted you
to be proud of me,

00:21:24.972 --> 00:21:26.098
like you were with Kenny.

00:21:26.223 --> 00:21:27.891
But Kenny's dead now, Stan.

00:21:28.017 --> 00:21:29.977
And you're always gonna
be my nephew.

00:21:30.102 --> 00:21:32.229
And you just
can't kill anything.

00:21:32.354 --> 00:21:33.939
You understand?

00:21:34.064 --> 00:21:35.983
Dude, I don't
understand hunting at all.

00:21:36.108 --> 00:21:38.110
Yeah, it's stupid.
Let's go watch cartoons.

00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:40.237
Yeah, cartoons kick ass.
