# I'm going down to South Park #

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:05.873
# Gonna have myself a time #

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:07.583
All: # Friendly faces
everywhere #

00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:09.126
# Humble folks
without temptation #

00:02:09.251 --> 00:02:10.586
# Going down to South Park #

00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:12.421
# Gonna leave my woes behind #

00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:14.131
# Ample parking day or night #

"Howdy neighbor." #

# So come on down
to South Park #

00:02:23.682 --> 00:02:25.351
# And meet some
friends of mine #

00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:30.314
Hey, Stan, did you see that
rainbow this morning?

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.899
Yeah, it was huge.

00:02:32.024 --> 00:02:33.776
Ugh, I hate those things.

00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:35.486
Nobody hates rainbows.

00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:37.696
Yeah, what's there to hate
about rainbows?

00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:40.783
Well, you know, you'll just
be sitting there

00:02:40.908 --> 00:02:43.786
minding your own business, and
they'll come marching in

00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:45.913
and crawl up your leg and
start biting

00:02:46.038 --> 00:02:47.248
the inside of your ass.

00:02:47.373 --> 00:02:49.250
And you'll be all like, "Hey,

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:52.628
get out of my ass, you stupid
rainbows."

00:02:54.255 --> 00:02:56.090
Cartman, what the hell are
you talking about?

00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:58.008
I'm talking about rainbows.

00:02:58.133 --> 00:02:59.802
I hate those friggin' things.

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:01.262
Rainbows are those arches of
color

00:03:01.387 --> 00:03:02.638
that show up during a rainstorm.

00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:06.141
Oh, rainbows.

00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:07.309
Oh, yeah, I like those.

00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:08.560
Those are cool.

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:09.812
What were you talking about?

00:03:09.937 --> 00:03:11.897
Heh? Oh, nothing. Forget it.

00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:14.066
No, what marches in, crawls
up your leg...

00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:15.317
Nothing.
And bites the inside

00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:17.319
of your ass?
Nothing.

00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:19.363
Children, children, remember
the Save Our Fragile Planet

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:21.448
essay contest that you
children worked

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:23.242
so hard on last month?

00:03:25.577 --> 00:03:27.913
One of our very own South Park
students has won

00:03:28.038 --> 00:03:29.331
the national prize.

00:03:29.456 --> 00:03:30.499
[all gasp]

00:03:30.624 --> 00:03:32.584
Wow, I knew I would win.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.212
Gosh, Mr. Garrison, this sure
is exciting.

00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:37.047
That's right, Mr. Hat.

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:38.757
The winner of the national
Save Our Fragile Planet

00:03:38.882 --> 00:03:42.177
contest is... Eric Cartman.

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:43.721
What?
What?

00:03:43.846 --> 00:03:45.389
Congratulations, Eric, on
writing

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:47.016
the award-winning paper.

00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:48.434
Kick ass.

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:50.311
That's impossible.

00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:52.271
Cartman doesn't know a rain
forest from a Pop-Tart.

00:03:52.396 --> 00:03:54.606
Yeah, I do.
Pop-Tarts are frosted.

00:03:54.732 --> 00:03:56.692
Out of over a million papers,

00:03:56.817 --> 00:03:59.111
Eric's was chosen as the
grand prize winner.

00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:01.196
Wow, what did you write
about, Cartman?

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:03.490
Oh, you know, this and that.

00:04:03.615 --> 00:04:05.617
He doesn't even know
what he wrote about.

00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:07.536
What was your paper about,
Wendy?

00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:10.914
My paper was on the suffering
of bottle-nosed dolphins.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.583
Well, you see, you shouldn't
have written

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.043
a paper about dolphins.

00:04:14.168 --> 00:04:15.961
Dolphins are stupid.

00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:17.629
Dude, dolphins are, like, the
second-smartest animal

00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:18.714
on the planet.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.382
[scoffs] Oh, right.

00:04:20.507 --> 00:04:22.843
If they're so damn smart,
how come they get caught

00:04:22.968 --> 00:04:25.012
in those fishing nets all the
time?

00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:27.014
What?
Wait, wait, there's more.

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.808
It says here that Eric's trophy

00:04:29.933 --> 00:04:33.354
will be presented to him by...

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.105
Kathie Lee Gifford?

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.232
Kathie Lee is coming to South
Park?

00:04:37.358 --> 00:04:40.277
And the presentation will be
on national television.

00:04:40.402 --> 00:04:41.737
Both: Television?

00:04:41.862 --> 00:04:44.239
<i>Kathie Lee Gifford.</i>

00:04:44.365 --> 00:04:45.824
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.411
Kathie Lee Gifford in South
Park.

00:04:49.536 --> 00:04:51.372
Oh, my God.

00:04:51.497 --> 00:04:54.291
This is our chance to make a
name for ourselves, to show

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:56.835
that we're not some pissant,
white-bread mountain town.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.671
Better yet, it's a chance for
you to get some publicity.

00:04:59.797 --> 00:05:03.050
Yes, if I can show just how
much I've turned South Park

00:05:03.175 --> 00:05:05.386
around, I could become a
senator.

00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:07.304
Maybe even a state senator.

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:09.723
Mayor, we should decorate the
town square.

00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:12.393
Then we should have the chef
of the school cafeteria sing

00:05:12.518 --> 00:05:15.396
a song and play up the ethnic
diversity of our town.

00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:16.605
That's right.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.232
He's a black guy, isn't he?

00:05:18.357 --> 00:05:20.150
Black as the night itself,
Mayor.

00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:23.320
Yes, and we can even have the
children of South Park

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:24.696
put on a little play.

00:05:24.822 --> 00:05:26.698
Kathie Lee loves children.

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:28.492
If they're working in a
sweatshop, that is.

00:05:28.617 --> 00:05:29.743
Oh!
Ouch.

00:05:29.868 --> 00:05:31.745
[laughs]
Thank you.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.622
You guys, guess what.

00:05:33.747 --> 00:05:37.376
After I'm on television,
I'm gonna be totally famous.

00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:39.253
Hitler was famous too.

00:05:39.378 --> 00:05:40.379
Hello there, children.

00:05:40.504 --> 00:05:41.880
Both: Hey, Chef.

00:05:42.005 --> 00:05:43.132
How are my little crackers
today?

00:05:43.257 --> 00:05:44.591
Good.

00:05:44.716 --> 00:05:46.301
Did y'all hear about the news?

00:05:46.427 --> 00:05:47.970
Kathie Lee Gifford is
coming to South Park.

00:05:48.095 --> 00:05:49.388
Yeah, 'cause Cartman cheated
and won

00:05:49.513 --> 00:05:50.973
the environmental essay contest.

00:05:51.098 --> 00:05:52.599
Hey!
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

00:05:52.724 --> 00:05:55.519
But the mayor just called and
asked me

00:05:55.644 --> 00:05:57.312
to sing at the ceremony.

00:05:57.438 --> 00:05:58.772
Wow, are you gonna do it?

00:05:58.897 --> 00:06:00.774
Of course.

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:04.445
Kathie Lee is a beautiful,
sultry queen of sexual fantasy.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.822
And if I sing to her, maybe I
can lure her into

00:06:06.947 --> 00:06:10.409
a night of exotic delectation.

00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:12.161
Yeah, that'd be cool.

00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:14.037
[mumbling indistinctly]

00:06:14.163 --> 00:06:17.583
Well, three times bigger than
Frank Gifford's, anyway.

00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:20.169
Oh, I can't even concentrate
on grading papers

00:06:20.294 --> 00:06:21.879
with all this excitement.

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.674
Why are you looking at me like
that, Mr. Hat?

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:28.135
Have you forgotten about all
the pain and suffering

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.179
that Kathie Lee Gifford caused
you?

00:06:30.304 --> 00:06:33.265
Mr. Hat, that was a long time
ago, and...

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.975
And I was only a child.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.894
We could've won that
talent show.

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:38.687
We could've been huge.

00:06:38.812 --> 00:06:40.147
Knock-knock, Mr. Hat.

00:06:40.272 --> 00:06:42.024
Who's there?
Orange.

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:43.567
Orange who?

00:06:43.692 --> 00:06:45.944
Orange you glad
I didn't say banana?

00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:49.865
Thank you.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.203
Wow, Mr. Hat, looks like we
might win.

00:06:54.328 --> 00:07:00.501
And now, our last talent show
finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein.

00:07:00.626 --> 00:07:03.587
# If they could see me now,
that little gang of mine #

00:07:03.712 --> 00:07:06.006
# I'm eating fancy chow
and drinking fancy wine #

00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:08.550
# I'd like those stumble bums
to see for a fact #

00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:11.595
# The kind of top-drawer
first-rate chums I attract #

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.264
# All I can say is wowee,
look at where I am #

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:17.100
# Tonight I landed pow
right in a pot of jam #

00:07:17.226 --> 00:07:19.770
# What a setup, holy cow,
they'd never believe it #

00:07:19.895 --> 00:07:23.023
# If my friends
could see me now #

00:07:23.148 --> 00:07:24.525
[fireworks booming]

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.485
[cheers and applause]

00:07:30.447 --> 00:07:31.698
It wasn't fair.

00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:33.450
She had choreography.

00:07:33.575 --> 00:07:35.327
How could we compete with that?

00:07:35.452 --> 00:07:37.579
But now she's coming to
South Park,

00:07:37.704 --> 00:07:39.873
and I know a way to
make it all better.

00:07:39.998 --> 00:07:41.291
How?
[gasps]

00:07:41.416 --> 00:07:43.544
No, Mr. Hat.

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:45.462
I couldn't...

00:07:45.587 --> 00:07:49.508
kill Kathie Lee Gifford.

00:07:52.386 --> 00:07:54.137
Children, as you all know,

00:07:54.263 --> 00:07:57.641
Ms. Kathie Lee Gifford will be
in South Park to present

00:07:57.766 --> 00:07:59.726
the award to some kid for an
essay.

00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:01.687
That kid is me.
Whatever.

00:08:01.812 --> 00:08:04.940
Now, I'm going to have you
luscious little youngsters

00:08:05.065 --> 00:08:08.402
do a play about the history of
South Park.

00:08:08.527 --> 00:08:10.779
That'll be wonderful, won't
it, Mr. Hat?

00:08:10.904 --> 00:08:12.781
Kill her. Mr. Hat.

00:08:12.906 --> 00:08:16.034
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you
to direct our little play.

00:08:16.159 --> 00:08:17.744
Oh, that's perfect.

00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:20.247
You see, Mr. Hat, we don't have
to kill her.

00:08:20.372 --> 00:08:21.999
We can just upstage her.

00:08:22.124 --> 00:08:23.458
Mrs. Mayor,

00:08:23.584 --> 00:08:25.002
you might want to
review the essays.

00:08:25.127 --> 00:08:26.878
We think Cartman might
have cheated.

00:08:27.004 --> 00:08:28.797
Who cares?

00:08:28.922 --> 00:08:33.552
Now, kids, what's say we give
it our South Park best?

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.347
And who's
our little prizewinner again?

00:08:37.472 --> 00:08:39.141
Me, Eric Cartman.

00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:40.976
How about we get in shape, huh?

00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:43.854
We want to look our best for
the TV cameras, don't we?

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:45.230
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:45.355 --> 00:08:46.940
# I'm gonna be on television #

00:08:47.065 --> 00:08:49.067
# I'm gonna be on television #

00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:52.696
# I'm gonna be on television #

00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:54.656
# I'm gonna be on television #

00:08:54.781 --> 00:08:56.241
We don't believe for a
minute that you won that

00:08:56.366 --> 00:08:57.951
contest fairly, fat boy.

00:08:58.076 --> 00:09:00.078
Ugh, stop defending your
little girlfriend

00:09:00.203 --> 00:09:02.414
for writing about
some stupid fish.

00:09:02.539 --> 00:09:04.833
Dude, dolphins are
intelligent and friendly.

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.419
Intelligent and friendly on
rye bread with some mayonnaise.

00:09:07.544 --> 00:09:09.254
Dolphins are way smarter
than you.

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:11.965
If they're so smart, why do
they live in igloos?

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.300
Dolphins don't live in igloos.

00:09:13.425 --> 00:09:14.593
That's Eskimos.

00:09:14.718 --> 00:09:16.303
Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?

00:09:16.428 --> 00:09:18.972
It's all a bunch of
tree-hugging hippie crap.

00:09:19.097 --> 00:09:20.223
Tell me what you wrote about.

00:09:20.349 --> 00:09:21.600
I can't.

00:09:21.725 --> 00:09:22.976
I have to go home and get
in shape.

00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.436
Yeah, right.

00:09:24.561 --> 00:09:25.937
You'll go and sit in front
of the TV

00:09:26.063 --> 00:09:27.481

That does it.

You're going in the

00:10:50.021 --> 00:10:52.607
She'll make a fool of you again.

00:10:52.733 --> 00:10:55.152
Well, you can just stay in that

you, Cartman?

Haven't you noticed the

You've got to weigh 90 pounds.

Super fat-ass?

Come on, people.

this place around.

00:11:48.663 --> 00:11:52.042
Well, Mr. Garrison, how is the

00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:53.710
Huh? Oh, fine.

00:11:53.835 --> 00:11:55.170
We were just about to
run it from the top.

00:11:55.295 --> 00:11:56.630
Oh, please do.

00:11:56.755 --> 00:11:58.632
I'm dying to see it.

00:11:58.757 --> 00:12:02.177
Okay, all the little pioneers
on this side of the stage.

00:12:02.302 --> 00:12:04.054
Good, and all the little Indians

00:12:04.179 --> 00:12:05.722
go to the center of the stage.

00:12:05.847 --> 00:12:08.183
Am I an Indian or a pioneer?

00:12:08.308 --> 00:12:09.643
Do you have a feather on your
head?

00:12:09.768 --> 00:12:11.603
Yes.
Then you're an Indian.

00:12:11.728 --> 00:12:12.854
Oh.

00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:14.731
Okay, Bebe, this is your line.

00:12:14.856 --> 00:12:18.276
This is the story of South Park.

00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:21.404
It begins over 100 years ago

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:26.409
when the noble and hearty Ute
Indians lived on the land.

00:12:26.535 --> 00:12:29.955
[drums thumping]

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.624
Oh, don't they look adorable?

00:12:32.749 --> 00:12:36.711
Then from the East came the
great white pioneers.

00:12:36.837 --> 00:12:40.966
[together]
Ahh!

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.552
Oh, my God.

00:12:43.677 --> 00:12:45.387
They did it
a lot better this morning.

00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:46.930
They had more energy.

00:12:47.055 --> 00:12:49.724
The pioneers met with the
Indians

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.020
and negotiated for
their fertile lands.

00:12:54.145 --> 00:12:56.606
Mr. Garrison, we cannot have
our children

00:12:56.731 --> 00:12:59.484
beating each other senseless
in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.

00:12:59.609 --> 00:13:01.069
Well, what do you want?

00:13:01.194 --> 00:13:02.654
This is how it happened
in those days.

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:05.031
Take that, you stupid Indian.
Ohh.

00:13:05.156 --> 00:13:08.410
Mr. Garrison, this is not
appropriate.

00:13:08.535 --> 00:13:11.329
Do you actually think that
Kathie Lee Gifford

00:13:11.454 --> 00:13:12.873
would enjoy this?

00:13:12.998 --> 00:13:14.624
To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford.

He said, "To hell with Kathie
Lee Gifford."

00:13:22.215 --> 00:13:27.846
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing
you from directing our play.

[crickets chirping]

00:13:30.181 --> 00:13:32.225
It happened again, didn't it?

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.353
Now we do things my way.

00:13:35.478 --> 00:13:38.398
I can't kill her, Mr. Hat.

00:13:38.523 --> 00:13:41.067

Yeah, I'm really starting to
fill out nicely.

00:13:52.329 --> 00:13:53.914
You're not filling out nicely.

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:55.206
You're fatter than ever.

00:13:55.332 --> 00:13:56.291
I'm not fat.

00:13:56.416 --> 00:13:58.043
I'm getting in shape.

00:13:58.168 --> 00:13:59.878
Cartman, you're such a
fat-ass that when you walk

00:14:00.003 --> 00:14:01.880
down the street, people go,
"God damn it.

00:14:02.005 --> 00:14:03.506
That's a big fat-ass."

No, they don't, you
jealous weakling.

Yes.

I need a gun.

00:14:28.907 --> 00:14:31.409
Would this be for hunting or
protection or other?

00:14:31.534 --> 00:14:33.078
Other.
Alrighty then.

00:14:33.203 --> 00:14:35.830
May I suggest a Stratford
12-millimeter?

00:14:35.956 --> 00:14:37.582
Go ahead.
Try it on.

00:17:26.209 --> 00:17:30.421
##

00:17:30.547 --> 00:17:32.549
Damn, I guess I'm not the
only person in America

00:17:32.674 --> 00:17:34.717
who's thought of
killing Kathie Lee Gifford.

00:17:34.843 --> 00:17:37.512
We love you, Kathie Lee.

00:17:37.637 --> 00:17:39.389
I love you too.

00:17:39.514 --> 00:17:42.767
Come on, you little bitch.

00:17:42.892 --> 00:17:44.477
You've got to come out of your
precious bubble

00:17:44.602 --> 00:17:46.479
sooner or later, missy.

00:17:46.604 --> 00:17:50.191
It is with great pride and
honor that I'd like to welcome

00:17:50.316 --> 00:17:54.154
Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to
South Park.

00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:56.573
[cheers and applause]

00:17:56.698 --> 00:18:00.285
And now our very own
South Park Elementary chef

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.581
will sing a special song in
honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.292
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

00:18:07.417 --> 00:18:11.296
You know, Kathie Lee, you are
a very special woman.

00:18:11.421 --> 00:18:14.257
I don't mean special in a Mary
Tyler Moore way

00:18:14.382 --> 00:18:19.053
or special in an extra-value
meal at Happy Burger way.

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:20.638
No, no, no, no, no.

00:18:20.763 --> 00:18:22.432
I mean special,

00:18:22.557 --> 00:18:24.934
like the song of the
hummingbird as it gets ready

00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:27.896
to find that female hummingbird

00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:30.690
and make sweet love to it all
night long.

00:18:30.815 --> 00:18:34.360
Just two hummingbirds moaning
and groaning and

00:18:34.485 --> 00:18:36.112
letting their bodies caress

00:18:36.237 --> 00:18:39.073
and touch each other in ecstasy.

00:18:39.199 --> 00:18:41.492
# Oh Kathie Lee #

00:18:41.618 --> 00:18:44.829
# How I'd love to lay you down #

00:18:44.954 --> 00:18:48.041
# And lick every inch
of your body #

00:18:48.166 --> 00:18:49.500
# With my tongue #

00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:51.294
What?

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:53.546
# Kathie Lee
you're my sexual fantasy #

00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:56.674
What?
# How about you and me #

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:58.468
Thank you, Chef,
for that heartwarming song.

00:18:58.593 --> 00:19:01.221
# Get it together
and make sweet love? #

00:19:01.346 --> 00:19:02.347
Thank you, Chef.

00:19:02.472 --> 00:19:03.932
Oh, oh.

00:19:04.057 --> 00:19:07.143
God bless you, Kathie Lee.

00:19:07.268 --> 00:19:08.811
Officer Barbrady,

00:19:08.937 --> 00:19:10.438
Mr. Garrison is about to kill
Kathie Lee.

00:19:10.563 --> 00:19:12.106
We have to find him.

00:19:12.232 --> 00:19:14.234
What?
You mean the teacher?

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:16.236
Wait a minute.

00:19:16.361 --> 00:19:18.571
Is there somewhere in town
where I can get a good, clear

00:19:18.696 --> 00:19:20.782
shot...
Or a view of Kathie Lee?

00:19:20.907 --> 00:19:23.743
Hmm, you know, I think the
book depository

00:19:23.868 --> 00:19:25.662
would be a good bet.

00:19:25.787 --> 00:19:28.289
I think the book depository
would be a good bet.

00:19:28.414 --> 00:19:31.668
Book depository, depository,
book depository, depository.

00:19:31.793 --> 00:19:33.544
Damn, he could be anywhere.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:35.505
I'll send out an APB.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:36.756
Wendy, look.

00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:41.177
And now, here to
present the award

00:19:41.302 --> 00:19:45.306
for the environmental essay to
our own Eric Kaufman...

00:19:45.431 --> 00:19:47.183
Cartman, God damn it.

00:19:47.308 --> 00:19:50.228
Is your favorite celebrity
and mine,

00:19:50.353 --> 00:19:53.731
Kathie Lee Gifford.

00:19:53.856 --> 00:19:56.025
[grunts]

00:19:57.318 --> 00:19:59.529
Thank you.
I love you all.

00:19:59.654 --> 00:20:01.614
Mr. Garrison, stop.

00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:03.157
Leave us.

00:20:03.283 --> 00:20:05.159
We must finish what
we have begun.

00:20:05.285 --> 00:20:07.161
I know that she's hurt you.

00:20:07.287 --> 00:20:08.579
She's hurt a lot of people.

00:20:08.705 --> 00:20:10.206
You can't know.

00:20:10.331 --> 00:20:12.583
You should've won
that talent show.

00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:15.378
It is with a great honor and
pride that I present

00:20:15.503 --> 00:20:17.255
the winner this trophy.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.340
Eric, would you please come
up here?

00:20:19.465 --> 00:20:22.969
Here it is, my big
moment of fame.

00:20:23.094 --> 00:20:25.596
And then she finished it
all by throwing her voice

00:20:25.722 --> 00:20:27.515
with two dummies at once.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.310
I know that, Mr. Garrison,
but this isn't the answer.

00:20:30.435 --> 00:20:33.896
It is too late for
me, young Wendy.

00:20:35.898 --> 00:20:38.359
You see, I've learned
something today.

00:20:38.484 --> 00:20:40.278
You can't win all the time.

00:20:40.403 --> 00:20:42.989
And if you don't win, you
certainly can't hold it against

00:20:43.114 --> 00:20:46.117
the person who did, because
that's the only way

00:20:46.242 --> 00:20:47.994
you ever really lose.

00:20:48.119 --> 00:20:50.413
You're... you're right.

00:20:50.538 --> 00:20:52.540
Good.

00:20:52.665 --> 00:20:55.501
Man, did she really throw her
voice with two dummies at once?

00:20:55.626 --> 00:20:57.128
The bitch must die.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.798
Ahh!
[gunshot]

00:21:00.923 --> 00:21:02.759
[mumbles indistinctly]

00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:09.223
Oh, my God.
They killed Kenny.

00:21:09.349 --> 00:21:11.184
You bastard.

00:21:11.309 --> 00:21:12.769
Gun!
Gun!

00:21:12.894 --> 00:21:14.479
Hey, come back.

00:21:14.604 --> 00:21:16.064
We didn't even get to do
our play.

00:21:16.189 --> 00:21:17.899
All: Aww.

00:21:18.024 --> 00:21:19.650
I guess that's it, guys.
Wrap it up.

00:21:19.776 --> 00:21:21.819
Hey, wait a minute.

00:21:21.944 --> 00:21:23.780
When do I get to be on
television?

00:21:23.905 --> 00:21:25.114
Forget it, kid.

00:21:25.239 --> 00:21:26.824
No Kathie Lee, no
public interest.

00:21:26.949 --> 00:21:30.411
But I won the environmental
essay contest.

00:21:30.536 --> 00:21:33.039
You don't
deserve to win, Cartman,

00:21:33.164 --> 00:21:34.707
and you know it.

00:21:34.832 --> 00:21:37.460
I'm holding Cartman's
award-winning paper.

00:21:37.585 --> 00:21:39.879
It's actually nothing more
than "Walden"

00:21:40.004 --> 00:21:42.090
with Henry David Thoreau's
name crossed out

00:21:42.215 --> 00:21:44.550
and Cartman's
name written in its place.

00:21:44.675 --> 00:21:46.052
Who cares?

00:21:46.177 --> 00:21:47.845
Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.139
What about not holding
anything against

00:21:50.264 --> 00:21:51.432
the person who wins?

00:21:51.557 --> 00:21:53.976
Well, not if it's Cartman.

00:21:54.102 --> 00:21:56.479
Hey, where are you all going?

00:21:56.604 --> 00:21:59.190
They don't even know what
"Walden" is.

00:21:59.315 --> 00:22:03.111
I bet if "Walden" was a sitcom
you'd all know what it was.

00:22:03.236 --> 00:22:04.862
Come on, Wendy.

00:22:04.987 --> 00:22:06.280
Kyle's mom will make us
tuna fish sandwiches.

00:22:06.406 --> 00:22:07.782
Oh, what the hell.

00:22:07.907 --> 00:22:10.660
[sobbing] No, no.

00:22:10.785 --> 00:22:13.621
Now I'll be stuck in
this Podunk town forever

00:22:13.746 --> 00:22:16.916
with all these stupid, hick,
redneck, jobless,

00:22:17.041 --> 00:22:18.918
truck-driving idiots.

00:22:19.043 --> 00:22:21.546
Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.

00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:24.215
Thought you could get
away with it, eh, Mr. Hat?

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.716
Well, I would have gotten
away with it

00:22:25.842 --> 00:22:27.552
if it weren't
for those meddling kids.

00:22:27.677 --> 00:22:29.470
You're lucky you missed
Kathie Lee Gifford

00:22:29.595 --> 00:22:32.014
and that nobody got hurt.

00:22:35.393 --> 00:22:36.602
We hope you can come
back to school real soon,

00:22:36.727 --> 00:22:38.438
Mr. Garrison.

00:22:38.563 --> 00:22:39.939
Well, children, I'd love to,
but the doctors say

00:22:40.064 --> 00:22:41.941
that Mr. Hat needs more
therapy.

00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:44.318
We can still get her.

00:22:44.444 --> 00:22:47.196
I'm just so sorry that I ruined
everyone's chances

00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:48.656
for being on TV.

00:22:48.781 --> 00:22:49.866
Not Cartman.

00:22:49.991 --> 00:22:51.367
He gets to be on TV anyway.

00:22:51.492 --> 00:22:53.119
Really? On what?

00:22:53.244 --> 00:22:57.206
Obesity, adiposity, corpulence.

00:22:57.331 --> 00:23:00.334
Whatever word you use, it
represents one thing:

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.253
being a big fat-ass.

00:23:02.378 --> 00:23:05.006
We have with us today live via
satellite Eric Cartman

00:23:05.131 --> 00:23:06.966
from South Park,

00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:10.386
who is now so obese, he can't
even get out of his house.

00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:12.680
When is this gonna be on the
air?

00:23:12.805 --> 00:23:16.058
Is there anything you'd like
to say to people out there?

00:23:16.726 --> 00:23:18.102
Follow your dreams.

00:23:18.227 --> 00:23:20.021
You can reach your goals.

00:23:20.146 --> 00:23:21.606
I'm living proof.

00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:23.774
Beefcake. Beefcake!

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.277
He needs to run his ass
around the block a few times.

00:23:26.402 --> 00:23:29.572
Mmm, how about a little more
of that good loving, Chef?

00:23:29.697 --> 00:23:31.240
Damn, woman.

00:23:31.365 --> 00:23:33.117
I just gave you sweet
loving five minutes ago.

00:23:33.242 --> 00:23:34.994
You trying to kill me?
