00:02:55.492 --> 00:03:00.022
Damn it! My little brother's trying
to follow me to school again.

00:03:00.202 --> 00:03:03.262
Ike, you can't come to school with me.

00:03:03.472 --> 00:03:07.802
- Go home, you little dildo.
- Dude, don't call my brother a dildo.

00:03:07.972 --> 00:03:09.772
- What's a dildo?
- I don't know.

00:03:09.942 --> 00:03:13.312
- Cartman doesn't know either.
- I know what it is!

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:16.212
- Well, what?
- I'm not telling you.

00:03:16.382 --> 00:03:18.472
What's a dildo, Kenny?

00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:25.512
Yeah, that's what Kyle's
little brother is, all right.

00:03:26.592 --> 00:03:29.222
- That kicks ass.
- Check this one out.

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:32.662
- Ready, Ike? Kick the baby.
- Don't kick the baby.

00:03:32.832 --> 00:03:34.232
Kick the baby.

00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:39.992
Looks like you didn't get much sleep.

00:03:40.172 --> 00:03:43.972
- I had these bogus nightmares.
- Really? What about?

00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:48.412
Well, I dreamt that I was lying
in my bed, in the dark...

00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:52.812
...when all of a sudden,
this bright blue light filled the room.

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:57.282
And slowly my bedroom door opened.
The next thing I remember...

00:03:57.452 --> 00:04:00.352
...I was being dragged
through a hallway.

00:04:00.522 --> 00:04:04.982
Then I was on a table, and these
scary aliens wanted to operate on me.

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.792
And they had big heads and black eyes.

00:04:07.962 --> 00:04:10.062
- Dude, visitors!
- What?

00:04:10.232 --> 00:04:14.332
- Those were visitors.
- It was just a dream. My mom said so.

00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:18.372
- They're are real.
- They abduct people and mutilate cows.

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:22.502
Shut up. You're trying to scare me,
and it's not working.

00:04:23.182 --> 00:04:25.342
- Hello, children.
- Hey, Chef.

00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:29.922
- What's for lunch today?
- Salisbury steak with buttered noodles.

00:04:30.092 --> 00:04:33.922
- Bean casserole or vegetable medley.
- Kick ass.

00:04:34.092 --> 00:04:37.532
Did any of you see
the alien spaceship last night?

00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:39.252
Yeah, fat boy saw it.

00:04:39.432 --> 00:04:43.302
That was just a dream.
And I'm not fat, I'm big-boned!

00:04:43.472 --> 00:04:46.922
Was it the ones with the big heads
and black eyes?

00:04:47.102 --> 00:04:51.272
- They took him on their ship.
- Did they give you an anal probe?

00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:52.432
What's that?

00:04:52.612 --> 00:04:55.632
That's when they put a metal hoop
up your butt.

00:04:55.812 --> 00:05:01.152
- They gave you an anal probe, Cartman?
- No! I mean, why would they do that?

00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:04.582
They did, huh?
Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!

00:05:04.752 --> 00:05:06.752
- Anal probe.
- Shut up, dildo!

00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:10.222
I gotta get to the cafeteria.
Watch that fat boy, now.

00:05:10.392 --> 00:05:12.492
He could be under alien control.

00:05:16.602 --> 00:05:19.432
They were real. Sorry about your ass.

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:24.372
Goddamn it, they didn't do anything
to my ass! It was just a dream.

00:05:26.582 --> 00:05:29.012
- Why you walking so funny?
- Shut up!

00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:31.342
No, Ike, go home.

00:05:31.512 --> 00:05:35.542
This is it. This one's for the game.
Kick the baby.

00:05:38.892 --> 00:05:42.292
- Good morning, Mrs. Crabtree.
- Sit down, we're late!

00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:49.232
- He's still there.
- Don't worry.

00:05:49.402 --> 00:05:52.892
If something happens to him,
my parents will blame me.

00:05:53.072 --> 00:05:55.372
Sit down back there!

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:58.472
- Whatever, you fat bitch.
- What did you say?!

00:05:58.642 --> 00:06:01.012
I said, I have a bad itch.

00:06:01.642 --> 00:06:03.542
Oh, my God!

00:06:04.582 --> 00:06:06.712
- Visitors!
- Oh, no!

00:06:06.882 --> 00:06:09.512
Ike! Stop the bus!

00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:12.282
You have to stop this bus!

00:06:12.462 --> 00:06:15.252
- Do you want an office referral?
- No.

00:06:15.422 --> 00:06:17.192
- Then sit down!
- But l...

00:06:24.672 --> 00:06:28.972
- Are those the same visitors you saw?
- Shut up, it's not working.

00:06:29.142 --> 00:06:31.732
- We have to do something.
- We can't.

00:06:31.912 --> 00:06:35.212
- That fat bitch won't let us.
- What did you say?!

00:06:35.382 --> 00:06:40.822
- I said that rabbits eat lettuce.
- Well, yes, they certainly do.

00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:45.992
What am I gonna do? My brother
has been abducted by aliens.

00:06:46.162 --> 00:06:48.122
You farted.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.052
Somebody's baking brownies.

00:06:56.702 --> 00:06:58.862
That's the third cow this month.

00:06:59.042 --> 00:07:03.632
At this rate, all my cattle will die
before the winter's through.

00:07:03.812 --> 00:07:08.612
This isn't unusual. Cows turn
themselves inside out all the time.

00:07:09.782 --> 00:07:13.012
People been saying
they've seen UFOs around.

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:15.212
UFOs?

00:07:15.382 --> 00:07:18.382
And black Army CIA helicopters
and trucks.

00:07:18.552 --> 00:07:22.652
That is the silliest thing
I've ever heard.

00:07:24.132 --> 00:07:27.102
- What was that?
- That was a pigeon.

00:07:27.262 --> 00:07:29.602
What am I supposed to do?

00:07:29.772 --> 00:07:35.002
Just stand here and watch my cattle
get mutilated one by one?

00:07:38.012 --> 00:07:39.202
My cattle!

00:07:43.712 --> 00:07:46.412
See? There is something
funny going on.

00:07:46.582 --> 00:07:50.612
There's nothing funny going on.
I'll get those cows back.

00:07:53.062 --> 00:07:58.492
And now our friend Mr. Hat is going
to tell us about Christopher Columbus.

00:07:58.662 --> 00:08:00.532
That's right, Mr. Garrison.

00:08:00.702 --> 00:08:05.402
Columbus discovered America
and was the Indians' best friend.

00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:09.402
He helped them win their war
against Frederick Douglass...

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:13.912
...and freed the Hebrews from Napoleon
and discovered France.

00:08:14.082 --> 00:08:19.512
I have to help my stupid brother. If I
go home without him, my dad will yell:

00:08:19.682 --> 00:08:23.382
"Where's your brother?
You weren't looking out for him."

00:08:23.552 --> 00:08:26.492
- Let's go find him.
- "He can't think on his own.

00:08:26.692 --> 00:08:29.722
Brush and floss.
Where has that finger been?"

00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:31.762
- Dude!
- Is there a problem?

00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:34.662
- Yes, I have to go now.
- Really, Kyle?

00:08:34.832 --> 00:08:40.772
- What is it? Another prostate tumor?
- My brother's been abducted by aliens.

00:08:40.942 --> 00:08:44.502
It's true. Ask Cartman.
They gave him an anal probe.

00:08:44.672 --> 00:08:49.172
- That's a little joke.
- Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go.

00:08:49.352 --> 00:08:53.542
- Can I please be excused?
- I don't know. Did you ask Mr. Hat?

00:08:53.722 --> 00:08:56.512
I don't wanna ask Mr. Hat.
I'm asking you!

00:08:56.692 --> 00:09:01.892
- I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
- Mr. Hat, may I please be excused?

00:09:02.062 --> 00:09:05.462
Well, Kyle, no!
You hear me? You go to hell!

00:09:05.632 --> 00:09:09.832
You go to hell and you die!
You'll have to take your seat.

00:09:10.002 --> 00:09:13.632
- Damn it!
- Ha-ha, Mr. Hat yelled at you.

00:09:13.842 --> 00:09:16.132
- My ass!
- Damn, Cartman!

00:09:17.812 --> 00:09:20.782
- My ass!
- Dude, he's farting fire!

00:09:20.942 --> 00:09:24.742
It's the alien anal probe.
It's shooting fire from his rectum!

00:09:24.912 --> 00:09:26.712
No, that was just a dream.

00:09:26.882 --> 00:09:31.182
Do you need to sit in the corner
until your gas is under control?

00:09:31.352 --> 00:09:34.292
No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.

00:09:45.302 --> 00:09:49.292
You cows can't get on this train.
This is a people train.

00:09:49.472 --> 00:09:54.412
You cows have no business on a
people train, all right? You're cows.

00:09:54.582 --> 00:09:59.242
Don't try any of that cow hypnosis
on me, all right?

00:09:59.422 --> 00:10:03.322
- Because it's not gonna work.
- Hold it right there, cows.

00:10:03.822 --> 00:10:05.512
Come back here!

00:10:13.562 --> 00:10:17.232
- I sure am hungry.
- How can you eat when you fart fire?

00:10:17.432 --> 00:10:20.202
Shut up, you're being
totally immature.

00:10:20.372 --> 00:10:23.342
- Look, there's Wendy Testaburger.
- Where?

00:10:39.822 --> 00:10:45.732
- Stan wants to kiss Wendy Testaburger
- Shut up, fat ass, I don't like her.

00:10:45.902 --> 00:10:50.662
I'm not fat. You like her because
you throw up when she talks to you.

00:10:50.832 --> 00:10:52.392
- I do not.
- Hi, guys.

00:10:52.572 --> 00:10:53.732
Hi, Wendy.

00:10:53.902 --> 00:10:57.272
Here, Stan, this is for you.

00:10:57.442 --> 00:10:58.812
Bye, Wendy.

00:10:58.972 --> 00:11:01.472
Dude, what does the note say?

00:11:01.642 --> 00:11:05.812
Holy crap! She wants to meet me
at Stark's Pond after school.

00:11:05.982 --> 00:11:09.782
- Whoa, maybe you can kiss her.
- Or slip her the tongue.

00:11:11.192 --> 00:11:14.492
What? How do you know she has a cat?

00:11:18.362 --> 00:11:22.352
Let's figure out how to ditch school
so we can get Ike back.

00:11:22.532 --> 00:11:24.902
Hello, children. How are you?

00:11:25.102 --> 00:11:26.502
- Bad.
- Why bad?

00:11:26.672 --> 00:11:30.472
Have you ever had something happen
but nobody believed you?

00:11:30.642 --> 00:11:35.842
Children, that's a problem we've all
had to face at some time or another.

00:11:36.012 --> 00:11:40.452
Here, let me sing you a little song.
It might clear things up.

00:12:01.402 --> 00:12:03.132
Chef!

00:12:05.472 --> 00:12:07.342
- Do you feel better?
- No.

00:12:07.512 --> 00:12:12.112
Come on, children, what can be so bad?
It's Salisbury-steak day.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:15.642
- Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
- What?!

00:12:15.892 --> 00:12:18.792
What are you doing
eating Salisbury steak?

00:12:18.952 --> 00:12:21.582
- Find him!
- Mr. Garrison won't let us go.

00:12:21.762 --> 00:12:25.662
- He thinks we're making it up.
- You are making it up.

00:12:32.432 --> 00:12:33.992
- What?
- That was cool!

00:12:34.172 --> 00:12:37.572
It's some kind of symbiotic
metamorphosis device.

00:12:37.742 --> 00:12:41.072
This could mean the visitors
want to talk to us.

00:12:41.242 --> 00:12:44.242
I see. You're joining in on the joke.

00:12:44.412 --> 00:12:47.042
It's no joke, children. This is big.

00:12:47.222 --> 00:12:50.482
If I don't get out of school
and get Ike back...

00:12:50.692 --> 00:12:52.652
...my parents will disown me.

00:12:52.862 --> 00:12:55.952
Hold on now.
You got to help the children.

00:12:56.132 --> 00:12:59.692
You guys are going a long way
to try and scare me.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:01.992
I want my Salisbury steak.

00:13:02.162 --> 00:13:07.502
Fire drill, fire drill! Everybody out!
Okay, children, this is your chance.

00:13:07.672 --> 00:13:10.232
Killer. Thanks, Chef.

00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:15.842
First contact with the alien visitors.
I've gotta get myself ready.

00:13:16.012 --> 00:13:19.412
We got out of school
No more school today

00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:21.242
We got out of school

00:13:21.452 --> 00:13:26.412
- You guys, my ass, seriously!
- Okay, you can stop farting fire now.

00:13:26.592 --> 00:13:30.652
- I can't, you son of a bitch!
- How do we get my brother back?

00:13:30.832 --> 00:13:33.802
Would you stop going on
about your brother?

00:13:33.962 --> 00:13:37.262
It was just a dream!
I didn't have an anal probe!

00:13:37.432 --> 00:13:39.922
I am not under alien control!

00:13:51.752 --> 00:13:54.552
- What was that?
- He is under alien control.

00:13:54.722 --> 00:13:59.622
- His butt's linked up to the visitors.
- Son of a bitch!

00:14:02.932 --> 00:14:05.992
Guys, shut up.
I'm not under alien control.

00:14:06.162 --> 00:14:10.622
If you visitors can hear me,
bring back my brother, goddamn it!

00:14:10.802 --> 00:14:13.292
That hurts, you butt-licker!

00:14:13.672 --> 00:14:17.262
- Kyle, look, it's them.
- Give me back my brother!

00:14:21.882 --> 00:14:25.572
- Oh, my God, they killed Kenny!
- You bastards!

00:14:25.752 --> 00:14:30.982
Come back here! Come back!
Damn it, we were so close!

00:14:31.192 --> 00:14:34.592
Hey, look. I think Kenny's okay.

00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:45.962
Wow, poor Kenny.

00:14:46.142 --> 00:14:48.232
- Now do you believe us?
- No.

00:14:48.402 --> 00:14:51.402
- Cartman, they killed Kenny.
- He's not dead.

00:14:51.572 --> 00:14:54.542
Dude, Kenny is dead. See?

00:14:54.712 --> 00:14:57.702
- Shut up, you guys.
- He's dead, Cartman.

00:14:57.882 --> 00:15:02.942
Damn it, I didn't have an anal probe!
Screw you guys, I'm going home.

00:15:03.122 --> 00:15:07.022
- Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
- Dildo!

00:15:07.192 --> 00:15:10.852
- You're all I have left.
- Sorry, I gotta meet Wendy.

00:15:11.032 --> 00:15:15.622
You can't. Poor Ike must be so scared,
up there all alone. Help me.

00:15:15.802 --> 00:15:20.362
Like Chef says, "I'm getting a piece
of loving while the getting's hot."

00:15:20.542 --> 00:15:21.532
Rats!

00:15:24.272 --> 00:15:26.102
- Hello, Eric.
- Hi, Mom.

00:15:26.282 --> 00:15:29.402
- How are you doing?
- Well, I'm pissed off.

00:15:29.582 --> 00:15:33.042
Here, I made you powdered-doughnut
pancake surprise.

00:15:33.222 --> 00:15:37.022
I don't want it!
All the kids in school call me fat.

00:15:37.192 --> 00:15:40.382
- You're not fat, you're big-boned.
- That's what I said.

00:15:40.562 --> 00:15:43.652
You can have an eensy-weensy bit,
can't you?

00:15:43.832 --> 00:15:47.732
- Just a weensy-eensy woo-woo?
- No. Leave me alone, Mom.

00:15:47.902 --> 00:15:51.462
How about a nice chocolate
chicken potpie then?

00:15:51.672 --> 00:15:54.532
Well, that does sound pretty good.

00:15:54.902 --> 00:15:56.842
- Mom?
- Yes, hon?

00:15:57.012 --> 00:16:00.242
If anybody calls or visits,
I'm not here, okay?

00:16:00.412 --> 00:16:04.872
- Sure. You want some Cheesy Poofs too?
- Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.

00:16:08.052 --> 00:16:11.182
She's not coming.
Let's look for the visitors.

00:16:11.352 --> 00:16:14.912
- But her note said she'd be here.
- Hi, Stan.

00:16:15.522 --> 00:16:20.622
- He throws up when you talk to him.
- But why, Stan?

00:16:21.002 --> 00:16:24.432
Would you get down to business
so we can find Ike?

00:16:24.602 --> 00:16:28.132
- Make sweet love by the fire.
- What happened to Ike?

00:16:28.302 --> 00:16:30.332
As UFO sightings increase...

00:16:30.512 --> 00:16:35.032
...more mysterious crop-circle
patterns are appearing in fields.

00:16:35.212 --> 00:16:39.672
These crop circles, when viewed
from above, form strange patterns.

00:16:39.852 --> 00:16:42.912
Hey, that kind of looks
like Tom Selleck.

00:16:43.092 --> 00:16:47.892
Could it be that aliens are trying
to make contact with us on Earth?

00:16:51.262 --> 00:16:54.162
No, Kitty, this is my potpie.

00:16:54.332 --> 00:16:58.702
No, Kitty, you bad kitty.
No, Kitty, this is my potpie!

00:16:58.872 --> 00:17:01.932
Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!

00:17:02.102 --> 00:17:07.632
Then I know a certain kitty-kitty
who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.

00:17:08.412 --> 00:17:09.742
What?!

00:17:09.912 --> 00:17:13.752
I have to go home without him,
and my parents will kill me.

00:17:13.922 --> 00:17:16.352
- Why don't you get the fat kid?
- Why?

00:17:16.522 --> 00:17:20.152
If the fat kid has something
implanted in his ass...

00:17:20.322 --> 00:17:23.222
...maybe he's a part
of the visitors' plan.

00:17:23.392 --> 00:17:26.662
Use the fat kid as bait
to bring them back.

00:17:26.832 --> 00:17:30.662
You're right. Come on, Stan.
We have to get Cartman.

00:17:30.832 --> 00:17:32.992
Come on, Stan.

00:17:33.472 --> 00:17:37.102
Hey, wait. When do I get
to make sweet love?

00:17:41.612 --> 00:17:44.042
No, Kitty, you can't have any!

00:17:44.912 --> 00:17:49.012
No, Kitty, this is my potpie!
Bad kitty!

00:17:49.992 --> 00:17:51.752
Excuse me, Kitty.

00:17:52.092 --> 00:17:55.222
- Eric, look who's here.
- Good work, Mom!

00:17:55.392 --> 00:17:58.592
- Let's play at the bus stop.
- I can't, Mom says...

00:17:58.762 --> 00:18:02.422
That's okay. You need to spend time
with your friends.

00:18:02.602 --> 00:18:06.032
- But I don't want to spend time...
- Don't be difficult!

00:18:06.202 --> 00:18:11.232
- Now, you go and play in the fun snow.
- Goddamn it!

00:18:12.882 --> 00:18:16.572
- I have to get home.
- Don't be such a fraidy cat.

00:18:16.752 --> 00:18:20.702
This rope will make sure
they can't take you onboard again.

00:18:21.182 --> 00:18:24.082
- This sucks!
- How come they aren't coming?

00:18:24.252 --> 00:18:27.152
I think we have
to signal them somehow.

00:18:27.862 --> 00:18:29.792
Hey, he's like Rudolph.

00:18:29.962 --> 00:18:34.362
All you have to do is fart
and the visitors are sure to come.

00:18:34.532 --> 00:18:38.562
Really? I don't think I have
to fart anymore tonight.

00:18:38.732 --> 00:18:41.132
- Sure, you do.
- Come on, fart!

00:18:41.302 --> 00:18:44.102
- I don't wanna!
- He can't hold it in forever.

00:18:44.272 --> 00:18:47.332
- Fart, damn you!
- Okay, that does it!

00:18:47.512 --> 00:18:51.102
Why is it that everything today
has involved things...

00:18:51.282 --> 00:18:54.552
...either going in or coming out
of my ass?

00:18:54.722 --> 00:18:57.512
I'm sick of it!
It's completely immature!

00:18:57.692 --> 00:18:59.482
It's happening again.

00:19:02.022 --> 00:19:05.082
- Whoa, look at that.
- Now do you believe us?

00:19:05.262 --> 00:19:08.492
You can't scare me.
You're making it all up.

00:19:08.662 --> 00:19:12.762
There's an 80-foot satellite dish
sticking out of your ass!

00:19:12.972 --> 00:19:15.162
Sure, you guys, whatever.

00:19:17.012 --> 00:19:21.072
Oh, boy, the aliens are going
to make first contact.

00:19:21.242 --> 00:19:25.772
Hey! Down here!
We are ready for your wisdom.

00:19:26.382 --> 00:19:30.842
And you only got 20 minutes
before Sanford and Son is on!

00:19:31.022 --> 00:19:35.582
You guys, I am seriously
getting pissed off right now.

00:19:35.762 --> 00:19:38.562
I know there's no such thing
as aliens!

00:19:40.602 --> 00:19:43.062
Oh, goddamn it!

00:19:43.372 --> 00:19:48.232
What the...? I tell you, there's
crazy stuff going on in this town.

00:19:48.402 --> 00:19:51.132
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.

00:19:51.312 --> 00:19:54.972
Come down here, you stinking aliens!

00:19:56.912 --> 00:19:59.682
Ask them for your little brother back.

00:19:59.852 --> 00:20:04.812
Visitors, you took my brother. He's
freckled and looks like a football.

00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:09.192
At first I was happy you took him,
but I've learned something:

00:20:09.362 --> 00:20:11.992
Having a little brother is special.

00:20:12.162 --> 00:20:15.602
Heck, I'm just a kid all alone
in this crazy world.

00:20:15.762 --> 00:20:19.672
If you can find it in your hearts
to give my brother back...

00:20:19.842 --> 00:20:22.362
...it would make my life
brighter again.

00:20:22.672 --> 00:20:24.232
That was beautiful.

00:20:24.412 --> 00:20:26.172
- Did it work?
- No.

00:20:26.342 --> 00:20:30.182
You scrawny-assed shit!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:20:30.352 --> 00:20:34.212
You must be some kind of fuck
to ignore a crying child!

00:20:34.382 --> 00:20:38.442
You know what you fucking like?
You like to fuck!

00:20:41.022 --> 00:20:43.552
Hey, Wendy, what's a fuck?

00:20:46.732 --> 00:20:51.792
Ike, jump down! Now!
For the love of God, Ike, jump!

00:20:51.972 --> 00:20:53.132
Don't hurt me.

00:21:09.922 --> 00:21:12.982
I promise I'll be nice to you
from now on.

00:21:13.162 --> 00:21:14.852
Don't kick the baby.

00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:22.662
What are they talking about?

00:21:37.752 --> 00:21:41.652
Ike, do your impersonation
of David Caruso's career!

00:21:41.822 --> 00:21:43.582
It's my turn.

00:21:55.832 --> 00:21:59.672
You guys, get me down from here!

00:22:00.742 --> 00:22:03.672
Help! Sons of bitches!

00:22:03.872 --> 00:22:05.812
Dildo!

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:11.372
- I'm sure glad that's over with.
- Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike!

00:22:11.552 --> 00:22:13.542
She's fly at the sky.

00:22:13.952 --> 00:22:17.582
Wait! Where are you going,
alien visitors? Come back!

00:22:17.752 --> 00:22:21.282
Where's this amazing thing
you were gonna show us?

00:22:21.462 --> 00:22:24.252
It's in the bedroom, ladies.
Come on in.

00:22:24.432 --> 00:22:26.892
We can make it in time for dinner.

00:22:27.062 --> 00:22:29.092
- Thanks for helping.
- Whatever.

00:22:29.262 --> 00:22:31.762
- Hey, I didn't throw up.
- Cool.

00:22:40.282 --> 00:22:41.642
Sorry.

00:22:41.812 --> 00:22:44.242
- Hey, look, a French fry.
- Cool.

00:22:44.412 --> 00:22:47.282
- What's that?
- It's part of a Cheesy Poof.

00:22:47.452 --> 00:22:50.422
- Hey, what's that?
- That's a hamburger.

00:22:50.592 --> 00:22:53.922
- That's from two days ago!
- What about that?

00:22:54.092 --> 00:22:55.392
I don't know.

00:22:57.092 --> 00:23:00.222
The bus will be here.
Cartman's still gone.

00:23:00.402 --> 00:23:02.492
We're running out of friends.

00:23:02.662 --> 00:23:05.532
I wonder what the visitors
gave the cows?

00:23:08.442 --> 00:23:12.962
Cows, I got you cornered.
Let's see you get away now.

00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:24.982
Hey, Cartman.

00:23:25.152 --> 00:23:28.882
The visitors dropped you off
just in time for school.

00:23:29.062 --> 00:23:33.292
- I had a crazy nightmare last night.
- Really? What about?

00:23:33.462 --> 00:23:35.992
Well, I was standing out in a field.

00:23:36.162 --> 00:23:39.602
I had this satellite dish
sticking out of my butt...

00:23:39.772 --> 00:23:42.262
...and then there were
cows and aliens.

00:23:42.442 --> 00:23:46.002
Then I went on the ship,
and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.

00:23:46.172 --> 00:23:48.542
That wasn't a dream.
That happened.

00:23:48.712 --> 00:23:53.442
- Right. Why don't I have pinkeye then?
- You do have pinkeye!

00:23:53.622 --> 00:23:55.952
Son of a bitch!
