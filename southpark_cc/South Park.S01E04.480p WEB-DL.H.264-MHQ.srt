00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:12,926
# I'm going down to South Park #

2
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:14,928
# Gonna have myself a time #

3
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:16,638
All: # Friendly faces
everywhere #

4
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,181
# Humble folks
without temptation #

5
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:19,641
# Going down to South Park #

6
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:21,476
# Gonna leave my woes behind #

7
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:23,186
# Ample parking day or night #

8
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:24,687
# People spouting:
"Howdy neighbor!" #

9
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:26,189
# Headed on up to South Park #

10
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:27,941
# Gonna see if I can't unwind #

11
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:31,110
[singing indistinctly]

12
00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:32,612
# So come on down
to South Park #

13
00:00:32,737 --> 00:00:34,364
# And meet some
friends of mine #

14
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:36,741
Hey, where's the school bus?

15
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,451
We're gonna be late
for football practice.

16
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:40,203
Hiya, Sparky.
Who's that?

17
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:41,496
That's my new dog Sparky.

18
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:42,956
He followed me to the bus stop.

19
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,499
Wow, cool!
Good boy, Sparky.

20
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:45,959
Who's my best buddy?

21
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:47,585
Who's your boy?
Who's your buddy?

22
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,629
Ugh.
You're making me sick, dude.

23
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:51,589
He's part Doberman
and part wolf.

24
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:53,341
He's the toughest dog
on the mountain.

25
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:55,593
No way. Everybody knows
that Sylvester

26
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:58,429
is the toughest dog
in South Park.

27
00:00:58,554 --> 00:00:59,931
[growling]

28
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:01,391
He's not meaner than Sparky!

29
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:02,976
Oh, yeah?
Let's see.

30
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:04,060
Hey, Sylvester!

31
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:05,561
Sparky'll kick his ass!

32
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,313
I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.

33
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:08,606
You're on, dude.

34
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,442
That's it, Sparky, kick his ass!

35
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:14,570
[dogs panting]

36
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:17,240
Huh. He's doing
<i>something</i> to his ass.

37
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:19,200
He's not kicking his ass,
but he's definitely

38
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:20,785
doing something to his ass.

39
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,495
Sparky, bad dog!

40
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,997
[mumbling]

41
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:25,081
What?
Yeah, dude.

42
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:26,165
I think your dog is gay.

43
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,458
What do you mean?

44
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,419
That dog is a gay homosexual.

45
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:30,670
[dogs panting]

46
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:32,338
He's just confused.

47
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:34,090
I think the other dog's
the one that's confused.

48
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:35,174
[mumbling]

49
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,551
Sick! Shut up, dude.

50
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:38,011
[whining]

51
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:39,762
# Stan's dog's a homo #

52
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:41,889
# Stan's dog's a homo #

53
00:01:43,057 --> 00:01:44,934
<i>Okay, children,
I know that you're all</i>

54
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:47,186
extremely excited
and nervous and anxious

55
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:50,148
about the homecoming game
against Middle Park.

56
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:51,774
Who's Middle Park?
What's homecoming?

57
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,484
But just remember
what I taught you

58
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,403
that football
is like making love

59
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:58,114
to a really beautiful woman.

60
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,825
You can't always score,
but when you do,

61
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,453
it makes all the trying
worthwhile.

62
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,497
Now let's start practice.
[whistle blows]

63
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:07,832
Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?

64
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:09,417
Yes, Pip, what is it?

65
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:10,710
I still don't have a helmet.

66
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:11,919
I know, Pip.

67
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:12,920
The school can't afford helmets

68
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:14,172
for everybody.

69
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:15,757
Yes, but couldn't we rotate

70
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:17,175
who doesn't have a helmet
every week?

71
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,676
Does it always have to be me?

72
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:21,054
Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does.

73
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:22,513
Oh.
Sorry, son.

74
00:02:22,638 --> 00:02:24,265
Now get your ass in there.

75
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,726
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

76
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:28,686
Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut,

77
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:29,854
hut, hut, hut.

78
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,565
Hike the damn ball!

79
00:02:33,524 --> 00:02:34,650
[grunts]
[screaming]

80
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:35,693
Hey, how's practice

81
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:36,819
coming there, Chef?

82
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:38,279
Huh? Oh, fine, fine.

83
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:39,697
I don't have to remind you

84
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:41,407
just how important this game is

85
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,159
to us South Park alumni.

86
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:44,702
Elementary school alumni?

87
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:46,370
That's as far as most of us got.

88
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:48,372
You think we have a shot
at beating the spread

89
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:49,957
against Middle Park this year?

90
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,168
I don't know.
What... what's the spread?

91
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:55,046
Middle park by 70 points.
Hmm.

92
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:57,173
Hey, I got it!
I got it, I got it!

93
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:59,634
I don't think we have a chance.

94
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,303
Nonsense, not with my nephew
a quarterback.

95
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:03,846
Right, Stanley?

96
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,056
Huh?

97
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:07,100
[grunts]

98
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:11,104
Attaboy!
Great pass, Stan!

99
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:12,438
Come on, Ned,
we got to get our asses

100
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:14,023
to the bookie!

101
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:15,608
[whistle blows]

102
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:18,236
Okay, that was
a good practice, children.

103
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:20,113
We'll see you here again
tomorrow.

104
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:21,948
Hey, Stan, isn't that your dog?

105
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:24,450
Yeah, he must have followed
me to football practice.

106
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:25,993
You see, he is smart.

107
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,578
Uh, my dog Rex follows me

108
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,831
to football practice
all the time.

109
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:31,791
Yeah, but my dog
found his own way here.

110
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,209
That makes him smarter
than your...

111
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:35,128
[dogs panting]
Sparky, get down!

112
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:37,088
Oh, my God,
what is he doing to my dog?

113
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:38,422
There he goes again.

114
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:40,007
Get down, Sparky, down!

115
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,676
Stan forgot to mention
that his dog

116
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,094
is a gay homosexual.

117
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:44,637
Make him stop!

118
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:46,722
[yelping]

119
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:49,517
[laughing] I'm sure glad
my dog isn't gay!

120
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:52,478
Yeah, maybe you should
name your dog Sparkette, Stan.

121
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:55,106
[laughing]
Gay dog.

122
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,818
And so you see, Simon and Simon

123
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:00,570
were not brothers in real life,

124
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:02,446
only on television.

125
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:05,158
Thank you
for that presentation, Eric,

126
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:07,368
but the assignment
was on Asian cultures.

127
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:08,578
You get a D-minus.

128
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:10,163
Aw, damn it!

129
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:12,123
Who should we call on
next, Mr. Hat?

130
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:15,501
How about Stan, our little
South Park quarterback star?

131
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:16,711
Oh, good idea.

132
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,296
Okay, Stanley, you're next.

133
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:20,006
Um, I'm not really prepared
either.

134
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:22,466
Well, just make something up
like Eric did.

135
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:23,926
Okay, um,

136
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:25,595
Asian culture has...

137
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,180
plagued our fragile Earth
for many years.

138
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:28,264
We must end it...

139
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:29,640
Excellent. A-minus!

140
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:30,725
Hey!
Wow, cool!

141
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,767
Wait a minute!

142
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:32,768
Why the hell does he get

143
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:33,936
an A-minus?

144
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:35,313
Eric, Stanley just might

145
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:36,606
lead our team to victory

146
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:37,982
against the Middle Park Cowboys

147
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:39,650
for the first time in decades.

148
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:41,360
And we treat star athletes
better

149
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:42,737
because they're better people.

150
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:43,821
That's not fair!

151
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:44,822
Life isn't fair, kiddo.

152
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:46,115
Get used to it.

153
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,950
Stupid puppet.
[bell rings]

154
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:49,994
Don't forget your assignments
tonight, children.

155
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:52,163
They're due tomorrow
for everybody but Stan.

156
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:54,040
Mr. Garrison,
can I ask you a question?

157
00:04:54,165 --> 00:04:55,750
Of course, Stanley.
What is it?

158
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,085
What's a homosexual?

159
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,545
Oh, well, Stanley,

160
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,464
I guess you came
to the right person.

161
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,924
Sit down.

162
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:06,385
Stanley, gay people...

163
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,347
well, gay people are evil.

164
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:11,557
Evil right down
to their cold, black hearts,

165
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:13,643
which pump not blood
like yours and mine,

166
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:15,519
but rather a thick vomitus oil

167
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:17,188
that oozes through
their rotten veins

168
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:19,065
and clots
in their pea-sized brains,

169
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,192
which becomes the cause
of their Nazi-esque patterns

170
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:22,818
of violent behavior.

171
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:25,446
Do you understand?
I guess.

172
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:27,698
Good, I'm glad we could have
this little talk, Stanley.

173
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:29,200
Now you go outside
and practice football

174
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:30,993
like a good little heterosexual.

175
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:33,287
##

176
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,331
You guys see me
block that defense today?

177
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,083
I was kicking ass.

178
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,542
You're gonna need to
kick more ass than that

179
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:39,961
to beat the Cowboys.

180
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:41,921
Hey, speaking of pounding ass,

181
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:43,631
here comes Stan's
little homo dog!

182
00:05:43,756 --> 00:05:45,174
Shut up, dude!

183
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:47,134
Sparky, where'd you get
that pink scarf?

184
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,386
[barks]

185
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:49,387
Man, that is the gayest dog

186
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:50,638
I have ever seen.

187
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:51,639
He just needs some training,

188
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:52,640
that's all.

189
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:54,100
Sit, Sparky.

190
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:56,727
Good boy.
Now shake.

191
00:05:58,312 --> 00:06:00,690
Good boy.
Now don't be gay!

192
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,025
Don't be gay, Spark.

193
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,026
Don't be gay.

194
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:05,444

195
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:06,862
Did it work?
I don't know.

196
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:08,781
He still looks pretty gay to me.

197
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:11,993
Hey, Stan, your dog been
to any pride marches lately?

198
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,287
[laughing] Yeah, maybe you
should take him

199
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:15,997

201
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,667
Stupid little gay dog.
Gay dog.

202
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,419
Come on, you guys.
I have an idea.

204
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:30,136

206
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:32,763
No, sirree, I'm telling you,

207
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:34,265
I got the line.

208
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,309
My nephew Stan is
the best quarterback

209
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:37,893
the school's ever seen.

210
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:40,688
I guarantee
they'll beat the spread.

211
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:42,857
I'm gonna put all my money
on the Cows.

212
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,192
I'll put $300 on the Cows
too, if they guarantee...

213
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:48,154
Hey, I want to put some money
on the cows too.

214
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,739
Whoa, whoa!

215
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:51,782
Don't get too carried away, now.

216
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,951
You better be right
about this, Jimbo.

217
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:55,453
[chuckles] Yeah.

218
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:57,246
Uh, don't...
Don't worry yourself.

219
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:59,498
Are you sure Stan is that good?

220
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:01,667
Well, not that sure.

221
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,794
I think we better come up
with a backup plan.

222
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,671
Uh, let's see here.

223
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:07,006
Hey, bookie, what...

224
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:08,382
What's the halftime show
gonna be?

225
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:10,051
You haven't heard?

226
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,470
John Stamos' older brother
Richard Stamos

227
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:14,096
is gonna sing "Loving You".

228
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:15,556
I love that song.

229
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,933
"Loving you"?
That's perfect.

230
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,769
Come on, Ned,
Middle Park's gonna get

231
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:22,146
a halftime show
they'll never forget.

232
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:25,733
Okay, Sparky,
we got you a present.

233
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,069
Now why don't... damn it, Sparky,

234
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:29,111
where do you keep
getting this thing?

235
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:30,112
No pink bandana, Sparky.

236
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:31,113
Bad dog!

237
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:32,448
Now pay attention.

238
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:34,867
Sparky, this is Fifi.

239
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:36,243
Ooh la la!

240
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:37,495
There he goes.

241
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,288
Attaboy, Spark, get her!

242
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:41,374
Yes!

243
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:46,462
Ah, crap.
Now what do I do?

244
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:47,630
Who cares if your dog is gay?

245
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:48,839
Maybe it's not that bad.

246
00:07:48,964 --> 00:07:50,216
No way, dude, my mom says

247
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:51,926
God hates gay people.

248
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,970
That's why he smote
the sodomies in France.

[mumbling]

250
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:57,973
I know, Mr. Garrison said

251
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,600
that homosexuals
are evil, but...

252
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,185
but Sparky doesn't seem evil.

253
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,978
Well, maybe Mr. Garrison
is wrong.

254
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:03,979
You should ask somebody else.

255
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,564

00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:49,984
My son,
a lot of people have wondered

278
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:52,695
what my stance
on homosexuality is,

279
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,196

once and for all

280
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,323

I'm Big Gay Al.

this is Frank Hammond,

401
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:12,830
South Park Public Radio, AM 900.

402
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:14,289
Welcome to tonight's matchup

403
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:15,791
between the Middle Park Cowboys

404
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,626
and the South Park Cows.

405
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,753
Well, it looks like Chef,
the South Park Cows' coach,

406
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:20,796
is a little nervous.

407
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:21,839
This is probably because

408
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:22,881
his star quarterback

409
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:23,966
has yet to show up.

410
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:26,427
Oh, come on, Stan.

411
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:28,429
Uh, Mr. Chef,
if Stanley doesn't show up,

412
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:29,430
can I use his helmet?

413
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:31,014
No, Pip, I'm sorry!

414
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,850

00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:34,476

00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:37,354

417
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:38,897
You're gonna have to
quarterback, Kyle.

418
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:40,399
But I never practiced
quarterback.

419
00:13:40,524 --> 00:13:42,609
It's a little late
for that bullcrap now.

Filling in for quarterback

421
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:46,321
is number 12,
Kyle "Broslovski."

422
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,407
Hey, hey,
where's little Stanley?

423
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:50,409
Yeah, why the hell is
that little Jewish kid

424
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:51,827

00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:53,954
Ned, look.

426
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:57,458

on their sidelines.

is still attached.

Fine, how are you?

432
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,972
I'm super, thanks for asking.

433
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:13,432
My gay dog ran away
and I was wondering

434
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:14,850
if maybe he came here.

435
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:16,935
Well, let's see.
Come on in.

436
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:19,688
Do you have lots
of gay dogs here?

437
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:21,440

gay animals here

Wow, it seems like the
animals here are really happy.

Of course they are, silly buns!

447
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:39,291
It's the one place
where gay animals

448
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,584
can really be themselves.

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:41,752

your heads in.

Cartman farted!

No, I didn't!
That was just my shoes.

Come on, Kyle,

463
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:07,444
we'll get a delay of game
penalty!

464
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:10,113
No way, dude!
Hike the ball!

465
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,490
Oh, dude, weak.

466
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,033
That's right,
you get back there.

467
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:14,618
Hike!
The ball is snapped.

They run it in for a touchdown!

472

The score is 7-0,
Middle Park,

with 14:57 remaining
in the first quarter.

I haven't seen
a beating like that

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,343
Now, Frank, that's not very PC.

478

You're gonna get us

we're gonna hang you
out to dry, Jimbo.

00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:55,951

Middle Park Cowboys 52,

Now, that is not cool.

00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:23,604
Okay, Stan, I think
you should get in line

508
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:25,522
for my big gay boat ride.

509
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,816

the big gay boat ride!

On this adventure,

00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:35,532
we'll be seeing
the world of gayness

throughout time.

516
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:39,494
And the South Park Cows
are set to receive.

517
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,954
There's the kick.

518
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,749
It's taken by number 23,
Kenny McCormick.

519
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:46,543
He's at the 50,
the 40, the 30...

The little running back is down!

522
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:52,049
I think he's...

523
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,259
yes, he's been decapitated!

524
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,219
[gasps] Oh, my God,

525
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:57,512

You bastards!

527
00:16:59,556 --> 00:17:01,016
That's got to hurt, Frank!

528
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:02,017
Ouch-eroo!

00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:03,560
Hey, come on,

530
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:05,145
that was roughing!

531
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,439
At least let us
scrape him off the field!

532
00:17:07,564 --> 00:17:09,107
Looks like the South Park Cows

533
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:11,234
aren't even gonna beat
the 72-point spread,

534
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,986
not by a long shot.

535
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,988
You see, gayness has existed

536
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:16,782
since the beginning of time,

537
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:18,617
from the Egyptian pharaohs,

538
00:17:18,742 --> 00:17:20,869
to the shoguns of Japan.

539
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:23,956
Uh-oh, look out,
it's the oppressors!

540
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:26,541
Christians and Republicans
and Nazis, oh my!

541
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:27,793
[gunshot]

542
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:30,212
Oh! Oh, gosh, that was close.

543
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:32,339
Okay, let's steer
our big gay boat out of here

544
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:35,008
and into a place where gays
are allowed to live freely.

545
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:39,262
All: # We are gay
and it's okay #

546
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:41,640
# 'Cause gay means happy
and happy means gay #

547
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:43,225
# We're not sad anymore #

548
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,685
# 'Cause we're out
the closet door #

549
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,229
# It's okay to be gay #

550
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:48,605
So what do you think, Stan?

551
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,148
This kicks ass.

552
00:17:50,273 --> 00:17:51,984
I'm sorry I tried
to change you, Spark.

553
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,735
I just didn't understand.

554
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,320
Isn't this precious?

555
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:57,072
And now here to sing
the touching song

556
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:59,241
"Loving You"
is the one and only,

557
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:01,743
John Stamos' brother!

558
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:03,120
All right, Richard!

559
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:05,163
<i>[piano music]</i>

560
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:07,833
# Loving you #

561
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:12,129
# Is easy
'cause you're beautiful #

562
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:14,840
# Doot'n-doot'n doo-doo #

563
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:16,925
[off-key]
# Ahh #

564
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,510
# Ahh #

565
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:19,678
What the hell?

566
00:18:19,803 --> 00:18:21,138
He didn't sing the high F!

567
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:23,015
Richard Stamos
can't sing a high F.

568
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,975
He always screws it up
like this.

569
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,477
Ned, we are gonna
get our asses kicked!

570
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:28,979
# La, la, la, la, la #

571
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:30,439
It's obvious where
all the talent

572
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:32,441
in that family went!

573
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:36,778
Thanks for everything,
Big Gay Al.

574
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:38,113
[barks]
No problem, kids.

575
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:39,448
Are you sure
you don't want to stay

576
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:40,907
for some toasted
cheese sandwiches?

577
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,075
No thanks.
I've got to get back

578
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,160
for the big football game.

579
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:44,286
Come on, boy.

580
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:45,912
Oh, Stan...

581
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,664
when you get back to town,

582
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:49,833
tell them about us, will you?

583
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,835
Tell them there are
gay animals here

584
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,296
who need homes, desperately.

585
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:55,464
I will, Big Gay Al.

586
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:56,631
I will.

587
00:18:58,425 --> 00:19:00,510
Oh, my carrot cake.

588
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:02,888
And these South Park Cows
are being absolutely

589
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,681
molested by Middle Park.

590
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:06,725
I haven't seen so many
children molested since...

591
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,310
I thought you said
beating the spread

592
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:10,062
was a sure thing, Jimbo!

593
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:13,148
Yeah, we all put our
life savings in this game!

594
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:14,941
You're a dead man, Jimbo!

595
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:16,735
Well, this should
just about wrap it up for...

596
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,904
Wait a minute, what's this?

597
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:20,572
Yeah! Yoo-hoo!

598
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:23,033
It's Stan, the South Park
star quarterback.

599
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:25,077
Where the hell
have you been, Stan?

600
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:26,745
I've been getting
my best friend back.

601
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,455
Just get in there, boy.

602
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,040
Give 'em hell, Stanley!

603
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,710
Jesus... now, I haven't
asked you for much.

604
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,712
But all we need is
one little score.

605
00:19:35,837 --> 00:19:37,631
Please, please, Jesus.

606
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:39,049
Leave me alone.

607
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:40,467
Hike!
Stan hikes the ball.

608
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:41,802
He steps back to pass.

609
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:44,346
Hey, Stan, I'm open I think.

610
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:46,723
And he throws it to Kyle,
the little Jewish kid.

611
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:49,810
Oh, my!

612
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,269
I haven't seen a Jew
run like that

613
00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:53,021
since Poland, 1938!

614
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:54,231
Dude!

615
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:56,608
Touchdown!

616
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,318
Yeah!
Whoo!

617
00:19:58,443 --> 00:19:59,945
The clock runs out,
and the final score is

618
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,822
Middle Park Cowboys 73,

619
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:03,698
South Park Cows 6.

620
00:20:03,824 --> 00:20:06,284
South Park beats the spread.

621
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:08,829
Yeah! Yoo-hoo!

622
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:10,330
Speech!

623
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:11,998
Stan, what do you want
to tell the world

624
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:14,376
about this stunning
almost victory?

625
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:16,419
Uh, it's really cool

626
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:18,213
that we beat the spread
against the Cowboys.

627
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:19,881
Yeah, all right!

628
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:22,801
And maybe we can beat 'em
even more next year.

629
00:20:22,926 --> 00:20:24,010
Whoo!

630
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:26,221
And it's okay to be gay.

631
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:28,473
What?

632
00:20:28,598 --> 00:20:30,308
Being gay is just part of nature

633
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:31,768
and a beautiful thing.

634
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:33,728
What the hell is
he talking about?

635
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:36,148
Uh, Stanley, you arrived
very late in the game.

636
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:37,816
Where were you that whole time?

637
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:39,943
I was with my new friend,
Big Gay Al.

638
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:41,862
He showed me
his big gay animal sanctuary

639
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:43,572
and took me
on a big gay boat ride,

640
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:45,991
where I learned all about
the wonders of gaiety.

641
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:49,494
It's true.
I'll show you.

642
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,249
But it was here.
It was all right here.

643
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,293
There... there was
a techno dance club.

644
00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,295
Stan, you need to lay off
the cough syrup.

645
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,671
All right?
Seriously.

646
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:01,047
I'm worried about you, man.

647
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,465
Oliver!

648
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,717
I thought you ran away

649
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:05,427
all those months ago.

650
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:06,428
Sidney!

651
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:07,429
Willie!

652
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:08,847
Carlos!

653
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:10,182
I want to thank you so much

654
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:11,850
for bringing everybody here.

655
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:14,269
Oh, there you are, dude.
How's it going?

656
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:16,563
I'm super, thanks for asking.

657
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:18,815
It looks like now
my work here is done.

658
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:22,986
Good-bye, Stanley.
Peace be with you.

659
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:24,029
Wow!

660
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:26,907
[shimmering tone]

661
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:29,367
You guys, you guys!
I can do it.

662
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:30,368
Do what?

663
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:32,078
# Loving you #

664
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:34,915
# Is easy 'cause
you're beautiful #

666
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,375
Both: No!

667
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,627
# Ahh #

668
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,589
<i># Now you're a man #</i>
