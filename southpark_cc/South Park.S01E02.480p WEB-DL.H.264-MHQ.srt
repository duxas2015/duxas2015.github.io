# Humble folks

# Going down to South Park #

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,421
# Gonna leave my woes behind #

# So come on down
to South Park #

# And meet some

15
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:39,314
Hey, Stan, did you see that
rainbow this morning?

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,899
Yeah, it was huge.

17
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,776
Ugh, I hate those things.

18
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,486
Nobody hates rainbows.

19
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,696
Yeah, what's there to hate
about rainbows?

20
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:49,783
Well, you know, you'll just
be sitting there

21
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:52,786
minding your own business, and
they'll come marching in

22
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:54,913
and crawl up your leg and
start biting

23
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:56,248
the inside of your ass.

24
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,250
And you'll be all like, "Hey,

25
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,628
get out of my ass, you stupid
rainbows."

26
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:05,090
Cartman, what the hell are
you talking about?

27
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:07,008
I'm talking about rainbows.

28
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,802
I hate those friggin' things.

29
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:10,262
Rainbows are those arches of
color

30
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:11,638
that show up during a rainstorm.

31
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:15,141
Oh, rainbows.

32
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,309
Oh, yeah, I like those.

33
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:17,560
Those are cool.

34
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:18,812
What were you talking about?

35
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:20,897
Heh? Oh, nothing. Forget it.

36
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:23,066
No, what marches in, crawls
up your leg...

37
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:24,317
Nothing.
And bites the inside

38
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:26,319
of your ass?
Nothing.

39
00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:28,363
Children, children, remember
the Save Our Fragile Planet

40
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,448
essay contest that you
children worked

41
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:32,242
so hard on last month?

42
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:36,913
One of our very own South Park
students has won

43
00:01:37,038 --> 00:01:38,331
the national prize.

44
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:39,499
[all gasp]

45
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:41,584
Wow, I knew I would win.

46
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,212
Gosh, Mr. Garrison, this sure
is exciting.

47
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,047
That's right, Mr. Hat.

48
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,757
The winner of the national
Save Our Fragile Planet

49
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:51,177
contest is... Eric Cartman.

50
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:52,721
What?
What?

51
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,389
Congratulations, Eric, on
writing

52
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,016
the award-winning paper.

53
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:57,434
Kick ass.

54
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,311
That's impossible.

55
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,271
Cartman doesn't know a rain
forest from a Pop-Tart.

56
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:03,606
Yeah, I do.
Pop-Tarts are frosted.

57
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,692
Out of over a million papers,

58
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:08,111
Eric's was chosen as the
grand prize winner.

59
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:10,196
Wow, what did you write
about, Cartman?

60
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:12,490
Oh, you know, this and that.

61
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:14,617
He doesn't even know
what he wrote about.

62
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,536
What was your paper about,
Wendy?

63
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,914
My paper was on the suffering
of bottle-nosed dolphins.

64
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,583
Well, you see, you shouldn't
have written

65
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,043
a paper about dolphins.

66
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:24,961
Dolphins are stupid.

67
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:26,629
Dude, dolphins are, like, the
second-smartest animal

68
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:27,714
on the planet.

69
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:29,382
[scoffs] Oh, right.

70
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:31,843
If they're so damn smart,
how come they get caught

71
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:34,012
in those fishing nets all the
time?

72
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:36,014
What?
Wait, wait, there's more.

73
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:38,808
It says here that Eric's trophy

74
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:42,354
will be presented to him by...

75
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,105
Kathie Lee Gifford?

76
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,232
Kathie Lee is coming to South
Park?

77
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:49,277
And the presentation will be
on national television.

78
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,737
Both: Television?

79
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:53,239
<i>Kathie Lee Gifford.</i>

80
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:54,824
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

81
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:58,411
Kathie Lee Gifford in South
Park.

82
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,372
Oh, my God.

83
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:03,291
This is our chance to make a
name for ourselves, to show

84
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,835
that we're not some pissant,
white-bread mountain town.

85
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,671
Better yet, it's a chance for
you to get some publicity.

86
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:12,050
Yes, if I can show just how
much I've turned South Park

87
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,386
around, I could become a
senator.

88
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,304
Maybe even a state senator.

89
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,723
Mayor, we should decorate the
town square.

90
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:21,393
Then we should have the chef
of the school cafeteria sing

91
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:24,396
a song and play up the ethnic
diversity of our town.

92
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,605
That's right.

93
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,232
He's a black guy, isn't he?

94
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,150
Black as the night itself,
Mayor.

95
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,320
Yes, and we can even have the
children of South Park

96
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:33,696
put on a little play.

97
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,698
Kathie Lee loves children.

98
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,492
If they're working in a
sweatshop, that is.

99
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,743
Oh!
Ouch.

100
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:40,745
[laughs]
Thank you.

101
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,622
You guys, guess what.

102
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:46,376
After I'm on television,
I'm gonna be totally famous.

103
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:48,253
Hitler was famous too.

104
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:49,379
Hello there, children.

105
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:50,880
Both: Hey, Chef.

106
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:52,132
How are my little crackers
today?

107
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:53,591
Good.

108
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:55,301
Did y'all hear about the news?

109
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:56,970
Kathie Lee Gifford is
coming to South Park.

110
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:58,388
Yeah, 'cause Cartman cheated
and won

111
00:03:58,513 --> 00:03:59,973
the environmental essay contest.

112
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:01,599
Hey!
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

113
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:04,519
But the mayor just called and
asked me

114
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,312
to sing at the ceremony.

115
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:07,772
Wow, are you gonna do it?

116
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:09,774
Of course.

117
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:13,445
Kathie Lee is a beautiful,
sultry queen of sexual fantasy.

118
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,822
And if I sing to her, maybe I
can lure her into

119
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:19,409
a night of exotic delectation.

120
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:21,161
Yeah, that'd be cool.

121
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:23,037
[mumbling indistinctly]

122
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,583
Well, three times bigger than
Frank Gifford's, anyway.

123
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,169
Oh, I can't even concentrate
on grading papers

124
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:30,879
with all this excitement.

125
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,674
Why are you looking at me like
that, Mr. Hat?

126
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:37,135
Have you forgotten about all
the pain and suffering

127
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,179
that Kathie Lee Gifford caused
you?

128
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:42,265
Mr. Hat, that was a long time
ago, and...

129
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,975
And I was only a child.

130
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,894
We could've won that
talent show.

131
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,687
We could've been huge.

132
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,147
Knock-knock, Mr. Hat.

133
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:51,024
Who's there?
Orange.

134
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:52,567
Orange who?

135
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,944
Orange you glad
I didn't say banana?

136
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,865
Thank you.

137
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,203
Wow, Mr. Hat, looks like we
might win.

138
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:09,501
And now, our last talent show
finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein.

139
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:12,587
# If they could see me now,
that little gang of mine #

140
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,006
# I'm eating fancy chow
and drinking fancy wine #

141
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:17,550
# I'd like those stumble bums
to see for a fact #

142
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:20,595
# The kind of top-drawer
first-rate chums I attract #

143
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,264
# All I can say is wowee,
look at where I am #

144
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,100
# Tonight I landed pow
right in a pot of jam #

145
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,770
# What a setup, holy cow,
they'd never believe it #

146
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,023
# If my friends
could see me now #

147
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:33,525
[fireworks booming]

148
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,485
[cheers and applause]

149
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:40,698
It wasn't fair.

150
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,450
She had choreography.

151
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,327
How could we compete with that?

152
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:46,579
But now she's coming to
South Park,

153
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:48,873
and I know a way to
make it all better.

154
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:50,291
How?
[gasps]

155
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,544
No, Mr. Hat.

156
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,462
I couldn't...

157
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:58,508
kill Kathie Lee Gifford.

158
00:06:01,386 --> 00:06:03,137
Children, as you all know,

159
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,641
Ms. Kathie Lee Gifford will be
in South Park to present

160
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,726
the award to some kid for an
essay.

161
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:10,687
That kid is me.
Whatever.

162
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:13,940
Now, I'm going to have you
luscious little youngsters

163
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:17,402
do a play about the history of
South Park.

164
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,779
That'll be wonderful, won't
it, Mr. Hat?

165
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:21,781
Kill her. Mr. Hat.

166
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:25,034
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you
to direct our little play.

167
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,744
Oh, that's perfect.

168
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,247
You see, Mr. Hat, we don't have
to kill her.

169
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:30,999
We can just upstage her.

170
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,458
Mrs. Mayor,

171
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:34,002
you might want to
review the essays.

172
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,878
We think Cartman might
have cheated.

173
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:37,797
Who cares?

174
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:42,552
Now, kids, what's say we give
it our South Park best?

175
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,347
And who's
our little prizewinner again?

176
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,141
Me, Eric Cartman.

177
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:49,976
How about we get in shape, huh?

178
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,854
We want to look our best for
the TV cameras, don't we?

179
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,230
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:55,940
# I'm gonna be on television #

181
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:58,067
# I'm gonna be on television #

# I'm gonna be on television #

00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,656
# I'm gonna be on television #

184
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:05,241
We don't believe for a
minute that you won that

185
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:06,951
contest fairly, fat boy.

186
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:09,078
Ugh, stop defending your
little girlfriend

187
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:11,414
for writing about
some stupid fish.

188
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:13,833
Dude, dolphins are
intelligent and friendly.

189
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,419
Intelligent and friendly on
rye bread with some mayonnaise.

190
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:18,254
Dolphins are way smarter
than you.

191
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,965
If they're so smart, why do
they live in igloos?

192
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,300
Dolphins don't live in igloos.

193
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:23,593
That's Eskimos.

194
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:25,303
Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?

195
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,972
It's all a bunch of
tree-hugging hippie crap.

196
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:29,223
Tell me what you wrote about.

197
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,600
I can't.

198
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:31,976
I have to go home and get
in shape.

199
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,436
Yeah, right.

200
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:34,937
You'll go and sit in front
of the TV

201
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:36,481
and eat Cheesy Poofs,
ass-master.

202
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:38,107
Screw you, hippie.

203
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,820
<i>We'll be right back to
"Jesus and Pals" after this.</i>

204
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,156
<i>Hey, do you need to get in
shape fast?</i>

205
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,949
<i>Wanna look your best?</i>

206
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:48,701
<i>Tired of the other guys
getting all the chicks?</i>

207
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:50,286
<i>Are you tired of
being a 90-pound weakling?</i>

208
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:52,455
Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.

Mom, can you get me some

222
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,486
Okay, Eric, I'll get you some
at the store tomorrow.

223
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:26,614
But, Mom, I need it for
tomorrow.

224
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,575
But tomorrow is
grocery day, Eric.

225
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:32,412
Mom.
[whining]

226
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:34,288
Okay, okay.

227
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,999
Well, I guess I'll be going
to the store now, then.

No! No!

231
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,927
Kill her.

232
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:50,138
No, Mr. Hat. I won't do it.

233
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,808
Kill.

234
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,435
That does it.

235
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,896
You're going in the
dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.

236
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:01,607
She'll make a fool of you again.

237
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:04,152
Well, you can just stay in that
drawer, negative Nancy.

238
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,862
Hey, dudes.

239
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:07,530
What the hell is wrong with
you, Cartman?

240
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:08,781
Haven't you noticed the
three feet of snow

241
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,742
on the ground?

242
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,827
Listen, I have a nice body,
and I want to show it off.

243
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,412
You got that?

244
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,205
What?
You've got to weigh 90 pounds.

245
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,541
I'm up to 94, thank
you very much.

246
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,293
[mumbling indistinctly]

247
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:22,545
Yeah, they're almost as big
as his mom's.

249
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:25,548
Laugh all you want.

I'll the one who's gonna be on
TV looking all buff.

What's that stuff?
Weight Gain 4000.

252
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,263
It's helping me bulk up.

253
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:34,056
Bulk up to what, fat-ass?

254
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:35,725
Super fat-ass?

255
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,477
Hey, I don't have to take
that kind of crap

256
00:09:37,602 --> 00:09:40,855
from you scrawny weaklings.

258
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:44,442
Sweet, check me out.

259
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:47,820
I'm such a beefcake I can't
get through the door.

260
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:49,405
Come on, people.

261
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,407
We've got to turn
this place around.

262
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:54,076
Hang up the lights, string up
the banners,

263
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,745
castrate the cows.

00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,538
[cows mooing]

265
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:01,042
Well, Mr. Garrison, how is the
little play going?

266
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,710
Huh? Oh, fine.

267
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,170
We were just about to
run it from the top.

268
00:10:04,295 --> 00:10:05,630
Oh, please do.

269
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:07,632
I'm dying to see it.

270
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:11,177
Okay, all the little pioneers
on this side of the stage.

271
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:13,054
Good, and all the little Indians

272
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,722
go to the center of the stage.

273
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,183
Am I an Indian or a pioneer?

274
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:18,643
Do you have a feather on your
head?

275
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:20,603
Yes.
Then you're an Indian.

276
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:21,854
Oh.

277
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:23,731
Okay, Bebe, this is your line.

278
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,276
This is the story of South Park.

279
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:30,404
It begins over 100 years ago

280
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,409
when the noble and hearty Ute
Indians lived on the land.

281
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:38,955
[drums thumping]

282
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,624
Oh, don't they look adorable?

283
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:45,711
Then from the East came the
great white pioneers.

284
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:49,966
[together]
Ahh!

285
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,552
Oh, my God.

286
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:54,387
They did it
a lot better this morning.

287
00:10:54,512 --> 00:10:55,930
They had more energy.

288
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,724
The pioneers met with the
Indians

289
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,020
and negotiated for
their fertile lands.

290
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,606
Mr. Garrison, we cannot have
our children

291
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,484
beating each other senseless
in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.

292
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:10,069
Well, what do you want?

293
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:11,654
This is how it happened
in those days.

294
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,031
Take that, you stupid Indian.
Ohh.

295
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:17,410
Mr. Garrison, this is not
appropriate.

296
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:20,329
Do you actually think that
Kathie Lee Gifford

297
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:21,873
would enjoy this?

298
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:23,624
To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford.

299
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,751
[all gasp]

300
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:28,129
[gasps]
Oh, my God. What have I said?

301
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,090
He said, "To hell with Kathie
Lee Gifford."

302
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:36,846
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing
you from directing our play.

303
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:39,056
[crickets chirping]

304
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,225
It happened again, didn't it?

305
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,353
Now we do things my way.

306
00:11:44,478 --> 00:11:47,398
I can't kill her, Mr. Hat.

307
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:50,067
You're gonna have to do it.

308
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,904
[cackling]

309
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,326
Whoa, Cartman, talk
about wide load.

310
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,203
Yeah, I'm really starting to
fill out nicely.

311
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:02,914
You're not filling out nicely.

312
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,206
You're fatter than ever.

313
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:05,291
I'm not fat.

314
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,043
I'm getting in shape.

315
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,878
Cartman, you're such a
fat-ass that when you walk

316
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:10,880
down the street, people go,
"God damn it.

317
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:12,506
That's a big fat-ass."

318
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,884
No, they don't, you
jealous weakling.

319
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,595
God damn,
that's a big fat-ass.

320
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,221
Hey!

321
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:21,974
Hi, guys.
Oh, look, another hippie.

322
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:23,935
Peace, Wendy.
Shut up, Cartman.

323
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,686
Oh.

324
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,438
# Two little hippies
sitting in a tree #

325
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:29,398
I'm gonna find Cartman's paper

326
00:12:29,523 --> 00:12:31,817
and get to the bottom of this.

327
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:34,695
Can I help you?

328
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,988
Yes.

329
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:37,782
I need a gun.

330
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:40,409
Would this be for hunting or
protection or other?

331
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,078
Other.
Alrighty then.

332
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:44,830
May I suggest a Stratford
12-millimeter?

333
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,582
Go ahead.
Try it on.

334
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:48,834
That looks really nice on you.

335
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,253
The lacquered black
really matches your eyes.

336
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,755
You talking to me?

337
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,757
You talking to me?

338
00:12:54,882 --> 00:12:56,717
I don't know,
it's a little small.

339
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,011
Okay.
How about this?

340
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:00,596
You talking to me?

341
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:02,723
Hmm, no, I don't like this one
either.

342
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,351
Here's the same gun
with a wood finish.

343
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:06,811
You talking to me?

344
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,604
I don't see anybody else
around here,

345
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:11,107
so you must be talking to me.

346
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:12,525
I'll take it.

347
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,527
Hello?

00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,767
Well, Mr. Hat, I guess old
Kathie Lee really will be

354
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,728
surprised when she gets here
tomorrow.

355
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:52,064
She beat us in the talent
show all those years ago.

356
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:54,483
And I think we owe her for that.

357
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:56,068
Ba-bang!

Thank you.

Nice gun, Mr. Garrison.

Hello, Officer Barbrady.

Nice gun.
Thanks.

367
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,715
Is there somewhere in town
where I can get a good,

368
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,800
clear shot... or a view of Kathie
Lee?

369
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:23,262
Hmm, you know, I think the
book depository

370
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:25,014
would be a good bet.

Ha! Caught you red-handed!

00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:37,610
No pictures of Kathie Lee.

Where is she?

This is sweet.

be able to get

all of you in frame, Cartman.

You guys, we have to stop him.

Stop who?
Mr. Garrison.

385
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:58,589
He's going to try to
kill Kathie Lee Gifford.

Oh, no, you don't.

387

You're not gonna ruin my
moment of fame.

388
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:04,011
He's got a gun.

jealousy thing, all right?

It just so happens that I
have your paper,

There's something more
important right now.

Wendy, you've got to prioritize.

What's more important, being
on TV

398
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,073
or some stupid assassination?

honor that I'd like to welcome

will sing a special song in
honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford.

Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:20,296
You know, Kathie Lee, you are
a very special woman.

419
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:23,257
I don't mean special in a Mary
Tyler Moore way

420
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:28,053
or special in an extra-value
meal at Happy Burger way.

421
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,638
No, no, no, no, no.

422
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:31,432
I mean special,

423
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,934
like the song of the
hummingbird as it gets ready

424
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,896
to find that female hummingbird

425
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:39,690
and make sweet love to it all
night long.

426
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:43,360
Just two hummingbirds moaning
and groaning and

427
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:45,112
letting their bodies caress

428
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,073
and touch each other in ecstasy.

# How about you and me #

00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,468
Thank you, Chef,
for that heartwarming song.

437
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,221
# Get it together
and make sweet love? #

Mr. Garrison is about to kill
Kathie Lee.

00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:21,106
We have to find him.

00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:23,234
What?
You mean the teacher?

445
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,236
Wait a minute.

446
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:27,571
Is there somewhere in town
where I can get a good, clear

447
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:29,782
shot...
Or a view of Kathie Lee?

448
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:32,743
Hmm, you know, I think the
book depository

449
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,662
would be a good bet.

450
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,289
I think the book depository
would be a good bet.

00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:40,668
Book depository, depository,
book depository, depository.

452
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,544
Damn, he could be anywhere.

453
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,505
I'll send out an APB.

454
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,756
Wendy, look.

455
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:50,177
And now, here to
present the award

456
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,306
for the environmental essay to
our own Eric Kaufman...

457
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,183
Cartman, God damn it.

458
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,228
Is your favorite celebrity
and mine,

459
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:02,731
Kathie Lee Gifford.

I love you all.

462
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,614
Mr. Garrison, stop.

463
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,157
Leave us.

464
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:14,159
We must finish what
we have begun.

465
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:16,161
I know that she's hurt you.

466
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:17,579
She's hurt a lot of people.

467
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:19,206
You can't know.

468
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,583
You should've won
that talent show.

469
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,378
It is with a great honor and
pride that I present

470
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,255
the winner this trophy.

471
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,340
Eric, would you please come
up here?

472
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:31,969
Here it is, my big
moment of fame.

473
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:34,596
And then she finished it
all by throwing her voice

474
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:36,515
with two dummies at once.

475
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,310
I know that, Mr. Garrison,
but this isn't the answer.

476
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:42,896
It is too late for
me, young Wendy.

477
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:47,359
You see, I've learned
something today.

478
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:49,278
You can't win all the time.

479
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:51,989
And if you don't win, you
certainly can't hold it against

480
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:55,117
the person who did, because
that's the only way

481
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:56,994
you ever really lose.

482
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,413
You're... you're right.

483
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,540
Good.

484
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:04,501
Man, did she really throw her
voice with two dummies at once?

485
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,128
The bitch must die.

486
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,798
Ahh!
[gunshot]

487
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:11,759
[mumbles indistinctly]

488
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,223
Oh, my God.
They killed Kenny.

489
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:20,184
You bastard.

490
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:21,769
Gun!
Gun!

491
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,479
Hey, come back.

492
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:25,064
We didn't even get to do
our play.

493
00:19:25,189 --> 00:19:26,899
All: Aww.

494
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:28,650
I guess that's it, guys.
Wrap it up.

495
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,819
Hey, wait a minute.

496
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:32,780
When do I get to be on
television?

497
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,114
Forget it, kid.

498
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,824
No Kathie Lee, no
public interest.

499
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:39,411
But I won the environmental
essay contest.

500
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:42,039
You don't
deserve to win, Cartman,

501
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:43,707
and you know it.

502
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:46,460
I'm holding Cartman's
award-winning paper.

503
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,879
It's actually nothing more
than "Walden"

504
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:51,090
with Henry David Thoreau's
name crossed out

505
00:19:51,215 --> 00:19:53,550
and Cartman's
name written in its place.

506
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:55,052
Who cares?

507
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:56,845
Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.

508
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,139
What about not holding
anything against

509
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,432
the person who wins?

510
00:20:00,557 --> 00:20:02,976
Well, not if it's Cartman.

511
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,479
Hey, where are you all going?

512
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,190
They don't even know what
"Walden" is.

513
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:12,111
I bet if "Walden" was a sitcom
you'd all know what it was.

514
00:20:12,236 --> 00:20:13,862
Come on, Wendy.

515
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:15,280
Kyle's mom will make us
tuna fish sandwiches.

516
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:16,782
Oh, what the hell.

517
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:19,660
[sobbing] No, no.

518
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,621
Now I'll be stuck in
this Podunk town forever

519
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:25,916
with all these stupid, hick,
redneck, jobless,

520
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,918
truck-driving idiots.

521
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:30,546
Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.

522
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:33,215
Thought you could get
away with it, eh, Mr. Hat?

523
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,716
Well, I would have gotten
away with it

524
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,552
if it weren't
for those meddling kids.

525
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:38,470
You're lucky you missed
Kathie Lee Gifford

526
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:41,014
and that nobody got hurt.

527
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:45,602
We hope you can come
back to school real soon,

528
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,438
Mr. Garrison.

529
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:48,939
Well, children, I'd love to,
but the doctors say

530
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:50,941
that Mr. Hat needs more
therapy.

531
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,318
We can still get her.

532
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:56,196
I'm just so sorry that I ruined
everyone's chances

533
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,656
for being on TV.

534
00:20:57,781 --> 00:20:58,866
Not Cartman.

535
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,367
He gets to be on TV anyway.

536
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,119
Really? On what?

537
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:06,206
Obesity, adiposity, corpulence.

538
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,334
Whatever word you use, it
represents one thing:

539
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,253
being a big fat-ass.

540
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:14,006
We have with us today live via
satellite Eric Cartman

541
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:15,966
from South Park,

542
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:19,386
who is now so obese, he can't
even get out of his house.

543
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,680
When is this gonna be on the
air?

544
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:25,058
Is there anything you'd like
to say to people out there?

545
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:27,102
Follow your dreams.

546
00:21:27,227 --> 00:21:29,021
You can reach your goals.

547
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:30,606
I'm living proof.

548
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:32,774
Beefcake. Beefcake!

549
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,277
He needs to run his ass
around the block a few times.

550
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:38,572
Mmm, how about a little more
of that good loving, Chef?

551
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,240
Damn, woman.

552
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,117
I just gave you sweet
loving five minutes ago.

553
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:43,994
You trying to kill me?
