01:27.208 --> 01:29.038
Ask a historian,

01:29.062 --> 01:31.921
"What was mankind's greatest invention?"

01:32.505 --> 01:35.341
Fire? The wheel? The sword?

01:35.425 --> 01:37.719
I would argue it's history itself.

01:37.802 --> 01:40.013
History isn't fact.

01:40.096 --> 01:43.933
It's narrative,
one carefully curated and shaped.

01:44.392 --> 01:46.853
Under the pen strokes
of the right scribe,

01:46.936 --> 01:48.717
a villain becomes a hero,

01:49.689 --> 01:52.025
a lie becomes the truth.

01:54.069 --> 01:55.653
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

01:55.737 --> 01:58.477
- Where did we come from?
- Trantor.

01:58.907 --> 02:01.409
No, before that.

02:01.493 --> 02:05.205
Where did people come from
in the beginning?

02:05.288 --> 02:07.248
There are lots of different theories.

02:07.332 --> 02:10.170
Most of them say that humans originally
inhabited

02:10.198 --> 02:12.420
a single planetary system.

02:12.771 --> 02:13.938
Only one?

02:14.297 --> 02:18.551
And we don't even know which.
Sirius, Alpha Centauri…

02:18.635 --> 02:21.375
Some people think that we came
from some place called Earth.

02:21.805 --> 02:23.181
Come here. Come.

02:24.766 --> 02:26.768
So, everyone we know about,

02:27.977 --> 02:32.094
they also came from the same place?
Anacreons and Thespins too?

02:32.357 --> 02:34.359
Anacreons and Thespins too, yeah.

02:35.652 --> 02:37.153
Then how can they hate us?

02:40.490 --> 02:43.952
Being human is complicated, Sal.

02:45.078 --> 02:48.873
We share a common origin
and some of the same myths.

02:48.957 --> 02:51.793
But we're governed by this.

02:52.335 --> 02:56.256
In here is all the capacity
for rational thinking,

02:57.006 --> 03:00.635
but it's sharing skull space
with our emotions.

03:01.845 --> 03:05.473
And sometimes
emotions shout louder than logic.

03:06.599 --> 03:09.686
And somebody's
emotions got real insistent

03:09.710 --> 03:11.980
that the Empire were doing them wrong.

03:12.316 --> 03:14.193
So they blew up the Star Bridge.

03:14.983 --> 03:15.984
Yeah.

03:18.027 --> 03:23.825
Violence is the last refuge
of the incompetent.

03:23.908 --> 03:27.454
So, they're not like us
at all then, right?

03:28.037 --> 03:30.540
It gets loud up inside here too,
doesn't it?

03:30.623 --> 03:31.958
I guess it does.

03:33.084 --> 03:34.544
Come here. Come here.

03:35.712 --> 03:37.297
Here's the thing, Sal.

03:42.552 --> 03:48.295
Millions of people died
when that Star Bridge came down.

03:49.893 --> 03:56.107
And the Empire killed many millions more
on Anacreon and Thespis.

03:56.649 --> 03:57.859
And who won?

03:57.942 --> 03:59.694
- Nobody?
- Nobody.

04:01.154 --> 04:04.699
And that's how we know
that the fall is bound to happen.

04:07.060 --> 04:11.565
Past behavior is the best predictor
of future performance.

04:12.123 --> 04:14.376
Salvor Hardin…

04:21.216 --> 04:23.038
We're jumping.

05:12.684 --> 05:13.685
Lewis?

05:18.489 --> 05:19.866
Lewis, where are you?

05:24.571 --> 05:25.613
Terminus?

05:26.564 --> 05:27.815
We're home.

05:30.201 --> 05:31.536
We jumped back home.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.041
Lewis?

05:51.681 --> 05:52.682
Damn it.

05:57.062 --> 05:58.605
You saved us.

06:00.106 --> 06:01.441
You wished us home.

06:43.650 --> 06:45.026
Thank you.

07:07.215 --> 07:08.487
Terminus Control,

07:08.511 --> 07:11.706
this is Salvor Hardin,
on board the imperial warship Invictus.

07:11.886 --> 07:12.971
Do you read me?

07:14.639 --> 07:16.558
Terminus Control, do you read me?

07:16.981 --> 07:18.524
This is Salvor Hardin.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.066
Can anybody hear me?

07:44.335 --> 07:47.464
This is Salvor Hardin calling
the Thespin lancers.

07:47.547 --> 07:51.968
The Invictus jumped and we've dragged
your ships into our quantum wake.

07:53.261 --> 07:55.055
We're in orbit around Terminus.

07:57.807 --> 07:59.136
If you can hear me,

07:59.160 --> 08:02.465
I have no idea how to stop
this ship from jumping again.

08:03.855 --> 08:06.399
It could be an hour from now.
It could be days.

08:08.735 --> 08:10.570
I figure I'm stuck here, unless…

08:35.141 --> 08:36.143
The Beggar.

08:38.938 --> 08:40.350
How do you get home?

08:42.434 --> 08:43.770
Take me through your route.

08:47.148 --> 08:49.317
Where does this corridor go?

08:49.943 --> 08:51.694
The underground irrigation system.

08:51.778 --> 08:54.272
But there's a path
above it you could take

08:54.296 --> 08:55.949
through the old palace ruins.

08:56.032 --> 08:58.827
You end up at the servants' exit,
right next to the palace gates.

08:58.852 --> 09:00.178
So, if I could exit here…

09:00.203 --> 09:02.455
Hyperloop station's just there.

09:02.539 --> 09:04.791
Gate security has DNA scanners.

09:06.167 --> 09:08.107
I'll need the signal damper.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.998
For my nanobots. So they can't track me.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.577
I think I can get you one.

09:14.926 --> 09:16.678
I don't wanna die in this place.

09:18.680 --> 09:19.806
You won't.

09:22.016 --> 09:23.935
I can't promise it'll all go right.

09:24.728 --> 09:27.425
All I can promise is
I won't be the part that goes wrong.

09:29.566 --> 09:31.025
I have to go. Brother Dusk is...

09:31.050 --> 09:32.093
Cleon...

09:33.153 --> 09:36.448
I wish you had another name.
One that was just yours.

09:38.783 --> 09:40.243
Tomorrow you can give me one.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.589
Get me that signal damper,
and I'll see you on the other side.

10:00.722 --> 10:02.599
My apologies, Brother Dusk. I was, uh...

10:02.682 --> 10:06.436
I understand. Time flows
differently when you're young.

10:07.896 --> 10:10.815
I, uh... I want to share
something with you.

10:14.152 --> 10:17.363
This is my workplace, as you know.

10:18.698 --> 10:24.412
The signature task of Dusk
is to record our visual history.

10:26.539 --> 10:28.375
The end of the Robot Wars.

10:30.668 --> 10:32.670
The Golden Horse Rebellion.

10:32.754 --> 10:37.217
Each moment an inflection point
for our dynasty,

10:37.300 --> 10:41.429
when the fate of the galaxy
seemed to be hanging in the balance.

10:45.392 --> 10:46.851
As it did here…

10:52.649 --> 10:57.487
When I chastened the barbarian worlds
for their acts of savagery.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.155
And even while I was painting it,

10:59.239 --> 11:05.495
I was conscious of how we,
as its authors, would be represented.

11:07.789 --> 11:12.210
A clever artist provides commentary
with his work.

11:13.837 --> 11:19.592
Even something as simple as a, uh,
choice of color

11:21.052 --> 11:22.929
can convey a hidden meaning.

11:24.097 --> 11:27.642
And sometimes the
moment's not so obvious.

11:28.351 --> 11:30.520
Sometimes it slips past us,

11:30.603 --> 11:33.398
and you don't even realize it
until it is past,

11:33.898 --> 11:38.194
until your debut on
the wall is upon you.

11:40.572 --> 11:43.450
I've painted you into our legacy.

11:53.710 --> 11:54.794
Our hunt.

11:56.921 --> 11:59.507
Do you see
the three ghillie raptors you shot?

12:03.303 --> 12:04.554
Of course.

12:06.264 --> 12:08.558
I've dreamed of one day doing something,

12:09.142 --> 12:11.770
anything, worthy enough
to be included in this mural.

12:13.688 --> 12:15.732
I don't know why this small feat is…

12:19.277 --> 12:22.280
I'm honored. Thank you.

12:26.284 --> 12:29.037
I knew you had
the greatness of Cleon I in you.

12:32.499 --> 12:34.042
But during our hunt,

12:35.585 --> 12:41.257
I realized there was something else
inside you as well.

12:43.218 --> 12:47.180
I'll leave you to reflect
on your own glorious moment.

12:47.972 --> 12:49.391
Take your time.

12:51.267 --> 12:53.144
Appreciate the subtleties.

13:34.018 --> 13:37.522
What we choose
to tell our children and what we censor.

13:40.066 --> 13:42.944
What we illuminate
and what we gloss over.

13:46.865 --> 13:50.285
History as an act
of addition and subtraction.

14:27.322 --> 14:31.701
Empire, you're needed
in the Principium Tower.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.024
I-I can't. I'm busy.

14:35.538 --> 14:36.956
Brother Dusk insists.

14:37.582 --> 14:39.167
I'm indisposed.

14:39.250 --> 14:42.407
I need a minute alone,
and I'll come along. One minute.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.951
I am also Empire, you know.

14:45.298 --> 14:46.383
Yes, Empire.

14:47.342 --> 14:48.843
But we both serve.

15:03.108 --> 15:06.180
I forgot something. I need to go back.

15:07.946 --> 15:08.947
It can wait.

16:02.250 --> 16:05.045
Lock down the entrance.

16:08.965 --> 16:11.843
Don't let anyone in or out.

16:11.926 --> 16:14.220
There's a path you can take
through the palace ruins.

16:18.516 --> 16:21.770
You end up at the servants' exit,
right next to the palace gates.

16:25.523 --> 16:28.388
This route takes you
to the underground irrigation system.

16:29.527 --> 16:31.154
Hyperloop station's just there.

16:31.237 --> 16:32.697
Spread out.

17:05.146 --> 17:07.857
Warning. Water cycling imminent.

17:08.775 --> 17:11.514
Warning. Water cycling imminent.

17:50.310 --> 17:52.187
Four moons, that's a long jump.

17:56.030 --> 17:57.449
Go.

18:41.701 --> 18:42.952
Beggar, wake the hell up.

18:43.495 --> 18:45.747
Welcome aboard, Captain Hardin.

19:57.527 --> 19:58.528
Excuse me?

20:09.164 --> 20:13.168
It's an imperial aura. For your jacket?

20:31.061 --> 20:35.231
Can you tell me how to get
to the Desnian Sector on level 33?

20:35.315 --> 20:41.223
Take the Cobalt Line down,
then transfer to Ery Loop.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.991
You wanna head inner core.

20:56.419 --> 20:58.505
Beggar, open a channel
to Terminus Control.

20:58.588 --> 21:00.298
Communications channel open.

21:00.382 --> 21:02.509
Terminus Control,
this is Salvor Hardin. Come in.

21:05.428 --> 21:06.429
Damn it.

21:07.806 --> 21:10.350
Beggar, scan all frequencies.
Find me anyone on comms.

21:10.433 --> 21:12.268
Scanning.

21:13.853 --> 21:15.730
No active comms detected

21:15.814 --> 21:17.357
on the surface of Terminus.

21:24.823 --> 21:25.907
You found someone?

21:25.990 --> 21:29.369
Caution. Anomalous debris
on potential intercept trajectory.

21:29.452 --> 21:30.745
Threat level low.

21:33.998 --> 21:35.250
What the hell is that?

21:35.333 --> 21:38.586
Alert. Anomalous debris
on confirmed intercept trajectory.

21:38.670 --> 21:40.074
Threat level moderate.

21:40.255 --> 21:41.951
I need guns. Where are the guns?

21:43.717 --> 21:45.635
Beggar, show me the guns.

21:46.511 --> 21:49.514
Warning. Anomalous debris
object impact imminent.

21:49.597 --> 21:51.891
Threat level severe. Warning.

21:51.975 --> 21:53.170
Target locked.

21:53.893 --> 21:56.132
Babe? Babe, are you there?

21:57.021 --> 21:58.523
Hugo, is that you?

22:13.663 --> 22:16.166
Our plan worked, Sal.

22:18.251 --> 22:19.753
How'd you get here from the Belt?

22:20.587 --> 22:21.880
Luck, mostly.

22:21.963 --> 22:23.997
I made contact with Thespin Command.

22:24.021 --> 22:25.967
I rode shotgun on one of the lancers.

22:26.801 --> 22:30.055
And then I could see
the Invictus was about to jump,

22:30.138 --> 22:34.392
so I grabbed a sedation stick
and knocked myself out for the jump.

22:34.749 --> 22:37.043
Warned the rest of my people
to do the same.

22:40.273 --> 22:42.484
And I woke up to the dulcet tones
of your voice.

22:45.820 --> 22:48.156
But I don't understand
how you woke up so quickly.

22:48.181 --> 22:50.767
I never went to sleep.
It's like the Vault.

22:50.909 --> 22:53.870
I can't explain how or why,
but the jump just didn't affect me.

22:53.953 --> 22:55.705
So you got us back to Terminus?

22:55.789 --> 22:59.000
No, that was Lewis.
He died to get us back.

22:59.290 --> 23:01.125
And the Foundation's not responding?

23:02.670 --> 23:03.963
No one is,

23:05.548 --> 23:07.634
not even the Anacreons
Phara left behind.

23:10.845 --> 23:12.430
It's the null field.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.371
I can feel it, Hugo.

23:16.142 --> 23:21.231
It's… even bigger. It's… louder.

23:21.314 --> 23:23.566
It's like it's enveloped
the whole planet.

23:26.152 --> 23:27.404
I have to stop it.

23:27.987 --> 23:29.030
Are you crazy?

23:30.865 --> 23:32.617
What if they're all dead down there?

23:33.868 --> 23:36.228
What if we just left? Right now.

23:36.746 --> 23:38.081
We'll make a run for the Red Corridor.

23:38.164 --> 23:39.999
I'll show you Irina Four,
I'll show you Hesperus...

23:40.083 --> 23:41.418
I can't, Hugo.

23:41.501 --> 23:43.753
What if there is no solution
to this crisis?

23:45.088 --> 23:46.423
What if Seldon got it wrong?

23:58.268 --> 24:01.104
I have to see this through, Hugo.

24:05.066 --> 24:06.401
I have to fix this.

24:13.867 --> 24:15.201
What do you want me to do?

24:18.705 --> 24:20.916
The Invictus is gonna jump again

24:20.940 --> 24:23.001
unless your people
can disable its drives.

24:23.084 --> 24:25.545
Then let it jump. Let it take Phara.
It'll be out of our lives forever.

24:25.628 --> 24:26.629
No.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.007
The Foundation needs that ship.

24:31.384 --> 24:32.886
It's the way we end the crisis.

24:34.554 --> 24:36.931
- I can't tell you how…
- I just have a feeling.

24:43.480 --> 24:47.150
You said you have absolute faith in me.

24:50.361 --> 24:51.404
You still believe that?

24:55.825 --> 24:58.745
Be kind of a dick
if I changed my mind now, wouldn't I?

25:12.842 --> 25:14.288
I'll see you on the other side.

25:25.021 --> 25:26.272
I love you.

25:27.315 --> 25:28.441
Me too.

25:51.381 --> 25:53.094
You've lived every moment of your life

25:53.118 --> 25:54.509
with people watching you.

25:55.719 --> 25:57.679
The Scar's different.

25:58.346 --> 25:59.889
You can lose yourself in it.

26:01.766 --> 26:04.144
For Empire,
the Scar represents a failure.

26:04.728 --> 26:07.814
For the rest of Trantor,
it represents an opportunity.

26:09.107 --> 26:10.692
For the first time in centuries,

26:10.775 --> 26:15.029
we can look up and see
real clouds, real stars,

26:16.197 --> 26:19.534
not a simulation run by servers
designed to keep us complacent.

26:32.047 --> 26:36.092
I live on level 33,
in the Desnian Sector.

26:39.471 --> 26:41.973
Old Tertia makes the best
spiced malkas on the planet.

26:48.229 --> 26:50.023
This is the corridor I take home.

26:53.818 --> 26:55.653
It's nothing like your palace.

26:57.280 --> 26:58.990
It's chaotic. It's crowded.

27:06.831 --> 27:08.333
But it's alive.

27:12.045 --> 27:13.338
And it's waiting for you.

27:35.235 --> 27:36.472
I couldn't wait.

28:01.803 --> 28:03.304
You're not wearing your aura.

28:05.056 --> 28:09.686
I traded it for this,
so I wouldn't be recognized.

28:12.105 --> 28:13.398
The jacket's smart.

28:15.275 --> 28:16.317
Now we can burn it.

28:29.873 --> 28:34.085
We need to get my nanobots removed
in case they're tracking me. I…

28:35.295 --> 28:37.547
I-I probably shouldn't even stay here.

28:38.351 --> 28:40.869
It's okay. I got the signal damper.

28:41.551 --> 28:43.553
That'll cover you until
we can arrange to…

28:48.183 --> 28:49.184
Hey.

28:51.561 --> 28:53.021
The hardest part's over.

28:58.985 --> 29:00.403
You got away from them.

29:02.781 --> 29:03.782
You're here.

29:10.914 --> 29:12.985
But, truthfully…

29:13.875 --> 29:15.377
You still smell terrible.

29:19.422 --> 29:20.924
Why don't you shower?

29:49.953 --> 29:52.580
Hey, I was thinking
about a new name for me.

29:59.129 --> 30:00.130
Azura?

30:11.808 --> 30:13.086
What is that for?

31:18.875 --> 31:20.543
According to Salvor,
the engine room is that way.

31:24.355 --> 31:27.984
We've got about thirty-three hours
to disable the jumpdrives.

31:29.552 --> 31:32.639
What happened here?

31:33.890 --> 31:37.894
A long and terrible story
that no one's alive to tell…

31:38.520 --> 31:40.132
Anacreons, where?

31:40.522 --> 31:44.401
The bridge.
Salvor has them tied up in there.

31:45.443 --> 31:46.638
All clear.

32:01.042 --> 32:02.877
A wise man once said,

32:02.961 --> 32:06.450
"A people without history
is like a tree without roots."

32:09.926 --> 32:12.512
What's missing
from the wise man's history?

32:12.537 --> 32:14.666
When did story replace record?

32:19.102 --> 32:22.063
When all the facts
fall short of believability,

32:22.731 --> 32:25.525
fantasy feels reassuringly solid.

32:26.776 --> 32:28.945
And since this is my history,

32:29.524 --> 32:32.351
I get to decide
which parts have been subtracted,

32:33.533 --> 32:34.868
which have been added.

34:00.995 --> 34:02.232
Jord?

35:09.773 --> 35:12.442
Mom? Mom?

35:14.277 --> 35:17.113
Mom. Mom, wake up, it's me.

35:19.449 --> 35:21.493
Mom. Mom, wake up, it's me.

35:39.677 --> 35:41.414
Can you make anything of it?

36:08.915 --> 36:11.945
Fine. I'll figure it out myself.

36:35.692 --> 36:37.527
Open your fists, Salvor.

36:39.821 --> 36:41.197
Open your fists, Salvor.

36:41.865 --> 36:42.866
Come on.

37:00.592 --> 37:02.120
Can you make anything of it?

37:02.427 --> 37:05.055
Salvor, if you were part of the Plan,

37:05.138 --> 37:07.917
it would make it a lot easier
for me to believe in all this.

37:22.906 --> 37:24.824
How long did it take you…

37:25.742 --> 37:27.327
To trigger the Prime Radiant?

37:27.869 --> 37:29.356
Got it on the second try.

37:45.387 --> 37:47.712
History is the ultimate weapon,

37:47.736 --> 37:49.974
because it harnesses time itself.

37:50.767 --> 37:54.729
Used correctly,
the past can alter the present.

37:56.147 --> 37:58.051
What other invention can do that?

38:51.870 --> 38:53.163
Salvor?

38:53.246 --> 38:54.247
Mom?

39:01.796 --> 39:05.008
- I thought I'd never see you again.
- Me too.

39:14.267 --> 39:17.464
The null field, it's stopped.

39:26.988 --> 39:28.433
Did you do this?

39:37.832 --> 39:39.000
Is that a door?

39:43.004 --> 39:44.464
I think so.

39:44.547 --> 39:45.965
So, what now?

39:48.510 --> 39:50.121
Now is where it ends.

40:00.730 --> 40:02.399
Did you find the Huntress?

40:02.816 --> 40:04.150
We searched the entire ship.

40:04.526 --> 40:05.735
No sign of her.

40:06.778 --> 40:08.613
Except this.

40:10.115 --> 40:12.769
Then we get down to Terminus
as fast as possible.

40:13.618 --> 40:16.894
Obsidian, open a channel
to Arkose and Gneiss.

40:16.962 --> 40:19.359
Communications channel open.

40:19.791 --> 40:21.778
This is Thespin Command.

40:22.419 --> 40:26.297
I want all lancers planet-side
immediately.

40:27.590 --> 40:29.843
Which one of you is this ship slave to?

40:36.057 --> 40:39.936
Slave this ship to Phara Keaen,
or you die too.

40:40.019 --> 40:45.218
Arkose, invoke protocol.
Ship transfer, Phara Keaen.

40:57.078 --> 40:58.580
Heart rate's rising.

41:02.125 --> 41:05.670
If it gets to 120,
then the bots go into crisis mode.

41:07.338 --> 41:09.007
I'll increase the inhibitors.

41:10.091 --> 41:11.176
Pulse is stabilizing.

41:16.139 --> 41:18.167
Start the transfer now.

41:54.969 --> 41:57.389
We're transferring
your nanobots into my blood.

41:58.431 --> 42:00.392
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

42:01.559 --> 42:03.061
To have them removed?

42:03.144 --> 42:04.270
Who are you?

42:04.354 --> 42:07.399
A Dawn clone, obviously.

42:07.708 --> 42:09.710
Superficially identical to you.

42:11.403 --> 42:13.196
But how are you…

42:13.499 --> 42:17.045
Here?
Instead of floating in an aquarium?

42:18.952 --> 42:22.372
Our people managed to smuggle
some of Cleon I's DNA out of the palace.

42:23.289 --> 42:25.208
We've been working
towards this day for decades.

42:25.291 --> 42:28.837
You surprised us. We'd planned
to have you escape tomorrow.

42:29.921 --> 42:31.214
Where's Azura?

42:43.101 --> 42:44.436
This was all a trap.

42:46.312 --> 42:48.007
How could you do this to me?

42:49.065 --> 42:50.066
You?

42:51.192 --> 42:52.971
This is about the rest of the galaxy,

42:53.403 --> 42:56.531
all the planets and people who've
been crushed under the Empire's heel.

42:56.614 --> 42:57.741
It's not his fault.

42:59.200 --> 43:00.577
It's how he was raised.

43:02.162 --> 43:04.414
He and his brothers
have always been told

43:04.497 --> 43:08.528
they are the light that never dims,
an unbroken chain.

43:09.878 --> 43:13.700
Reality just doesn't penetrate
their little terrarium.

43:14.466 --> 43:16.634
I don't know how
you're gonna stomach it.

43:16.718 --> 43:17.996
I'll be fine.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.722
I've been practicing
my role long enough,

43:21.806 --> 43:24.476
the cloistered little tyrant
in the making…

43:27.520 --> 43:32.692
Projecting that subtle air
of self-pitying, arrogant indifference.

43:35.695 --> 43:39.699
Practicing? What are you talking about?

43:40.241 --> 43:43.161
"Practicing?
What are you talking about?"

43:44.829 --> 43:46.664
I'm your understudy, Dawn.

43:46.748 --> 43:49.250
And now it's time
for me to take center stage.

43:49.834 --> 43:51.795
I'm going to go back to the palace,

43:53.129 --> 43:54.631
and I'm gonna be you.

43:55.256 --> 43:59.052
Wh... They'll just kill you then.
They... They know I'm different.

43:59.135 --> 44:00.970
Right, but…

44:02.389 --> 44:03.515
I'm not.

44:04.265 --> 44:07.894
I'm not color-blind.
I'm not left-handed.

44:08.645 --> 44:11.773
I'm genetically identical to Cleon I.

44:13.942 --> 44:15.223
And I can prove it.

44:15.281 --> 44:17.862
I-I don't understand. Ho...

44:18.405 --> 44:20.740
How can you be identical to the first,
and I'm not?

44:21.491 --> 44:24.869
"Magnetic nanoparticle transfection"
is the technical term.

44:25.453 --> 44:27.288
It's all a little over my head,

44:27.372 --> 44:30.041
but, basically, they altered your DNA
after the fact.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.527
Like I said,

44:31.551 --> 44:34.212
this has been planned since
before you or I took our first breath.

44:34.713 --> 44:37.340
Our people knew they had to get you
out of the palace,

44:38.508 --> 44:40.093
but they couldn't just take you.

44:40.802 --> 44:42.303
That would've been too risky.

44:42.929 --> 44:45.807
They had to make it
so you'd choose to leave.

44:47.100 --> 44:51.229
You needed a motive to run.
And what better motive than survival?

44:54.065 --> 44:57.902
We're the ones
who made you different, Empire.

45:00.029 --> 45:02.115
In a certain way, you're lucky too.

45:02.198 --> 45:05.452
The Genetic Dynasty's
an affront to humanity,

45:05.535 --> 45:07.579
and you're no longer part of it.

45:08.621 --> 45:09.748
You never really were.

45:11.541 --> 45:13.293
The transfer's complete.

45:40.487 --> 45:42.322
You had no choice in any of this…

45:44.032 --> 45:45.977
But thank you just the same.

45:56.082 --> 45:57.613
Get him up.

46:01.758 --> 46:03.426
What are you gonna do to me?

46:03.657 --> 46:05.037
What do you think, Cleon?

46:30.161 --> 46:31.663
Azura. Azura, this way.

46:51.933 --> 46:53.085
Empire.

46:55.311 --> 46:57.924
Brother Dusk! I am so grateful.

47:01.609 --> 47:03.987
I want a full memory audit
of all the dead.

47:04.070 --> 47:05.389
And the girl?

47:06.322 --> 47:08.783
The girl. Yes.

47:13.121 --> 47:14.956
Quite a performance.

47:15.874 --> 47:18.626
It was a pleasure to observe it,

47:19.919 --> 47:23.908
tailored though it was
to the young and foolish.

47:33.558 --> 47:35.769
You didn't really think
we'd let this drone leave the palace

47:35.852 --> 47:37.771
without alerting us, did you?

47:37.854 --> 47:42.817
We followed your whole
enticing travelogue home, my dear.

47:51.034 --> 47:53.161
You let him get away
so he would lead you to us.

47:53.995 --> 47:54.996
Shroud her.

48:16.059 --> 48:17.602
You got what you wanted then.

48:18.895 --> 48:21.564
Never presume to understand what I want.

48:27.278 --> 48:31.116
You are stupid, naive, gullible.

48:31.866 --> 48:33.159
So was I at your age.

48:33.785 --> 48:35.453
And these things are forgivable.

48:35.537 --> 48:39.457
But the matter of your… difference,

48:41.000 --> 48:42.460
that's rather more complicated.

48:42.544 --> 48:44.504
But you must've heard them.

48:45.547 --> 48:48.216
I'm a victim. We all are.

48:48.299 --> 48:49.676
Yes.

48:49.759 --> 48:54.139
And that makes you
the embodiment of our vulnerability,

48:54.222 --> 48:56.850
an ugly reminder of the knife-edge

48:56.933 --> 49:00.478
upon which
our Genetic Dynasty is balanced.

49:01.229 --> 49:06.609
By what logic would we want
to look on your face ever again?

49:08.069 --> 49:09.112
My face?

49:11.948 --> 49:13.491
My face is your face.

49:14.534 --> 49:18.496
Forget logic. Try empathy.

49:27.338 --> 49:29.132
Wait, wait, wait.

49:29.215 --> 49:32.578
Surely it's not up to you.
It's up to Day.

49:33.720 --> 49:34.721
True.

49:35.346 --> 49:36.973
Brother Day will be home soon.

49:37.766 --> 49:39.309
You can plead your case to him.

49:40.560 --> 49:44.731
I doubt his experience on the Maiden
has made him serene.

49:54.908 --> 49:57.327
Warden, you made it back!

49:57.410 --> 49:58.995
Keep your distance, you two.

49:59.079 --> 50:01.247
But everyone's waking up. It's over.

50:01.331 --> 50:02.832
It's not over.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.417
Salvor, wait. Don't go in there.

50:04.501 --> 50:06.086
I have to, Mom.

50:07.629 --> 50:09.422
You will not! Step away.

50:10.048 --> 50:13.259
You said this wasn't a trick,
that you didn't know what this was.

50:13.343 --> 50:14.631
We don't.

50:14.721 --> 50:17.680
And yet your daughter has tamed it.
How do you explain that?

51:22.203 --> 51:24.330
Sorry, Sal.
I tried to talk 'em out of landing.

51:24.998 --> 51:26.833
No, this makes sense.

51:26.916 --> 51:28.949
This is where I'm supposed to be.

51:28.973 --> 51:31.337
Everything converging
in a single crisis.

51:31.421 --> 51:33.741
Where is our Huntress?

51:35.592 --> 51:37.661
She lost control of the Invictus.

51:38.261 --> 51:42.583
Your plans for martyrdom, for Trantor,
they're done.

51:43.099 --> 51:44.309
Rowan?

51:45.185 --> 51:47.520
The Weald Gods have forsaken us.

52:17.217 --> 52:18.843
Oh, hammered shit.

52:33.400 --> 52:37.237
Well, isn't this a pretty picture?

52:37.821 --> 52:42.268
Enemies old and new,
conveniently gathered in one place.

52:46.246 --> 52:49.441
Drop your weapons and unbind him.

52:56.965 --> 53:01.636
And you, Warden, don't even think
about flashing that coin of yours.

53:02.303 --> 53:05.958
I'm glad you're alive, Phara, truly.

53:07.642 --> 53:08.643
I need you to hear this.

53:08.727 --> 53:12.147
Last thing I'm interested in hearing
is more words from you.

53:12.230 --> 53:13.445
Phara, please.

53:13.469 --> 53:15.692
The jump induces psychosis.
You're not thinking straight.

53:15.775 --> 53:17.595
I'm thinking just fine.

53:25.076 --> 53:26.244
Also aiming.

53:26.327 --> 53:28.830
Look, if you don't like
what I have to say,

53:29.539 --> 53:33.293
you can kill me when I'm done.
You can kill all of us.

53:33.376 --> 53:34.878
I will.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.256
That ship…

53:40.133 --> 53:44.512
Is the most powerful weapon your
people will ever get their hands on.

53:45.346 --> 53:47.766
If that's the case, why destroy it?

53:49.684 --> 53:52.270
- Why not use it for leverage?
- How?

53:52.353 --> 53:55.523
We band together, all three worlds.

53:55.607 --> 53:56.983
Stop moving!

53:59.903 --> 54:01.654
We can share the Invictus.

54:02.044 --> 54:05.839
We can repair it, together.

54:06.868 --> 54:10.914
All we have to do is let our logic speak
louder than our emotions.

54:16.544 --> 54:17.545
Phara, stop.

54:19.877 --> 54:24.674
You would take up arms
against your own Huntress?

54:24.844 --> 54:26.805
The hunt is over, Phara.

54:40.402 --> 54:41.945
Phara, stop!

55:13.810 --> 55:15.963
- Take aim!
- Freestone, wait!

55:19.691 --> 55:22.678
She's gone. Drop it.

55:43.339 --> 55:44.841
Well, this is encouraging.

55:45.352 --> 55:48.605
Anacreons, Thespins, and Termini.

55:49.888 --> 55:52.640
Seeing you all gathered here
gives me hope…

55:55.729 --> 55:58.046
We might actually pull this off.
