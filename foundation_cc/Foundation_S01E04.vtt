01:36.185 --> 01:38.917
Once, a man came to Hari Seldon

01:38.941 --> 01:40.731
and asked to be told his fate.

01:48.656 --> 01:49.925
He wanted to know

01:49.949 --> 01:53.243
whether the predictive models could
chart the significance of his life.

01:58.040 --> 02:02.044
But Hari told him only the movements
of masses could be predicted.

02:05.089 --> 02:10.030
The fate of one individual
will always remain a mystery.

02:53.887 --> 02:56.223
The clockwork of civilization…

02:59.059 --> 03:01.562
The rise and fall of cultures…

03:04.064 --> 03:06.233
Causes and worlds…

03:09.194 --> 03:12.948
These were answers
Hari Seldon had long since unriddled.

03:15.284 --> 03:18.704
Belief is a powerful weapon.

03:20.456 --> 03:24.980
That's why the Empire feared
Hari Seldon's predictions so much.

03:26.462 --> 03:32.468
Empires govern worldly concerns,
but what comes after? Our souls?

03:33.218 --> 03:35.488
These realms are the purview of faith.

03:35.512 --> 03:40.684
And faith is a sword
forged in the fires of the infinite.

04:25.896 --> 04:28.792
Empire? Do you seek different amusement?

04:28.816 --> 04:33.380
You'll do. For the routine pleasures
in the routine manner.

04:33.404 --> 04:35.990
Which pleasures do you prefer, Empire?

04:36.949 --> 04:41.161
Do you offer the pleasure of nothing?
Is that on the menu?

04:41.912 --> 04:44.915
Is it true?
No one's allowed to touch you?

04:47.835 --> 04:49.271
Bold, aren't you?

04:49.295 --> 04:52.173
I have only 24 hours of service to you.

04:52.609 --> 04:54.277
I want to make the most of it.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.178
Then try to touch me.

05:02.140 --> 05:03.850
I said try.

05:31.670 --> 05:33.464
The aura repels kinetic energy.

05:35.549 --> 05:39.845
I want you to try it again,
with a softer touch.

05:41.639 --> 05:42.640
Slower.

05:47.186 --> 05:48.187
Slower.

06:05.412 --> 06:07.265
So, how…

06:07.289 --> 06:08.391
…does the rest work?

06:23.806 --> 06:25.283
What?

06:25.307 --> 06:26.934
You are required, Empire.

06:28.352 --> 06:31.915
I understand Empire has
a physiological need for intimacy.

06:31.939 --> 06:34.836
But the current matter
supersedes this need.

06:48.857 --> 06:50.233
Ambassador Thanwall.

06:50.916 --> 06:54.020
Most esteemed Empire,
glory to the light...

06:54.044 --> 06:55.857
Out with it, Ambassador.

06:57.006 --> 07:00.068
Proxima Opal has passed, Empire.

07:00.092 --> 07:01.278
Our condolences.

07:01.302 --> 07:03.405
Condolences. Heartfelt.

07:03.429 --> 07:05.365
Thank you, Empire.

07:05.389 --> 07:08.952
Proxima Opal will be missed
and mourned by her flock.

07:08.976 --> 07:13.248
And now the conclave will elevate
her successor, Zephyr Gilat.

07:13.272 --> 07:15.585
A capable candidate. We like her.

07:15.899 --> 07:18.461
Carry our condolences forward,
Ambassador.

07:18.485 --> 07:22.549
And inform Gilat
she's always welcome on Trantor.

07:22.573 --> 07:26.511
On the topic of a successor, Empire,

07:26.535 --> 07:29.891
there is some debate.

07:30.414 --> 07:34.062
Another candidate has been
gaining support.

07:35.169 --> 07:36.606
Zephyr Halima.

07:37.212 --> 07:41.443
Halima Ifa does not adhere to
accepted doctrine,

07:41.467 --> 07:44.154
as have our previous proximas.

07:44.491 --> 07:48.245
She is advocating for
a return to the Primary Octavo.

07:49.350 --> 07:50.954
Is she suicidal?

07:51.560 --> 07:53.830
Who is this woman to
question our primacy?

07:53.854 --> 07:55.790
A-A-Apologies, Empire. I-I...

07:55.814 --> 07:58.378
- Did you know about this?
- Only moments ago.

07:58.734 --> 08:00.378
When is Opal's funeral?

08:00.402 --> 08:02.112
Two days hence, Empire.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.427
Say nothing of this conversation.

08:17.451 --> 08:18.837
We will contact you shortly.

08:27.304 --> 08:29.866
I helped install the previous Proxima.

08:29.890 --> 08:32.452
I'll leave for the conclave
as soon as possible.

08:32.476 --> 08:35.371
Is that really necessary?
Can't you just holo-cast yourself in?

08:35.395 --> 08:36.456
Not this time.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.297
Luminism claims
three trillion followers.

08:39.321 --> 08:42.278
This schism requires a personal touch.

08:50.494 --> 08:52.724
What's the Primary Octavo?

08:53.618 --> 08:56.955
A heretical scripture. Pre-imperial.

08:57.943 --> 09:01.232
It directly links the soul
to individuated sentience.

09:01.589 --> 09:05.068
- What does that mean...
- Individuated sentience.

09:05.092 --> 09:06.861
Think, Brother Dawn.

09:06.885 --> 09:09.573
If a soul cleaves only to
an individual being,

09:09.597 --> 09:12.891
that calls into question
that which cannot be individuated.

09:15.308 --> 09:20.417
All Cleons are
perfect genetic copies of the first.

09:20.441 --> 09:21.711
And therefore…

09:22.516 --> 09:24.184
We don't have souls.

09:24.903 --> 09:28.259
So, this Halima woman is saying
we're, what?

09:29.533 --> 09:30.719
Not human?

09:30.887 --> 09:32.387
Indirectly. But...

09:32.411 --> 09:34.472
And if the galaxy comes to believe

09:34.496 --> 09:37.767
their leaders are less than,
rather than more than themselves,

09:37.791 --> 09:39.729
they may cease to follow.

09:44.632 --> 09:46.277
We are a glass vessel…

09:47.760 --> 09:50.156
Spun with a fine hand.

09:52.556 --> 09:57.205
If the pressures inside start to swirl
and we are not uniform…

10:00.260 --> 10:01.626
We may burst.

10:07.488 --> 10:09.801
- Who are you?
- Salvor Hardin.

10:10.991 --> 10:12.387
Warden of Terminus.

10:17.206 --> 10:19.978
Anacreons aren't
allowed on imperial soil.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.892
What are you doing here?

10:24.916 --> 10:26.352
Scrapping.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.895
That's a lot of armor for scrappers.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.980
We're looking for
the ship's navigation module.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.942
Any critical components were stripped
from this hulk decades ago.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.778
But, again,
a real scrapper would know that.

10:35.802 --> 10:39.490
You should leave.
Before the Empire catches wind of this.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.492
My people do not fear the Empire.

10:47.751 --> 10:49.125
Look, I caught you by surprise

10:49.149 --> 10:50.525
and now you're improvising.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.339
But if you were gonna kill me,
you would have already.

10:55.569 --> 10:56.862
So what's the play?

11:02.704 --> 11:05.266
That tower. Take us there.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.392
Why?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.355
Let me be clear, Warden.

11:11.379 --> 11:14.132
We know how to use
every resource we come across.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.445
The children we observed earlier,

11:17.469 --> 11:20.114
we've seen how they sneak away
just before dawn,

11:20.138 --> 11:22.700
straying far away from
the rest of your flock.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.201
If you won't lead us to the tower,

11:25.502 --> 11:27.204
we'll simply utilize one of them.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.498
It's not that simple. We have a fence.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.875
We're aware of your fence.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.960
We saw you
perform maintenance on it earlier.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.571
Which makes you the perfect
person to take us through it.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.598
To the tower then!

11:53.200 --> 11:55.202
The fence uses DNA recognition.

11:57.068 --> 11:59.237
It'll radiate anyone
who isn't in the database.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.660
I might be able to get one of you in.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.037
If we walk through together,

12:08.061 --> 12:10.456
the fence should write off
the second person as an error.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.707
Then take us all through it.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.425
This only works once. Maybe.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.657
The only thing I've ever dragged
through this fence was already dead.

12:29.249 --> 12:33.145
I can feel you tensing up. Don't.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.289
If she isn't back within a watch,

12:35.432 --> 12:37.709
we'll raze your city to the ground.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.626
Go. Get the others.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.444
Establish a perimeter
and stay out of sight.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.622
Wanna drive and I'll hold the gun?

13:20.675 --> 13:22.118
Tell me your name, at least.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.220
Are we best friends now?

13:24.721 --> 13:26.323
You've risked a lot coming here.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.683
We've risked everything, Warden.

13:35.774 --> 13:39.694
- No. There was a boy in our path!
- Don't get cute. I have eyes.

13:49.871 --> 13:50.931
The tower's that way.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.191
I'm taking a shortcut.
Fewer watchmen this way.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.172
What is that?

14:04.135 --> 14:05.196
Stop.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.434
Stop.

14:17.607 --> 14:21.128
The stories about Salvor Hardin?
They usually begin here.

14:22.178 --> 14:24.507
The warden and the ghost,

14:24.531 --> 14:26.717
inexplicably bound together.

14:26.741 --> 14:27.742
Thanks.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.521
How did they slip past our radar?

14:38.545 --> 14:41.524
Flew in the nap of the earth. Maybe.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.817
Any sign of their ships?

14:42.841 --> 14:44.482
Ugh. They claimed to be scrappers.

14:44.506 --> 14:46.396
Said they were after
a navigation module.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.447
- Obviously bullshit.
- We need to contact the Empire.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.770
We can't do anything
without authorization.

14:49.794 --> 14:51.992
Come on, Mom.
We're an imperial outpost in name only.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.329
When was the last time they even
contacted us? A decade ago?

14:55.353 --> 14:57.540
They won't defend us.
We need to do it ourselves.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.084
Easy. Violence is the last refuge...

15:00.108 --> 15:02.753
Of the incompetent, I know.
That's an old man's doctrine.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.516
It's an observation I made
when I was younger than you.

15:04.554 --> 15:08.134
Would Hari's plan have assumed
we'd wait for help or act on our own?

15:08.158 --> 15:11.303
Hari is not here, Mom.
We need to help ourselves.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.250
Welcome back, best friend.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.905
You left the conversation
just as we were

15:19.929 --> 15:21.522
really getting to know each other.

15:21.546 --> 15:22.966
Headache?

15:23.001 --> 15:24.692
Teeth feel like they're falling out?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.237
What was that cursed thing?

15:26.261 --> 15:28.571
It was here when we colonized Terminus.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.320
Didn't show up on any of our scans.

15:30.344 --> 15:32.241
I guess it didn't show
up on yours either.

15:32.457 --> 15:34.285
Why did it not affect you?

15:34.309 --> 15:36.378
Let's just say I'm the last person
on Terminus

15:36.402 --> 15:37.955
you wanted to come across.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.856
So…

15:41.149 --> 15:42.692
What now, Warden?

15:44.861 --> 15:46.630
She had a small army with her.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.924
An... And their tracks,
some of them were deep.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.410
Shorter stride lengths. As if they
were carrying heavy equipment.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.871
Like they're planning on digging in,
Dad.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.624
- Well, what do you wanna do?
- I don't know.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.186
I've been following my instincts, and...

16:00.210 --> 16:01.896
I don't know,
maybe it was just dumb luck.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.356
Your instincts didn't just
lead you to the ships.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.549
They led you to her.
And you stopped her.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.403
If you were better at math,

16:09.427 --> 16:12.931
you'd know that repeated luck was
more than just luck, Salvor.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.826
Whether your mother wants
to admit it or not,

16:15.850 --> 16:17.690
we have been following your lead

16:17.714 --> 16:19.854
from
the moment you pulled yourself upright.

16:20.772 --> 16:24.634
It's no accident
the people made you warden.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.153
So lead us.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.686
I have never had the pleasure, Empire.
How may I be of service?

16:42.710 --> 16:44.021
Captain Obrecht, is it?

16:44.045 --> 16:47.525
Shadowmaster, Empire.
Shadowmaster Obrecht.

16:47.549 --> 16:48.800
A fine likeness.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.615
What's the protocol for dealing
with a problem palace attendant?

16:54.639 --> 16:56.766
What level of attendant, if I may ask?

16:57.517 --> 16:58.738
Someone who works in the garden.

16:58.762 --> 17:00.913
May I ask the nature of the problem?

17:00.937 --> 17:03.631
You may not. I just want her name.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.995
I can ascertain that, Empire.

17:06.019 --> 17:07.920
Along with anything
else you may require.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.303
That's all for now.

17:18.455 --> 17:21.517
I saw at least a dozen Anacreons
outside the fence.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.519
Travik, take the southern loop.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.270
Kalin, cover the west.

17:25.294 --> 17:29.108
Yate, I want you on the east so you can
spot anyone coming over that ridge.

17:29.132 --> 17:32.945
And if we see any of these guys,
what are we supposed to do?

17:32.969 --> 17:34.029
Nothing.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.622
Don't shoot at them,
don't speak to them.

17:35.646 --> 17:37.116
Just watch 'em and keep me informed.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.461
What's this about Anacreons on Terminus?

17:38.485 --> 17:39.827
Calls herself Phara.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.371
Beyond that,
nothing about her story adds up.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.790
If anyone can tell
whether somebody's lying, it's you.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.168
That's just the thing.
I can't tell if she's lying

17:47.192 --> 17:49.003
or if she's just not telling the truth.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.195
Is there a difference?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.930
I've got a plan.
But I'm gonna need your help.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.140
What's this? Torture?

18:01.164 --> 18:02.857
He's my manservant.

18:03.625 --> 18:07.063
Runs and fetches.
Reseals my boots when they need it.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.638
I'm thinking a watch has passed,

18:09.662 --> 18:12.485
as far as my weald-men are concerned.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.076
Why are you really here, Phara?

18:15.386 --> 18:17.388
Salvor has a talent for reading people.

18:18.389 --> 18:21.017
It's uncanny, really.
I was just telling her mother about it.

18:21.518 --> 18:22.787
She doesn't believe you.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.539
Well, you told her you're my boss.
Now my praise rings hollow.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.166
What's your interest
in the Foundation Tower?

18:27.190 --> 18:31.253
The module. I already told you.
You keep asking me the same questions.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.215
I'm giving you a chance
to give better answers.

18:34.239 --> 18:35.573
Crowns.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.263
I know you're after something else.

18:41.287 --> 18:45.601
We don't have any Anacreon artifacts,
no heavy weapons, so what...

18:45.625 --> 18:46.876
This is going in circles.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.445
Explain it to her.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.565
Just give her what she wants.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.675
Your accent's not terrible.

18:53.892 --> 18:56.744
You were taught by someone
in the port city, obviously.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.073
Those lazy vowels.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.515
I'm a trader.

19:00.921 --> 19:03.341
I do business with your people
now and then.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.537
Thought I smelled a whiff
of Thespin on you.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.708
I want the navigation module. That's it.

19:09.732 --> 19:10.900
Another lie.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.837
You speak Anacreon as well?

19:12.861 --> 19:14.004
Not a word.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.846
- Yet you know I'm lying?
- Cats.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.218
That was a 50-50 chance.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.893
Cats again. Who are you really?

19:24.247 --> 19:26.308
Twenty-five percent chance there.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.775
Now it's back to crowns.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.988
Twelve and a half percent.
And another crown. Why are you here?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.156
Another crown again.

19:46.936 --> 19:51.399
I'd give you the percentage,
but repeated luck is never luck.

19:56.654 --> 19:57.655
Who are you?

19:58.156 --> 20:00.676
We're scrappers. The module.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.804
You're not scrappers. And the navigation
module's a distraction...

20:03.828 --> 20:05.514
Enough of these child games.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.267
Take this Thespin thug off his leash
and let him get on with it!

20:08.291 --> 20:09.292
Your scars…

20:10.585 --> 20:11.694
Keloids.

20:16.508 --> 20:17.967
Your left eye…

20:19.552 --> 20:20.613
Nano-glass.

20:20.637 --> 20:23.491
You lose it when
the Empire bombed Anacreon?

20:23.515 --> 20:26.744
I imagine you must have been, what,
five, six at the time?

20:26.768 --> 20:29.030
Neutron bombs have a low explosive yield

20:29.054 --> 20:31.499
but a high amount of ionizing radiation.

20:31.523 --> 20:35.628
Now, I know about 50% of the population
died off within a week,

20:35.652 --> 20:38.721
another 20 or 30
within the remaining year.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.224
Odds are you came out the other end
an orphan, right?

20:43.618 --> 20:47.080
Probably lost a mom and dad.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.167
Boiled alive.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.837
Or maybe s-slower.

20:54.629 --> 20:55.630
Cancer.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.872
Thyroid for your mother.

21:00.201 --> 21:02.947
Her voice, it changed before she died.

21:02.971 --> 21:05.598
Who else did you lose? A sister?

21:10.861 --> 21:11.946
A brother.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.794
A little brother.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.522
There's a deadness inside her.
It's like a...

21:36.546 --> 21:39.841
It's like a well with no bottom,
just sucking everything in.

21:41.509 --> 21:42.719
She wants to die.

21:44.304 --> 21:48.016
She wants everyone to die. I felt it.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.041
What she said when she broke,
did you understand any of it?

21:56.065 --> 21:58.753
Some, yeah. It's archaic Anacreon,
not the common vernacular.

21:58.777 --> 22:02.346
Well, she slipped up.
Because I understood something too.

22:02.947 --> 22:06.726
A name I remember from the holos.
Larken Keaen.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.016
During the Anthor Belt dispute,

22:12.040 --> 22:14.351
Anacreon and Thespis brought gifts
to the Emperor.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.936
My people's was the Book of Ablut...

22:15.960 --> 22:18.404
And Anacreon's was a bow
carved for its greatest hunter.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.608
- Larken Keaen.
- Meaning?

22:20.632 --> 22:22.616
Phara's not just some junker.

22:23.218 --> 22:25.095
She's the Grand Huntress of Anacreon.

22:35.271 --> 22:38.525
All this unrest,
who's responsible for it?

22:39.234 --> 22:41.861
Sinkers. A nom de guerre.

22:42.362 --> 22:45.188
After the heat sink
meltdown on level 77.

22:45.212 --> 22:47.968
It was caused when the Star Bridge fell.

22:47.992 --> 22:51.871
And 35 years later we're still grappling
with the aftereffects.

22:54.332 --> 22:59.504
The businesses of Empire is
a cascade of competing priorities.

23:00.130 --> 23:03.341
Brother Day will need your support
while I tend to the conclave.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.569
It's overwhelming.

23:05.593 --> 23:06.803
For one man.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.491
Fortunately, there are three of us.

23:10.515 --> 23:14.210
Bad tidings also come in threes.
Have you heard the news, Brother?

23:14.936 --> 23:17.718
A communications buoy
in the Arcturus Sector

23:17.742 --> 23:18.916
has come off-line.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.961
They must go off-line
all the time, right?

23:21.985 --> 23:24.338
We probably have thousands of them
across the galaxy.

23:24.362 --> 23:25.673
Tens of thousands.

23:25.697 --> 23:28.950
But only one that handles communications
in the Outer Reach.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.537
I see that you fail to grasp
the significance.

23:33.385 --> 23:34.803
It's Terminus.

23:36.166 --> 23:39.711
It's where Brother Dusk exiled
Hari Seldon's followers.

23:43.423 --> 23:48.285
The Reach. The conclave. Insurgency…

23:49.971 --> 23:52.140
Do you see a pattern forming here?

23:53.141 --> 23:54.142
Show them.

23:56.019 --> 23:57.550
Sensing vulnerability,

23:57.574 --> 24:00.273
soon other players will begin
to apply downward pressure.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.671
An exhortation from one of the galaxy's
major religions is a given.

24:05.695 --> 24:08.764
Or perhaps a homegrown insurrection
here on Trantor.

24:09.199 --> 24:14.847
If the fall can be accelerated,
can it not also be slowed?

24:14.871 --> 24:16.056
Now look at you, Brother.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.560
So smugly self-assured
atop the middle throne.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.979
I used to practice that smile
in the mirror.

24:22.003 --> 24:24.148
Enough. I know how the scene ends.

24:24.172 --> 24:26.025
But have you embraced its lessons?

24:26.049 --> 24:29.111
Luminism.
The Sinker insurrection happening now.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.679
Seldon all but drew you a to-do list.

24:32.931 --> 24:33.991
And you ignored him.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.701
Because he was a charlatan.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.477
You offer nothing new.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.939
Just a younger grape…

24:41.523 --> 24:42.673
From the same vine,

24:43.149 --> 24:46.045
destined for the same old bottle.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.214
You can't save yourselves…

24:48.405 --> 24:50.556
But you can save your legacy.

24:51.866 --> 24:53.910
Hari Seldon is long dead.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.431
Murdered by his protégé, no less.

24:57.455 --> 25:00.083
The man was murdered.
But what about the movement, Brother?

25:02.335 --> 25:04.546
Martyrs tend to have a long half-life.

25:13.221 --> 25:15.400
Thanks to you, we are now staring down
the barrel

25:15.424 --> 25:17.201
of a genuine diplomatic crisis.

25:17.225 --> 25:19.245
What was I supposed to do, Lewis?

25:19.269 --> 25:21.122
Let Phara kill me
and then move on to the kids?

25:21.146 --> 25:22.832
You shouldn't have questioned her
without me.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.583
Be glad I did. We know who she is now.

25:24.607 --> 25:26.489
We have leverage.
We can bargain with her people.

25:26.522 --> 25:28.546
If this choice
inflames the city into violence,

25:28.570 --> 25:30.506
you have achieved
elaborate suicide for us all.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.967
Didn't Hari say the Foundation
survives the first crisis?

25:32.991 --> 25:35.272
Yes, he did.
But, as I've told you before,

25:35.296 --> 25:36.846
you are an outlier.

25:36.870 --> 25:38.055
- Meaning?
- Salvor.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.723
Meaning that you weren't accounted for.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.267
You have a connection with the Vault

25:41.291 --> 25:43.602
which couldn't have possibly
have been predicted.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.146
You are not baked into the model.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.689
You're saying I'm
not part of God's plan.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.024
I am saying psychohistory
can't account for individuals.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.609
So you're saying
I've destroyed God's plan?

25:50.633 --> 25:53.028
- It's time to take a step back, Salvor.
- Step back?

25:53.052 --> 25:55.072
I thought the whole damn point
of the Foundation

25:55.096 --> 25:57.533
was preparing for the unthinkable.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.702
When I asked for more defensive weapons,

25:59.726 --> 26:02.329
you said the likelihood of an attack
seemed remote.

26:02.353 --> 26:04.672
When I wanted to run more drills,
nothing.

26:04.981 --> 26:06.834
So here we are now, not prepared.

26:06.858 --> 26:08.709
I might be an outlier,

26:08.733 --> 26:11.428
but I'm not
the one screwing up the Plan, Lewis.

26:18.286 --> 26:20.389
Lewis Pirenne, director.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.965
Now, why would the Anacreon Council

26:21.989 --> 26:24.393
send its highest-ranking
military officer

26:24.417 --> 26:26.270
to an imperial outpost?

26:26.294 --> 26:28.939
Is that what you're pretending
your little doomsday cult is?

26:28.963 --> 26:30.858
Because I don't see the Empire anywhere.

26:30.882 --> 26:34.388
All I see are academics, laborers
and very few guns.

26:34.424 --> 26:35.905
You took down the comms buoy.

26:35.929 --> 26:39.533
Of course. We wanted to operate
in private, away from prying eyes.

26:39.557 --> 26:40.862
You have to know the Empire

26:40.886 --> 26:42.644
will send
someone to investigate eventually.

26:43.478 --> 26:44.830
Or is that the point?

26:44.854 --> 26:46.749
Your women are so much sharper
than your men.

26:47.899 --> 26:51.670
The barbarian kingdoms are exiled.
You have no business here.

26:53.321 --> 26:54.572
"Barbarians."

26:55.573 --> 26:58.017
Just a convenient slur
for anyone not like you.

26:58.451 --> 27:02.098
Trantor left us all here to die.
Your people and mine.

27:02.122 --> 27:03.974
We're just dying at different speeds.

27:03.998 --> 27:05.393
The Foundation isn't dying.

27:05.417 --> 27:09.063
We are fulfilling the mission
Hari Seldon entrusted us with.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.453
Seldon also predicted that the fall
would begin

27:11.477 --> 27:12.906
at the edge of the galaxy.

27:13.883 --> 27:15.361
- Here.
- The same science

27:15.385 --> 27:17.446
that saved the Imperial Palace
when the Star Bridge fell

27:17.470 --> 27:18.739
protects Terminus City.

27:18.763 --> 27:20.241
You mean your energy barrier?

27:20.265 --> 27:21.325
Mmm.

27:21.349 --> 27:25.311
A weapon's only as good as
the man who's wielding it.

27:40.535 --> 27:41.846
Kalin, what's your situation?

27:41.870 --> 27:43.848
It's getting pretty crowded over here.

27:43.872 --> 27:46.183
- I think I need backup.
- Not happening.

27:46.207 --> 27:49.562
Salvor saw a dozen. You're telling me
we've got Anacreons all over?

27:49.586 --> 27:52.422
I'm telling you I'm seeing enough guns
to take out the whole town.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.924
Empire.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.555
The matter we discussed?

28:01.806 --> 28:05.393
Her name is Azura Odili.
A palace botanist since the age of 13.

28:05.977 --> 28:09.439
Her father, deceased, was also
an agroecologist in the gardens.

28:09.981 --> 28:13.193
Her mother founded
a school for the ikebana, now closed.

28:14.652 --> 28:16.112
You said there was a problem?

28:17.781 --> 28:21.075
How are problems generally solved
in this situation?

28:21.826 --> 28:23.776
Any manner that achieves its goal.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.331
My job is to eliminate problems, Empire.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.720
Azura Odili.

28:43.598 --> 28:45.659
Oh-dee-lee? Oh-dih-lee?

28:45.683 --> 28:46.827
Dee, Empire.

28:46.851 --> 28:48.770
You were outside my chambers earlier.

28:50.355 --> 28:53.042
- Want to know what you think you saw.
- I saw nothing, Empire.

28:53.066 --> 28:54.877
No. I believe you saw something.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.129
I only see what Empire wants me to see.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.513
I could have you removed
from your station,

29:00.490 --> 29:02.718
sent to scrub the
heat sinks on level 80.

29:02.742 --> 29:06.055
I could do worse to you. Much worse.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.348
You know all this.

29:07.372 --> 29:09.934
Empire, Brother Dusk
has asked me to summon you.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.292
Tell him I'm coming.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.754
Remove this entire bed.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.153
From my chambers
the smell of the blossoms

29:17.177 --> 29:18.192
is overbearing.

29:18.216 --> 29:21.451
- Empire, you needn't bother with this...
- It's settled. You can go.

29:25.348 --> 29:26.850
Wolvesbreath helps with the pain.

29:27.684 --> 29:29.495
The brownish-green leaves
with the red stripe.

29:29.519 --> 29:31.080
They reduce the swelling and bruising...

29:31.104 --> 29:33.565
I don't recall asking
for your medical advice.

29:35.442 --> 29:36.443
Which?

29:59.507 --> 30:00.633
The pointed leaves.

30:13.646 --> 30:14.647
What is it?

30:15.148 --> 30:16.775
Lupi spiritus.

30:17.358 --> 30:20.921
Wolvesbreath, Empire.
From our medicinal garden.

30:20.945 --> 30:23.799
It's an analgesic and vasodilator.

30:23.823 --> 30:24.967
Is it poisonous?

30:24.991 --> 30:29.305
No. Wolvesbreath is used in tea
as well as tinctures.

30:29.329 --> 30:32.683
It stimulates the blood vessels,
promotes healing...

30:32.707 --> 30:33.875
Eat it.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.649
If you're not dead
within the next few hours,

30:40.673 --> 30:42.860
have a kilogram of these
sent to my quarters.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.094
Of course, Empire.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.412
Laylo Fulham, get your ass back home
this instant!

30:53.436 --> 30:54.497
Are they gonna get through?

30:54.521 --> 30:55.605
Course not.

30:56.489 --> 30:58.699
Go back to your home, people. Please.

30:58.723 --> 31:02.010
It's not safe out here.
Back up. Back up.

31:03.488 --> 31:05.174
You need to come out here. Now.

31:05.198 --> 31:06.342
Kind of busy here, Yate.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.968
I know, and I'm still calling.

31:07.992 --> 31:11.222
We've got Anacreon's troops massing
from the east, west, south,

31:11.246 --> 31:12.997
and presumably the north.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.811
Remember how to hold a rifle, old man?

31:16.835 --> 31:18.110
Barrel goes forward?

31:18.628 --> 31:21.697
We've spotted Anacreons
at multiple locations outside the fence.

31:22.006 --> 31:23.949
- I'll go west.
- We'll head north.

31:24.259 --> 31:25.355
I shouldn't leave.

31:25.379 --> 31:26.695
Lewis is completely
overmatched in there.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.179
I'll babysit him, I promise.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.223
All right.

31:31.391 --> 31:34.245
Is it true? You got some kind of
Anacreon chieftain in there?

31:34.269 --> 31:35.579
You been drinking, Muller?

31:35.603 --> 31:38.833
It's the end of the galaxy, isn't it?
Hari's prediction's coming true.

31:38.857 --> 31:41.335
You got hold of a bad rumor, Muller.
Local poacher's all.

31:41.359 --> 31:42.944
They're already here, aren't they?

31:43.820 --> 31:46.281
Hey, why don't you just
take a break for a second.

32:00.920 --> 32:01.921
Hey!

32:02.630 --> 32:03.882
I won't hurt you.

32:07.569 --> 32:08.696
Just tell me who you are.

32:09.387 --> 32:10.555
Sal.

32:11.055 --> 32:12.116
Sal.

32:12.140 --> 32:14.702
Sal. Hey, hey. What's wrong?

32:14.726 --> 32:16.746
I was just in the Imperial Library
on Trantor.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.731
- What do you mean you were there?
- I mean I was there. In the stacks.

32:20.398 --> 32:22.585
The ceiling was wooden,
there were all these marble busts.

32:22.609 --> 32:24.194
And there was a boy with a knife.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.989
It was the same boy who
led me to the Anacreons.

32:29.324 --> 32:33.429
It's the Vault. I can feel it, Hugo.
It's trying to tell me something

32:33.453 --> 32:36.380
about the Anacreons and this crisis.
Everything.

32:36.404 --> 32:37.486
Okay, listen to me.

32:37.510 --> 32:40.650
I've always said you should
let this planet shrug you off.

32:41.503 --> 32:43.158
But watching you work,

32:43.182 --> 32:46.132
where you could
sense what Phara was feeling inside…

32:47.741 --> 32:48.742
That's special.

32:49.427 --> 32:51.155
Other people can't do that, Sal.

32:51.466 --> 32:53.093
I have absolute faith in you.

32:56.101 --> 32:58.895
I have absolute faith in you.

33:19.207 --> 33:21.960
Who among you
is Master Statistician Tivole?

33:25.964 --> 33:29.110
Empire. May the light never dim.

33:29.134 --> 33:30.736
May the light never dim.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.531
- You received my query.
- I did, Empire.

33:33.555 --> 33:35.783
But I can't say yet we have the results.

33:35.807 --> 33:38.852
How long has it been
since Dusk set you to this task?

33:39.436 --> 33:40.621
Three decades?

33:40.645 --> 33:44.875
What do you do
in your mausoleum of calculus

33:44.899 --> 33:48.468
if not achieve results?

33:49.988 --> 33:53.849
Progress, then. What is your progress?

33:54.659 --> 33:56.503
We believe

33:56.527 --> 34:01.189
the... the predictive models
of Hari Seldon to be counterfactual.

34:03.501 --> 34:05.819
And you believe this why?

34:06.337 --> 34:11.318
In the 35 years since Seldon uttered
his heretical proclamations,

34:11.342 --> 34:13.520
the Imperium has expanded,

34:13.544 --> 34:15.823
rather than
contracted, by every critical metric...

34:15.847 --> 34:16.847
Stop.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.535
Seldon's prophecies.

34:19.559 --> 34:24.248
Speak to me of his math,
this "ordinal analysis."

34:24.272 --> 34:27.001
It's a spread of fortune teller's cards

34:27.025 --> 34:31.136
which Seldon chose
to interpret as divination.

34:31.321 --> 34:32.382
Uh-huh.

34:32.407 --> 34:36.470
The verification he found
in the regression models is unsupported.

34:36.700 --> 34:40.556
But what of these...
these recent events?

34:40.580 --> 34:41.932
The conclave? Luminism?

34:41.956 --> 34:46.896
Baseless conjecture.
Again, vague and unsupported.

34:46.920 --> 34:51.114
I mean, anyone could predict
a return to orthodoxy.

34:51.508 --> 34:56.196
Psychohistory is the fanciful work
of an old man's imagination.

34:56.220 --> 34:58.908
If it weren't the fanciful work
of an old man's imagination, what then?

34:58.932 --> 35:01.503
What is the likelihood
that it's all true?

35:01.527 --> 35:02.894
Every prophecy?

35:03.728 --> 35:05.956
Vanishingly small, Empire.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.315
But not zero.

35:09.651 --> 35:10.902
Correct?

35:11.861 --> 35:13.905
Not zero?

35:14.656 --> 35:17.885
What kind of idiots are you?

35:17.909 --> 35:21.138
A thousand imperial mathematicians…

35:21.162 --> 35:24.100
…can't parse the numbers of one man?

35:24.124 --> 35:28.735
So there's nothing
anyone in the galaxy can do?

35:31.132 --> 35:35.116
Is that what it is?
Is that the best you've got?

35:36.678 --> 35:39.829
Tell me. Tell me!

35:41.641 --> 35:44.394
Tell me!

35:55.280 --> 35:57.633
In the twilight of a man's life…

35:57.657 --> 36:00.326
…When his biography is nearly complete,

36:00.952 --> 36:03.496
he grows desperate to know
the measure of his days…

36:05.457 --> 36:09.085
How his voice compares to
the chorus of those who've come before.

36:12.630 --> 36:16.116
Do I matter? Are my choices my own?

36:16.908 --> 36:20.513
Or is my destiny governed by
an unseen hand?

36:32.567 --> 36:34.712
Brother Day. Come to see us off?

36:34.736 --> 36:37.590
I was paid a visit
by your statisticians.

36:37.614 --> 36:40.593
It's remarkable
how self-reinforcing their results are.

36:40.617 --> 36:45.478
I think it's best that you stay
and tend to matters on Trantor.

36:45.872 --> 36:49.518
Empire, a primary Cleon has not left
the bosom of Trantor

36:49.542 --> 36:51.729
since the dawn of the Genetic Dynasty.

36:51.753 --> 36:52.986
Demerzel is right.

36:53.630 --> 36:56.484
We have these protocols in place
for a reason.

36:56.508 --> 37:03.098
And I say our protocols have
made us complacent.

37:03.807 --> 37:05.951
When you sat on the middle throne,
as I do now,

37:05.975 --> 37:08.454
and were debating what to do about
Anacreon and Thespis,

37:08.478 --> 37:11.921
what our response should be,
do you remember what you said?

37:13.149 --> 37:14.150
I do.

37:15.235 --> 37:16.611
Like it was yesterday.

37:17.195 --> 37:18.506
I was seven.

37:18.530 --> 37:21.675
Our eldest brother had argued
for a bout of grace.

37:21.699 --> 37:24.851
You turned to me and said,
"What do you think, Ascending Dawn?"

37:25.745 --> 37:27.247
I knew you were against grace,

37:27.872 --> 37:30.851
that you wanted to bomb
the barbarian kingdoms.

37:30.875 --> 37:35.278
But I was scared. And I dared say so.

37:35.880 --> 37:38.299
Well, I'm not scared anymore.

37:39.134 --> 37:40.538
On your watch,

37:40.562 --> 37:45.074
the Star Bridge fell. And from
that scar insurgency was birthed.

37:45.098 --> 37:47.576
On your watch,
two worlds were incinerated

37:47.600 --> 37:50.204
with not a care to
innocence or consequence.

37:50.228 --> 37:53.922
On your watch, Hari Seldon
and his followers were allowed to flee.

37:54.190 --> 37:57.670
You have bequeathed me
an Empire rent by impulsive action.

37:57.694 --> 38:01.805
The same will not be said of me.
Not on my watch.

38:02.198 --> 38:04.677
I would save our legacy.

38:04.701 --> 38:05.702
Brother…

38:07.036 --> 38:11.350
You are haunted by
the ghost of a man long dead.

38:11.374 --> 38:13.817
We all are, Brother.

38:18.256 --> 38:20.008
Your watch is over.

38:21.468 --> 38:23.100
You will stay on Trantor,

38:23.124 --> 38:25.865
tending to
the wounds you have allowed to fester.

38:25.889 --> 38:28.057
Go.

38:28.975 --> 38:31.436
Return Brother Dusk's belongings
to the palace.

38:42.655 --> 38:46.766
Certainly now the Empire will
no longer be rent by impulsive action.

39:18.775 --> 39:19.960
You summoned me, Empire?

39:19.984 --> 39:22.886
A communications buoy has gone dark
in the Outer Reach.

39:24.030 --> 39:25.722
Take your team and investigate.

39:26.324 --> 39:27.682
At once, Empire.

39:28.034 --> 39:29.035
Dorwin.

39:29.953 --> 39:32.681
Our dispatches from the Foundation
have become sporadic.

39:32.705 --> 39:33.849
Pay them a visit.

39:33.873 --> 39:37.752
And remind the Foundation that
Empire will not be kept in the dark.

40:41.900 --> 40:44.211
- Is that, uh...
- Doesn't look good, does it?

41:03.046 --> 41:05.388
Who is in charge here, Lewis? You?

41:05.412 --> 41:07.109
Or is it the Warden
with the coin tricks?

41:07.133 --> 41:09.528
Because it seems
she's managed to complicate matters.

41:09.552 --> 41:11.947
- Let me be clear, Huntress Keaen...
- Grand Huntress.

41:11.971 --> 41:13.574
The only reason we have a crisis

41:13.598 --> 41:17.119
is because you trespassed
on the Emperor's personal domain.

41:17.143 --> 41:20.414
If only Salvor had taken me to the tower
and given me what I'd wanted,

41:20.438 --> 41:22.124
we'd already be off-planet.

41:22.148 --> 41:23.709
The module from our slow ship?

41:23.733 --> 41:26.236
It's not as if
your people have any use for it.

41:26.736 --> 41:30.382
You're marooned on Terminus.
The Empire made sure of that.

41:30.406 --> 41:31.741
Lewis.

41:32.659 --> 41:33.808
Why do you need it?

41:34.160 --> 41:36.430
My people are technologically bankrupt.

41:36.753 --> 41:38.380
We're dying, Director.

41:38.873 --> 41:42.436
We have been ever since the Empire
set our atmosphere on fire.

41:42.460 --> 41:46.357
Half our population lost
for a crime that we were innocent of.

41:46.381 --> 41:48.275
Unlike you, we have ships.

41:48.299 --> 41:51.946
We can leave our poisoned world,
find another star system.

41:51.970 --> 41:55.199
If only we had
the means to navigate the void.

41:55.223 --> 41:56.992
The Empire would crush us
for assisting you.

41:57.016 --> 41:59.000
We're forcing your hand, Director.

41:59.895 --> 42:01.772
Because we have nothing left to lose.

42:02.678 --> 42:03.832
You can't play chess

42:03.856 --> 42:05.890
with someone
who's willing to set the board on fire.

42:09.821 --> 42:11.924
Is that some kind of flak cannon?

42:11.948 --> 42:14.593
Wasting their time if they think
that's gonna penetrate the fence.

42:14.617 --> 42:18.139
None of this feels right.
Phara is smarter than this.

42:18.163 --> 42:20.641
They took out the comms buoy,
and they came in prepared.

42:20.665 --> 42:23.254
There's a larger strategy here,
and I am missing it somehow.

42:23.283 --> 42:25.557
What if I take my ship,
make a run for the stars, get help?

42:25.594 --> 42:27.667
No, no. They'd shoot you out of the sky

42:27.691 --> 42:29.364
before you ever made it into orbit.

42:30.175 --> 42:31.986
Regretting you didn't bug out
when you had the chance?

42:32.010 --> 42:34.739
Done a lot of foolish things in my life,
Salvor Hardin.

42:34.763 --> 42:36.598
Sticking by your side
is not one of them.

42:37.932 --> 42:39.410
Best manservant ever.

42:50.653 --> 42:52.197
The Vault isn't Anacreon…

42:53.072 --> 42:54.175
Or alien at all.

42:54.199 --> 42:55.718
It's gotta be connected to Hari.

42:55.742 --> 42:56.802
How do you know that?

42:56.826 --> 42:58.703
Because the vision I saw
when I blacked out,

42:59.329 --> 43:02.070
it was on Trantor in Hari's library,

43:02.094 --> 43:03.958
with a boy holding a knife on me.

43:04.751 --> 43:06.419
What if it was a warning to stay away?

43:07.670 --> 43:09.231
What if Lewis is right?

43:09.255 --> 43:10.954
I'm an outlier, just like he says,

43:10.978 --> 43:12.443
barging around, knocking things over,

43:12.467 --> 43:13.819
screwing up Seldon's plan?

43:13.843 --> 43:16.346
Salvor, what if you are Seldon's plan?

43:18.598 --> 43:22.369
The fate of one individual
will always remain a mystery.

43:22.393 --> 43:26.832
Remember my promise, Warden?
Razing your city to the ground?

43:26.856 --> 43:28.876
But the movements of masses,

43:28.900 --> 43:32.445
the rise and falls of cultures,
causes and worlds…

43:33.279 --> 43:36.449
These were answers
Hari Seldon had long since unriddled.

43:37.117 --> 43:38.469
It's time.

43:38.493 --> 43:42.348
And the beginning of the end,
as befitting its name,

43:42.372 --> 43:44.397
took place on Terminus.
