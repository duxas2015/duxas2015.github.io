<i>Of all the stories
my mother used to tell me at bedtime,</i>

01:32.993 --> 01:35.162
<i>the black hole frightened me the most.</i>

01:38.435 --> 01:40.501
<i>It wasn't the darkness that scared me.</i>

01:41.245 --> 01:43.039
<i>I was comfortable in darkness.</i>

01:45.750 --> 01:48.425
<i>It was the idea of an event horizon.</i>

01:51.422 --> 01:53.289
<i>Venture into that horizon,</i>

01:53.318 --> 01:56.177
<i>and the gravitational pull
prevents you from turning back.</i>

01:57.720 --> 02:00.729
<i>Escape becomes impossible.</i>

02:16.864 --> 02:19.117
Gaal. Time for morning rites.

02:40.513 --> 02:42.241
We speak the words.

02:42.265 --> 02:44.898
And the words make us seen.

02:45.476 --> 02:49.111
Welcome forth this child among you,

02:49.814 --> 02:55.033
that he should be blessed,
loved and cherished,

02:55.903 --> 02:58.370
heard and seen,

02:58.740 --> 03:01.135
one with the Sleeper's words.

03:01.159 --> 03:02.874
Upon awakening.

03:03.077 --> 03:04.495
Upon awakening.

03:04.996 --> 03:07.747
Seer Dominie, we must check

03:07.771 --> 03:10.168
the university for forbidden activity.

03:13.536 --> 03:15.497
Acolyte Dornick.

03:17.091 --> 03:20.362
Seer Dominie said there were lights
in the windows last night.

03:20.386 --> 03:22.180
But the university's abandoned.

03:22.889 --> 03:23.931
Look.

04:27.412 --> 04:28.621
Instructor Sorn?

04:32.988 --> 04:33.989
Gaal?

04:34.813 --> 04:37.608
I heard you had become an acolyte.

04:39.215 --> 04:40.889
You look like your father now.

04:41.175 --> 04:44.655
So pious. Hunting for heretics.

04:44.772 --> 04:48.817
All the nights I spent
at your parents' table, talking

04:49.225 --> 04:51.662
while you fell asleep
in your mother's arms.

04:51.686 --> 04:54.998
Ah, they seem a million years away now.

04:55.022 --> 04:57.567
Your parents took
another path, didn't they?

04:59.026 --> 05:02.494
As did you. Quite another path.

05:02.947 --> 05:07.958
You can't be here, Mr. Sorn.
The Seers condemned this building.

05:08.202 --> 05:09.579
Heretical, right?

05:10.538 --> 05:14.292
All analytic learning goes against
the Faith of the Awakening.

05:15.042 --> 05:17.563
What do you deem it, Gaal?
You always had a sharp mind.

05:17.587 --> 05:20.673
Stop. Just drop the books and go.

05:21.799 --> 05:25.199
If the Seers find out you're here,
they'll kill you.

05:25.253 --> 05:26.488
Yes.

05:26.512 --> 05:29.348
When a planet wants you dead, you die.

05:29.849 --> 05:31.326
Run.

05:31.350 --> 05:33.412
They're just words on a page.

05:33.436 --> 05:34.729
Are they?

05:35.605 --> 05:37.732
Kalle's <i>Book of Folding.</i>

05:38.524 --> 05:41.319
She dedicated
her entire life to writing it.

05:42.862 --> 05:43.863
Chaos theory.

05:44.447 --> 05:48.534
Furthering knowledge is the most
noble work of humankind, Gaal.

05:49.202 --> 05:50.203
Remember that.

05:51.816 --> 05:52.817
Take it.

05:56.084 --> 05:57.376
I'll hold it for you.

06:00.129 --> 06:02.965
This "Cleanse" will pass, Gaal.

06:04.050 --> 06:05.802
The tides that rise will ebb.

06:06.427 --> 06:09.102
Not in our lifetime, but someday.

06:10.556 --> 06:12.350
All things have a cycle.

06:13.059 --> 06:15.859
After destruction, rebirth.

06:16.604 --> 06:19.494
Knowledge gives us ways to survive
the destruction

06:19.518 --> 06:20.959
till the rebirth arrives.

06:20.983 --> 06:23.444
- The floods...
- Are a warning from the Sleeper,

06:24.153 --> 06:27.033
a challenge we must overcome
in order to prove worthy

06:27.057 --> 06:28.550
of his Awakening.

06:28.574 --> 06:31.887
No. And you know it. No.

06:31.911 --> 06:34.122
Gaal?

06:36.958 --> 06:40.202
You need to leave. Please.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.880
We overmined the volcanic vents.

06:43.381 --> 06:45.966
We melted the ice caps. We did this.

06:45.990 --> 06:47.486
Not your slumbering god.

06:47.510 --> 06:48.845
There is no "we."

06:49.517 --> 06:52.938
I'm not on your side.
I'm not a kindred soul.

06:55.476 --> 07:00.606
Are you willing to test that conviction
against Kalle's numbers?

07:01.232 --> 07:03.151
- Huh?
- There.

07:06.612 --> 07:08.156
It's Dr. Sorn.

08:07.465 --> 08:10.903
Cleanse us, benevolent Sleeper,

08:10.927 --> 08:15.640
that we might be one with your words
and abide in your Dream.

08:16.305 --> 08:18.349
Upon awakening.

08:19.143 --> 08:20.520
Upon awakening.

08:23.940 --> 08:25.233
Acolyte Dornick.

08:26.109 --> 08:28.486
The Sleeper is watching.

08:47.088 --> 08:49.674
For this, he will be cleansed.

09:09.777 --> 09:12.655
This will not stop the sea from risingâ€¦

09:13.531 --> 09:16.260
Or the algae blooms from dying.

09:16.284 --> 09:18.875
Only knowledge can do that.

11:30.084 --> 11:33.093
Ceremony at 6:00.
You'll be assisting Seer Dominie.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.096
I can't go this eventide.

11:36.716 --> 11:38.890
I gotta venture further
out to find green.

11:39.218 --> 11:42.033
Water seems like it's
getting warmer now.

11:42.371 --> 11:43.782
Lots of dead algae.

11:43.806 --> 11:45.033
It's monsoon season.

11:45.057 --> 11:47.810
Did Dominie tell you
when you'd be advancing to votary?

11:48.311 --> 11:51.623
She trusts you more and more, Gaal.
I can see it.

11:51.647 --> 11:54.692
Votary comes with
a substantial honorarium, doesn't it?

11:55.818 --> 11:59.298
- Two hundred chitons a quarter.
- That will help.

11:59.322 --> 12:00.782
It won't be enough.

12:02.533 --> 12:03.910
The high floods are coming.

12:04.577 --> 12:06.829
Who are you to question
the Sleeper's word?

12:07.413 --> 12:09.016
The floods are coming.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.351
People are gonna die
unless everything is raised...

12:11.375 --> 12:12.376
Enough.

12:13.795 --> 12:15.254
Speak your devotions.

12:19.884 --> 12:22.136
Bless and be seen, O Sleeper.

12:22.762 --> 12:24.889
Thankful for your wisdom and dreams.

12:53.418 --> 12:55.592
I wanna send a tight-beam message.

12:57.922 --> 12:59.549
I was told you could help.

13:00.438 --> 13:03.108
No. Seers don't brook
any off-world contact,

13:03.594 --> 13:05.763
- unless it's church business.
- I'll pay.

13:09.698 --> 13:11.366
Fifty chitons.

13:14.522 --> 13:17.692
- Where you wanna tight-beam?
- Trantor. Streeling University.

13:39.172 --> 13:40.779
The Seers are saying someone on Synnax

13:40.803 --> 13:43.193
has entered an imperial
math competition.

13:43.217 --> 13:45.237
You have to stop this, Gaal.

13:45.261 --> 13:47.781
You're putting us all at risk
by pursuing this.

13:47.971 --> 13:49.187
Let it go.

15:06.426 --> 15:10.697
<i>Greetings, Ms. Dornick.
My name is Hari Seldon.</i>

15:10.721 --> 15:13.980
<i>I am a professor
at Streeling University, on Trantor.</i>

15:14.809 --> 15:17.204
<i>I would like to offer you
my congratulations</i>

15:17.228 --> 15:21.834
<i>on your novel resolution
to the Abraxas Conjecture.</i>

15:21.858 --> 15:24.211
<i>Since you've published your solution,</i>

15:24.235 --> 15:27.256
<i>several circles within academia
have seen fit to cast doubt</i>

15:27.280 --> 15:28.590
<i>upon your achievement.</i>

15:28.614 --> 15:31.760
<i>The Conjecture has stood
for centuries, after all,</i>

15:31.784 --> 15:33.661
<i>confounding the greatest minds.</i>

15:34.328 --> 15:37.707
<i>I suppose the fact that the answer
has come from someone on Synnax,</i>

15:38.291 --> 15:40.144
<i>and a young woman at that,</i>

15:40.168 --> 15:42.920
<i>has made it all the harder
for them to accept.</i>

15:43.421 --> 15:46.340
<i>But the beauty of
math is that it is pure.</i>

15:47.383 --> 15:49.469
<i>I have studied your solution,</i>

15:50.428 --> 15:54.974
<i>and I would like to offer you my support
by validating your proof.</i>

15:55.558 --> 16:00.980
<i>It is ingenious, elegant and true.</i>

16:01.564 --> 16:03.274
<i>Bravo, Ms. Dornick.</i>

16:04.358 --> 16:07.111
<i>I expect the doubting will cease soon.</i>

16:07.612 --> 16:09.614
<i>You've a remarkable mind.</i>

16:10.573 --> 16:12.461
<i>I would consider it a privilege if</i>

16:12.485 --> 16:14.827
<i>you would come to Trantor as my guest.</i>

16:15.328 --> 16:18.265
<i>You could walk my students
through your solution.</i>

16:18.289 --> 16:21.167
<i>I know they'd be fascinated
to learn how you achieved it.</i>

16:22.126 --> 16:26.065
<i>Undoubtedly, you'll hear
through official channels soon enough.</i>

16:26.089 --> 16:30.802
<i>But, well, I'm rather hoping
you'll accept my invitation first.</i>

16:35.306 --> 16:38.643
Thank you, Sleeper. Thank you.

16:45.066 --> 16:47.586
Someone from our village
communicating with Trantor?

16:47.610 --> 16:49.171
- It's disgraceful.
- They have to be punished.

16:49.195 --> 16:50.363
Gaal.

16:52.740 --> 16:53.741
Gaal.

16:57.245 --> 16:58.329
It's coming.

16:59.205 --> 17:01.683
Even raising everything
ten-rod won't save us.

17:01.707 --> 17:03.852
The math is undeniable.

17:03.876 --> 17:06.104
There'll be hurricane winds,
massive flooding...

17:06.128 --> 17:08.439
Are these the Sleeper's words
speaking through you?

17:08.463 --> 17:09.464
No.

17:10.675 --> 17:11.717
It's math.

17:13.787 --> 17:15.414
I solved the proof.

17:16.263 --> 17:18.266
I'm the one the Seers are looking for.

17:20.684 --> 17:23.956
Hari Seldon invited me to Trantor.
Come with me.

17:23.980 --> 17:25.189
Trantor?

17:26.327 --> 17:27.905
The machine world?

17:30.027 --> 17:31.868
I'd rather my daughter die.

17:47.754 --> 17:51.090
<i>As a child,
I had nightmares of black holes.</i>

17:54.051 --> 17:56.594
<i>I used to imagine what it would be like,</i>

17:56.618 --> 17:59.682
<i>drifting towards something miraculous,</i>

18:00.683 --> 18:05.354
<i>bearing witness to something
most minds could never even comprehend,</i>

18:07.190 --> 18:09.487
<i>then realizing too late</i>

18:10.278 --> 18:12.964
<i>that you had reached
the point of no return.</i>

18:15.615 --> 18:17.492
What have you done?

18:53.069 --> 18:56.494
<i>Even waking up, the terror continuedâ€¦</i>

19:01.815 --> 19:04.984
<i>â€¦like an echo, whisperingâ€¦</i>

19:29.522 --> 19:31.565
<i>â€¦diminishing in volume forever,</i>

19:32.557 --> 19:34.610
<i>but never quite dying out.</i>

19:55.381 --> 19:56.382
Hello?

20:08.227 --> 20:10.229
Hari?

20:18.071 --> 20:20.215
Hello? Is anyone there?

20:20.239 --> 20:21.704
Hello?

20:24.660 --> 20:26.388
Please. Please.

20:26.412 --> 20:28.015
Is anyone there?

20:28.039 --> 20:29.957
Please. Please.

20:39.383 --> 20:40.694
Let me...

20:40.718 --> 20:44.597
Let me out of here! Let me out!

20:49.393 --> 20:51.145
Let me out!

20:51.646 --> 20:53.665
Please. Let me out. Let me out!

20:53.689 --> 20:55.667
Help!

20:55.691 --> 20:57.461
Please.

20:57.485 --> 20:59.421
Please.

20:59.445 --> 21:01.739
No!

21:14.585 --> 21:17.147
<i>Uploading cryo-session data.</i>

21:17.171 --> 21:20.216
<i>Initiating Raych Foss arrival protocol.</i>

21:33.062 --> 21:34.272
Hello?

22:21.611 --> 22:23.338
Uhâ€¦

22:23.362 --> 22:24.673
Hello?

22:24.697 --> 22:26.657
<i>Command not recognized.</i>

22:27.492 --> 22:29.178
W-What is this place?

22:29.202 --> 22:31.764
<i>Identification required.</i>

22:31.788 --> 22:34.641
Um, this is Gaal Dornick.

22:34.665 --> 22:37.006
Where am I? What is this ship?

22:37.627 --> 22:40.713
Um, who's the captain?
Where... Where is everyone?

22:43.980 --> 22:45.315
Just me?

22:47.095 --> 22:49.013
Oh.

22:50.765 --> 22:51.766
Uhâ€¦

22:52.809 --> 22:53.935
Okay.

22:54.519 --> 22:59.111
I... I need to send a message
to Lewis Pirenne.

22:59.607 --> 23:00.959
Hail the <i>Deliverance.</i>

23:00.983 --> 23:06.590
<i>The</i> Deliverance <i>was decommissioned
on 12/11/12,072 E.I.</i>

23:06.614 --> 23:09.659
I-It can't be. It's still in mid-flight.

23:11.994 --> 23:14.205
12,072â€¦

23:15.706 --> 23:17.250
What year is it?

23:17.917 --> 23:19.419
How long was I asleep?

23:20.002 --> 23:23.440
<i>12,102 Era Imperial.</i>

23:23.464 --> 23:28.970
<i>Your cryo-session duration
was 34 years, 223 days.</i>

23:55.037 --> 23:56.390
What the hell are they doing?

23:56.414 --> 23:59.046
Spectral cloaking.
They're camouflaging it.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.043
But we already know it's here.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.528
They're not hiding it from us.

24:35.369 --> 24:36.430
Watchmen, status?

24:36.454 --> 24:38.669
They're firing at the western fence.

24:40.458 --> 24:42.673
I count 50 here in the east.

24:43.878 --> 24:46.089
I count at least that to the west.

24:46.672 --> 24:49.318
Hold your ground.
They're just trying to rattle you.

24:49.342 --> 24:50.384
Yes, Warden.

24:51.636 --> 24:54.281
- Here, here, here.
- I'm a scientist.

24:54.305 --> 24:56.950
Look, if you don't take that,
you'll be a dead scientist.

24:56.974 --> 24:58.035
Your choice.

25:12.573 --> 25:14.117
Your Grand Huntress is a liar.

25:15.159 --> 25:18.764
Everything she feels,
it's all curdled inside her.

25:18.788 --> 25:22.338
She comes to destroy,
no matter the cost.

25:22.834 --> 25:25.174
You underestimate the rest of us,
Warden.

25:27.922 --> 25:30.133
We all bear Anacreon's scars.

25:30.842 --> 25:31.843
Phara's different.

25:32.427 --> 25:36.657
Her game is over.
No next move, only a last one.

25:36.681 --> 25:40.452
You may have us outgunned,
but you're desperate.

25:40.476 --> 25:41.537
Scared.

25:41.561 --> 25:43.855
And desperate people make mistakes.

25:56.993 --> 25:58.387
Is thatâ€¦

25:58.411 --> 26:00.125
An imperial ship jumping in.

26:08.463 --> 26:11.178
I'll be damned. They actually showed up.

26:19.390 --> 26:22.101
There's an imperial ship orbiting
the planet. Just stand by.

26:23.686 --> 26:27.273
I knew the Empire would come for us.
I'm sure Hari did as well.

26:31.694 --> 26:33.196
Do you think they're gonna save us?

26:36.949 --> 26:39.303
- Status?
- Approaching Terminus, Commander.

26:39.327 --> 26:41.263
Pull up a wide-spectrum planetary scan.

26:41.287 --> 26:43.498
I want population,
power plants, weapons.

26:44.082 --> 26:47.144
Primary power source is a
geothermal cell ten klicks north.

26:47.168 --> 26:50.105
City's protected by a standard
imperial-issue energy barrier...

26:50.129 --> 26:51.732
Commander,
there's something you should see.

26:51.756 --> 26:53.735
There's three transport ships near that
geothermal cell,

26:53.759 --> 26:54.930
non-imperial make.

26:55.218 --> 26:56.598
Anacreon corvettes.

26:57.345 --> 26:59.323
Keep aiming for geosync
over Terminus City,

26:59.347 --> 27:02.076
but be ready to divert
to a landing trajectory.

27:02.100 --> 27:04.119
- Open up encrypted channels.
- We can't, sir.

27:04.143 --> 27:05.425
Not enough bandwidth,
since we don't have

27:05.449 --> 27:07.039
the communications buoy for relay.

27:07.063 --> 27:10.603
Try a public frequency then.
Let's ring their bell. Say hello.

27:16.531 --> 27:19.551
<i>Terminus City and Foundation Director
Lewis Pirenne.</i>

27:19.575 --> 27:22.763
<i>This is Commander Kray Dorwin
of the imperial vessel </i>Aegis.

27:22.787 --> 27:24.056
<i>Immediate report, please.</i>

27:24.080 --> 27:25.474
I'm here. I'm here.

27:25.498 --> 27:28.964
Lewis Pirenne, Commander.
Director of the Foundation.

27:29.335 --> 27:31.105
We formally request the Empire's aid.

27:31.129 --> 27:32.760
The Empire will grant you aid.

27:33.047 --> 27:35.192
However, we require information first.

27:35.216 --> 27:37.027
I'd like to speak
to your minister of defense.

27:37.051 --> 27:41.949
<i>Oh, we are a small outpost, Commander.
We have no armed forces.</i>

27:41.973 --> 27:43.784
A director of intelligence then?

27:43.808 --> 27:44.934
Uh...

27:46.185 --> 27:49.123
Who knows the movements
of the Anacreon troops?

27:49.147 --> 27:50.565
That'd be me, Commander.

27:51.107 --> 27:53.460
Salvor Hardin. Warden of Terminus.

27:53.484 --> 27:56.046
Uh, Commander, you should know
that the Anacreon kingdom

27:56.070 --> 27:58.465
has confessed to destroying
the comms buoy

27:58.489 --> 28:01.176
in the hopes that it would trigger
an imperial response.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.295
<i>I strongly advise you stay
clear until we can determine</i>

28:03.319 --> 28:04.346
<i>why they want you here.</i>

28:04.370 --> 28:06.849
Confessed? Who spoke for them?

28:06.873 --> 28:09.268
We have their leader
in custody, Commander.

28:09.292 --> 28:12.062
Phara Keaen. Their Grand Huntress.

28:12.086 --> 28:14.189
Have her brought to the tower.
I wanna lay eyes on her.

28:14.213 --> 28:16.608
- Of course, Commander.
- That's a mistake, sir.

28:16.632 --> 28:18.902
Phara's been angling for the tower...

28:18.926 --> 28:20.571
Hello?

28:20.595 --> 28:22.847
- Hello?
- They're jamming our local network.

28:23.931 --> 28:25.599
<i>Ten minutes, Director.</i>

28:25.623 --> 28:27.643
<i>Then I want this
Huntress in front of me.</i>

28:28.519 --> 28:31.582
He thinks we're a planet
of simpleminded rustics.

28:31.606 --> 28:33.834
Who cares what he thinks?
We shouldn't move her.

28:33.858 --> 28:35.763
Your daughter may be willing to defy
the Empire

28:35.787 --> 28:37.963
based on speculations, Mari,

28:37.987 --> 28:39.131
but I am not.

28:39.354 --> 28:41.398
Why wait until now to kill comms?

28:41.949 --> 28:44.720
They were listening in.
They know we're about to move her.

28:55.797 --> 28:57.507
The field relays are in the tower.

28:59.717 --> 29:02.696
Get everyone back to the city.
I need to get back to the brig.

29:02.720 --> 29:03.864
Why?

29:03.888 --> 29:05.431
Phara's taking down the fence.

29:24.659 --> 29:26.428
I need to send a communication.

29:26.452 --> 29:28.055
<i>Authorization required.</i>

29:28.079 --> 29:29.890
I... I need to send a message.

29:29.914 --> 29:32.601
<i>- Authorization required.</i>
- Just authorize me!

29:32.625 --> 29:34.186
<i>Command not recognized.</i>

29:35.586 --> 29:36.897
Set course for Terminus.

29:36.921 --> 29:38.482
<i>Authorization required.</i>

29:40.633 --> 29:41.860
Think.

29:41.884 --> 29:43.570
Think, think, think, think.

29:43.594 --> 29:46.848
Uhâ€¦ Okayâ€¦

29:48.391 --> 29:49.785
Umâ€¦

29:49.809 --> 29:52.733
Am I authorized to run a search?

29:53.104 --> 29:55.275
"Anything in the
imperial public record."

29:55.299 --> 29:56.274
Okay.

29:56.858 --> 29:59.448
Search population of Terminus.

30:01.343 --> 30:03.554
They made it.

30:04.407 --> 30:07.368
Ah. Okay.

30:10.163 --> 30:11.622
Okay. Umâ€¦

30:16.961 --> 30:20.840
Search Hari Seldon death.

30:25.511 --> 30:28.741
<i>Good evening. It is with a heavy heart
that I record this message.</i>

30:28.765 --> 30:34.288
<i>On the 8th of the 8th,
12,068 the Era Imperial,</i>

30:34.312 --> 30:35.605
<i>Hari Seldon was...</i>

30:38.775 --> 30:40.252
<i>Hari Seldon was murdered.</i>

30:40.276 --> 30:42.379
<i>He died from fatal stab wounds</i>

30:42.403 --> 30:45.549
<i>administered by his foster son,
Raych Foss,</i>

30:45.573 --> 30:47.968
<i>and Foss's accomplice, Gaal Dornick.</i>

30:47.992 --> 30:50.179
No. No.

30:50.203 --> 30:53.223
<i>As per Seldon's mortality directive,</i>

30:53.247 --> 30:55.875
<i>his body will be ejected
from this spacecraft</i>

30:57.210 --> 30:59.087
<i>in a casket he himself designed.</i>

31:02.715 --> 31:05.802
<i>In accordance with
the project's line of succession,</i>

31:06.385 --> 31:07.793
<i>it falls to me</i>

31:07.817 --> 31:11.825
<i>as senior councilman
to assume command of the Foundation.</i>

31:11.849 --> 31:13.160
<i>I believe with all my heart</i>

31:13.184 --> 31:16.973
<i>that every citizen upon this ship
was chosen for a reason.</i>

31:16.997 --> 31:21.234
<i>We will preserve and build upon
Hari Seldon's legacy.</i>

31:22.068 --> 31:26.285
<i>We will devote our lives
to protecting the Empire</i>

31:27.115 --> 31:30.868
<i>and all its citizens
from the coming fall.</i>

31:31.786 --> 31:33.287
<i>The Plan continues.</i>

31:35.248 --> 31:36.749
<i>May the light never dim.</i>

31:38.960 --> 31:41.425
Stop. Stop!

31:54.976 --> 31:56.144
Searchâ€¦

31:57.103 --> 31:58.479
Raych Foss.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.666
<i>Warning.</i>

32:00.690 --> 32:03.484
<i>Designate Hari Seldon's
life functions have ceased.</i>

32:06.362 --> 32:09.031
<i>Raych, why?</i>

32:10.939 --> 32:12.524
<i>Was... Was itâ€¦</i>

32:13.494 --> 32:14.708
<i>Premeditated?</i>

32:16.038 --> 32:19.226
We know you were arguing
with Dr. Seldon the night of his death.

32:19.250 --> 32:22.962
You were questioning his...
His forecasts just before,

32:24.046 --> 32:26.382
<i>implying that they were unstable.</i>

32:27.425 --> 32:29.594
For God's sake, say something!

32:30.678 --> 32:32.434
The man loved you like a son.

32:32.972 --> 32:36.813
He lifted you out of the heat sinks.
He saved youâ€¦

32:38.561 --> 32:40.354
As he would have saved us all.

32:41.355 --> 32:43.524
What could possibly
have possessed you to...

32:45.902 --> 32:47.629
Did Gaal Dornick put you up to it?

32:47.653 --> 32:50.382
She had nothing to do with this.
It was all me.

32:50.406 --> 32:52.217
<i>You don't have to protect her.</i>

32:52.241 --> 32:54.595
<i>It was me. I did what I had to do.</i>

32:54.619 --> 32:57.205
Why? Speak!

32:57.872 --> 33:00.309
Do you even understand
what it is you've done?

33:00.333 --> 33:01.769
I understand more than you.

33:01.793 --> 33:03.066
Then you admit

33:04.585 --> 33:06.315
that of your own free will

33:06.339 --> 33:08.692
and with full knowledge of your actions,

33:08.716 --> 33:11.361
<i>you murdered Hari Seldon?</i>

33:11.385 --> 33:12.465
No.

33:12.489 --> 33:13.800
<i>You understand what happens next.</i>

33:13.824 --> 33:15.102
No.

33:24.315 --> 33:25.566
Searchâ€¦

33:26.442 --> 33:27.610
Raych Fossâ€¦

33:28.820 --> 33:30.214
Execution.

33:44.710 --> 33:46.295
Any final words?

33:47.505 --> 33:49.674
I know it's hard.

33:51.759 --> 33:54.387
I know what I've done seems
incomprehensible.

33:55.888 --> 33:58.182
But you can't lose faith in the Plan.

33:59.392 --> 34:00.393
Ever.

34:01.269 --> 34:04.359
You have the gall to tell us
not to lose faith?

34:08.901 --> 34:10.754
<i>You can still solve a puzzleâ€¦</i>

34:14.115 --> 34:15.658
<i>â€¦even with a piece missing.</i>

34:18.910 --> 34:19.912
I...

34:24.167 --> 34:25.168
I...

35:16.928 --> 35:17.929
Shit.

35:28.147 --> 35:30.274
- Keep moving.
- I feel sick.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.587
I need a minute.

35:33.611 --> 35:36.739
I don't think we should stop here.

35:40.743 --> 35:43.263
What is she doing?

35:43.287 --> 35:44.584
What's happened?

35:47.667 --> 35:50.002
You should have trusted your warden.

35:51.546 --> 35:52.839
What is that?

36:14.318 --> 36:15.379
Poly, Laylo.

36:15.403 --> 36:17.697
You kids get back
to the city now, you hear?

36:18.281 --> 36:19.619
Do as I say!

37:29.977 --> 37:32.081
All things have a cycle.

37:32.105 --> 37:34.361
After destruction, rebirth.

37:34.982 --> 37:38.027
Knowledge gives us ways to survive
the destruction

37:38.051 --> 37:39.570
until the rebirth arrives.

37:55.336 --> 37:59.483
Computer, did the ship just conduct
a trajectory correction maneuver?

37:59.507 --> 38:02.569
- Are we beginning an orbital insertion?
<i>- Affirmative.</i>

38:02.593 --> 38:03.928
So we're slowing down.

38:05.054 --> 38:07.348
Which means
we're approaching a destination.

38:08.141 --> 38:09.952
Identify our destination.

38:09.976 --> 38:11.769
<i>Authorization required.</i>

38:20.695 --> 38:22.947
Am I authorized to see a star chart?

38:27.660 --> 38:30.097
How about inertial reference points?

38:30.121 --> 38:32.683
Can you show me
all celestial sphere locations

38:32.707 --> 38:34.500
of all quasars in direct line of sight?

38:36.335 --> 38:38.463
Highlight the Cloverleaf Quasar.

38:41.215 --> 38:43.110
Simple optical navigation.

38:43.134 --> 38:46.545
Okay, do we have direct line of sight to
Swen-Yen 214,

38:46.569 --> 38:49.616
Austus 11, Hudson 8,053?

38:49.640 --> 38:51.688
<i>- Affirmative.</i>
- Show them.

38:53.936 --> 38:55.526
Now show me the angular separation

38:55.550 --> 38:57.569
of the Cloverleaf and these three stars.

38:59.108 --> 39:03.756
Okay, display a cone
with a 23.5-degree half-angle.

39:03.780 --> 39:05.632
Also, display the central axis.

39:05.656 --> 39:08.191
Computer, can you trace out the surface

39:08.215 --> 39:10.036
of possible positions of the apex?

39:10.578 --> 39:13.081
Another cone? Thirty degrees half-angle.

39:14.499 --> 39:18.044
And give me a third cone,
half-angle of 62 degrees.

39:25.259 --> 39:26.431
We're right here.

39:27.595 --> 39:31.269
Which puts us in the Argo Sector,
near the Yu Ling Stream.

39:31.724 --> 39:33.535
Now, what direction are we heading in?

39:33.559 --> 39:35.037
<i>Authorization required.</i>

39:35.061 --> 39:38.874
Uh, do I have access to stellar spectra?

39:38.898 --> 39:40.876
<i>- Affirmative.</i>
- Yes. Okay.

39:40.900 --> 39:44.880
Show me the current
and nominal spectra for Swen-Yen 214,

39:44.904 --> 39:47.448
Austus 11, Hudson 8,053.

39:48.366 --> 39:49.992
Relativistic Doppler shift.

39:50.701 --> 39:52.995
I'm going to outsmart you,
you stupid ship.

40:02.255 --> 40:03.565
Okay.

40:03.589 --> 40:09.029
Uh, display a vector,
orientation in the galactic frame,

40:09.053 --> 40:14.392
bearing 289 degrees,
elevation minus 5.3 degrees.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.561
There!

40:17.437 --> 40:18.872
Is that our current velocity?

40:18.896 --> 40:20.958
<i>Authorization required.</i>

40:20.982 --> 40:23.669
Um, is the vector parallel
to the long axis of the <i>Raven</i>?

40:23.693 --> 40:25.045
<i>Negative.</i>

40:25.069 --> 40:28.590
Is the vector antiparallel
to the long axis of the <i>Raven</i>?

40:28.614 --> 40:29.869
<i>Affirmative.</i>

40:30.825 --> 40:35.705
Okay. So that last course correction
flipped the ship.

40:37.248 --> 40:38.458
We're slowing down.

40:42.378 --> 40:44.046
And our final destinationâ€¦

40:46.841 --> 40:49.472
Is here.

40:54.849 --> 40:59.663
Computer, is that an actual window
or a virtual view screen?

40:59.687 --> 41:00.938
<i>A view screen.</i>

41:05.943 --> 41:07.921
Are you displaying
all possible wavelengths

41:07.945 --> 41:10.132
that might reveal stars
or planets in the region?

41:10.156 --> 41:11.282
<i>Negative.</i>

41:11.866 --> 41:14.511
- So you're censoring what I'm seeing?
<i>- Affirmative.</i>

41:14.535 --> 41:16.704
So you don't want me
to see my destination.

41:17.497 --> 41:18.891
Why?

41:18.915 --> 41:23.020
<i>Access to primary destination
is restricted to Raych Foss.</i>

41:23.044 --> 41:24.796
Doesn't make any sense.

41:25.963 --> 41:27.840
I have to see it with my own eyes.

41:43.481 --> 41:48.236
86,981,959.

42:25.064 --> 42:26.458
Fall back!

42:26.482 --> 42:29.110
Fall back! Go! Go!

42:38.286 --> 42:40.472
- Mom!
- Here! Take this!

42:40.496 --> 42:42.377
Mom, let's go! Get out of here!

42:43.291 --> 42:44.629
Hurry up!

42:48.921 --> 42:49.982
What happened?

42:50.006 --> 42:52.693
She smuggled a field disrupter
into the building.

42:52.717 --> 42:55.237
- Where is she?
- At the curation storage.

42:55.261 --> 42:56.599
She has your mother.

43:04.645 --> 43:06.707
They've taken down
the imperial fence, sir.

43:06.731 --> 43:07.875
Cancel geosync.

43:07.899 --> 43:09.817
Commence landing. Maximum speed.

43:33.883 --> 43:35.134
Commander on deck!

43:36.260 --> 43:39.198
We make planetfall in five minutes.

43:39.222 --> 43:40.532
I want you to remember this.

43:40.556 --> 43:42.701
The Anacreons brought down
the Star Bridge.

43:42.725 --> 43:46.288
100 million dead at the hands
of these barbarians.

43:46.312 --> 43:48.916
I know this is personal for some of you,

43:48.940 --> 43:51.109
and that means
it's personal for all of us.

43:58.324 --> 44:00.761
- Right here, Warden.
- You okay?

44:00.785 --> 44:02.679
She needs the crew manifest
from the <i>Deliverance</i>.

44:02.703 --> 44:04.098
So that's what you're really after?

44:04.122 --> 44:06.558
We need help commandeering
an imperial ship.

44:06.582 --> 44:08.196
And we weren't gonna get it until

44:08.220 --> 44:09.812
we had a knife to your people's throats.

44:09.836 --> 44:11.605
So now put that rifle down.

44:11.629 --> 44:13.982
Or what? You shoot her?
You honestly think that's an incentive?

44:14.006 --> 44:16.735
Mothers are mothers. You won't fire.

44:16.759 --> 44:18.445
Because there's an invisible cord
between us?

44:18.469 --> 44:21.323
Everyone says it. But I gotta tell you,
I've never felt it.

44:21.347 --> 44:24.284
You want me to throw the Foundation away
to save her?

44:24.308 --> 44:25.677
Cry all you want, Mom.

44:25.706 --> 44:28.038
Try to feel it,
like when I was four at the Vault,

44:28.062 --> 44:30.332
- and you crawled on the ground.
- I was terrified.

44:30.356 --> 44:33.043
Do it, Phara. Shoot your leverage
and let's start over. Even.

44:33.067 --> 44:35.421
Shut up, or we'll both be orphans!

44:35.445 --> 44:36.505
Fine!

44:42.118 --> 44:44.805
- Mom, I am so sorry.
- You were telling me to drop, yes?

44:44.829 --> 44:46.515
- Drop and crawl?
- That's right, Mom.

44:46.539 --> 44:48.711
- That's all you meant?
- You did good, Mom.

46:31.310 --> 46:33.730
Easy. Easy. You can do this.

46:34.814 --> 46:36.691
Breathe. Just breathe.

46:48.327 --> 46:49.537
Okay.

46:50.121 --> 46:52.623
Destination should beâ€¦ here.

46:53.875 --> 46:55.793
Nothing.

47:11.934 --> 47:13.394
What are you hiding?

47:17.060 --> 47:18.603
I know something's out there.

47:19.611 --> 47:21.446
But nothing the naked eye can see.

47:23.413 --> 47:25.874
What could be out here that I can't see?

47:27.784 --> 47:30.661
Filter for infrared. Okay.

47:31.996 --> 47:35.666
White dwarf, supergiantâ€¦

47:37.335 --> 47:39.087
There you are.

47:39.670 --> 47:42.843
A dark star.
That's why I couldn't see you.

47:46.052 --> 47:47.136
A dark star.

47:50.598 --> 47:53.327
We're hovering. Altitude 1,000 meters.

47:53.351 --> 47:54.519
Open external comms.

47:56.274 --> 47:57.289
Stand down.

47:58.428 --> 47:59.708
<i>Stand down.</i>

47:59.732 --> 48:01.567
Hey, get out of here! Get out of here!

48:11.160 --> 48:12.286
Give it to me.

48:19.544 --> 48:21.897
Take a look, Warden. There.

48:21.921 --> 48:24.858
I understand what it is like
to lose everything.

48:24.882 --> 48:28.070
To watch your whole life burn.
I really do.

48:28.094 --> 48:30.656
The Empire took everything from me.

48:30.680 --> 48:33.617
And now we take everything from them.

48:33.641 --> 48:36.912
If your people really had
nothing to do with the Star Bridge,

48:36.936 --> 48:39.373
if Anacreon was innocent,

48:39.397 --> 48:41.417
how could you do the same thing
to Terminus?

48:41.441 --> 48:44.610
That's just it. Terminus isn't innocent.

48:45.278 --> 48:48.865
Seldon's predictions
inflamed the Empire.

48:49.532 --> 48:54.120
Because of what your prophet said,
my whole world burned.

48:54.829 --> 48:55.830
Watch.

49:34.744 --> 49:36.079
Hugo!

49:39.916 --> 49:41.435
<i>If you can see the sky,</i>

49:41.459 --> 49:44.545
<i>you are trespassing
on His Eminence's sovereign territory.</i>

49:45.213 --> 49:47.941
By the authority of Emperor Cleon XIII,

49:47.965 --> 49:51.427
surrender immediately or face death.

49:52.446 --> 49:53.864
Ironwood Leader,

49:54.889 --> 49:56.268
you're cleared to proceed.

49:59.685 --> 50:00.746
Fire.

50:05.525 --> 50:07.753
- Kinetic weapon alert!
- Fire antimissile!

50:07.777 --> 50:09.156
Too close for intercept.

50:43.229 --> 50:46.500
Does it hurt any less?
Your brother, your family?

50:46.524 --> 50:49.444
You know what,
I thought I might feel empty.

50:49.986 --> 50:52.256
But I think it does hurt less.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.115
We should kill her and be done.

50:54.949 --> 50:56.409
We stick to the plan.

50:57.618 --> 50:59.036
She'll stay quiet.

51:15.303 --> 51:18.031
There's only one habitable planet
that orbits a dark star.

51:18.055 --> 51:20.433
And there is no way I'm going there.

51:24.562 --> 51:27.249
Computer,
I know our destination is Helicon.

51:27.273 --> 51:28.444
Change course.

51:29.817 --> 51:31.697
Helicon is Hari's homeworld.

51:32.153 --> 51:35.364
They think I killed him. Change course.

51:36.923 --> 51:38.704
Computer, are you there?

52:10.108 --> 52:11.317
Hari?

52:14.112 --> 52:15.241
Hari?
