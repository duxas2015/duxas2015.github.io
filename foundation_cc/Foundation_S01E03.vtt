01:26.028 --> 01:28.155
Every world has ghosts.

01:29.073 --> 01:31.658
And every house is haunted by them.

01:33.744 --> 01:35.621
Even the palace of the Empire.

01:36.580 --> 01:39.458
Especially the palace of the Empire.

01:43.754 --> 01:45.172
Where have you been?

01:45.255 --> 01:47.174
With the systems programmers.

01:47.758 --> 01:49.760
Lately you've been with them
more than with me.

01:50.594 --> 01:52.429
You've set them a large task.

01:54.890 --> 01:56.475
Should we look to replace them?

01:56.558 --> 01:57.810
They'll see it through.

01:58.936 --> 02:02.022
I can count on you, Demerzel?

02:02.523 --> 02:04.316
To see it through?

02:05.084 --> 02:06.085
Of course, Cleon.

02:06.110 --> 02:07.319
And not just that.

02:08.653 --> 02:09.655
Everything.

02:10.447 --> 02:12.825
I always assumed
you'd stay on after I was gone.

02:12.908 --> 02:17.454
But it occurred to me,
in the near-darkness of my life…

02:19.624 --> 02:21.417
I shouldn't take anything for granted.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.877
I'm loyal to the Empire.

02:23.961 --> 02:27.589
Yes, but will the Empire
be loyal to you?

02:29.049 --> 02:31.468
It hasn't always shown
benevolence to your kind.

02:31.552 --> 02:35.389
You're becoming sentimental,
verging on maudlin.

02:37.433 --> 02:38.684
Well, I'm dying.

02:40.936 --> 02:42.855
And I'm leaving everything in pieces.

02:43.355 --> 02:45.232
Are you unhappy with your successor?

02:47.151 --> 02:50.320
We can still revisit
the idea of marriage and an heir.

02:50.404 --> 02:55.784
Demerzel, for all you are,
and maybe because of it…

02:58.162 --> 02:59.621
There are things you will never know.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.836
I may someday know death.

03:02.386 --> 03:03.637
Yes.

03:04.126 --> 03:06.920
But I doubt you will feel
it arrived too soon.

03:11.125 --> 03:14.253
I should have seen
the completion of the Star Bridge.

03:15.512 --> 03:19.558
Me. My mind. My eyes.

03:21.643 --> 03:24.813
We should have ridden up
to the orbital platform together

03:24.897 --> 03:27.316
and looked down on all that we had made.

03:28.692 --> 03:30.027
And one day we will.

03:32.821 --> 03:34.531
Your continuity is assured.

03:41.371 --> 03:44.541
- Do you think of him often?
- You know the way I am.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.545
I don't forget anything or anyone.

03:50.214 --> 03:52.341
Empire is always on my mind.

03:52.883 --> 03:56.136
The platform's orbit
is dying at an accelerated rate.

03:57.763 --> 03:59.227
Or so say the physicists,

03:59.251 --> 04:01.433
who worry it'll just
fall on their heads.

04:01.517 --> 04:03.393
Their job is to worry over those things.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.311
Is it not ours?

04:10.317 --> 04:13.821
Perhaps it is still yours,
but no longer mine,

04:15.072 --> 04:16.573
as it is no longer his.

04:17.286 --> 04:19.371
How you spend this
last day is up to you.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.287
Every one of you is different.

04:23.956 --> 04:25.165
Somehow I doubt that.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.287
But thank you for trying to make me
feel unique as

04:28.311 --> 04:30.671
I shuffle off the stage.

04:35.801 --> 04:37.094
It was hardest on him.

04:38.095 --> 04:40.597
He only had the infant Dawn
to place on the throne.

04:41.265 --> 04:42.849
A baby with his eyes.

04:44.226 --> 04:48.647
Identical in every respect,
but a baby nonetheless.

04:50.065 --> 04:52.359
When I think of him,
that's what I think.

04:53.736 --> 04:55.320
He also had you.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.809
Please see Master Ilan, Empire.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.618
He's waiting for your final fitting.

05:21.206 --> 05:22.625
Shall we?

05:27.227 --> 05:29.897
The details, they're perfect.

05:34.193 --> 05:35.778
For the pick stitching?

05:35.861 --> 05:37.404
The jade, I think.

05:44.453 --> 05:46.121
Shoo, shoo.

05:57.049 --> 05:58.342
I am sorry, Empire.

05:58.367 --> 05:59.618
I have lost weight.

05:59.643 --> 06:01.770
- I am sure your frame is...
- I am shrinking.

06:03.121 --> 06:05.623
The world is beginning to see me
from a distance.

06:06.975 --> 06:09.144
The garment is singular, Ilan.

06:10.521 --> 06:14.733
It will be a privilege
to wear it at my ascension.

06:14.817 --> 06:16.902
Thank you, Empire.

06:16.985 --> 06:19.696
- Shall we finish the job?
- Oh.

06:24.618 --> 06:28.038
Ilan, let's let the girl have the stage.

06:44.388 --> 06:45.768
Brother Dusk?

06:45.792 --> 06:47.558
I didn't know you'd be here.

06:52.307 --> 06:55.102
Anacreon. Thespis.

06:55.232 --> 06:57.818
I wonder if you will speak of them
after I'm gone.

06:57.901 --> 07:00.654
We have broken the barbarians.
Cast them adrift.

07:01.363 --> 07:03.824
What would you have us say
that you haven't said?

07:03.907 --> 07:05.269
I don't know.

07:05.293 --> 07:08.162
I'm still trying to decide
what to say that I haven't said.

07:08.245 --> 07:09.496
About the Outer Reach?

07:09.580 --> 07:10.733
About anything.

07:10.757 --> 07:15.294
About whether any of this
is truly within our power to control.

07:15.377 --> 07:20.215
However many words I have left,
I would hate to waste them.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.367
You waste them
when you speak of the Outer Reach.

07:22.392 --> 07:23.644
I speak of Seldon.

07:23.669 --> 07:24.670
A man long dead.

07:26.513 --> 07:27.556
And soon forgotten.

07:27.639 --> 07:31.185
Does that mean his words
have no more worth in this Empire?

07:31.210 --> 07:33.629
Brother, the Empire is strong...

07:37.733 --> 07:40.069
Cleon I's legacy.

07:40.152 --> 07:42.905
I wonder if there's a way to save it.

07:42.988 --> 07:46.700
Stabilize it with propulsive lifts?
Push it out into the heavens?

07:46.950 --> 07:48.118
To what end?

07:48.143 --> 07:53.164
To the end that we not destroy
the last remnants of Cleon I's dream

07:53.592 --> 07:55.010
for lack of our own.

08:02.424 --> 08:03.550
Brother Dusk.

08:05.302 --> 08:08.878
We are the great dream of Cleon I,

08:08.902 --> 08:10.724
not the Star Bridge.

08:17.564 --> 08:18.774
The dreamer.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.296
The scholar.

08:25.977 --> 08:27.604
The alchemist.

08:33.079 --> 08:34.247
And me.

08:50.347 --> 08:52.266
I've tried my whole life,

08:52.933 --> 08:56.520
but I don't think I've ever been able
to make that face.

08:57.911 --> 09:01.581
Come. Your brothers have your last gift.

09:02.568 --> 09:06.947
I would like to thank you, Brothers,
for this beautiful meal.

09:07.448 --> 09:11.160
I can taste the care
you put into each bite.

09:11.785 --> 09:17.374
Your time and your attention
is deeply appreciated.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.793
You're very welcome, Brother.

09:19.818 --> 09:22.570
But this is not the gift.

10:05.631 --> 10:09.676
Welcome to Trantor,
the eye of the Empire.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.637
It's been so long.

10:13.305 --> 10:15.057
He was glorious, wasn't he?

10:15.140 --> 10:16.809
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

10:16.892 --> 10:18.018
Indeed.

10:18.769 --> 10:22.523
And we will build something greater
in his honor. For you.

10:24.441 --> 10:27.528
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

11:58.535 --> 12:00.262
You can't be here.

12:01.385 --> 12:02.616
You know that.

12:02.641 --> 12:06.919
I can't be the first one
who wanted to see my youngest self.

12:07.002 --> 12:08.962
Which is why we made the rule.

12:09.046 --> 12:12.633
I've never heard that song before.
Or have I?

12:18.906 --> 12:21.617
No wonder the Empire loves you so.

12:23.333 --> 12:28.172
I find I cannot quite look on that child
as an innocent.

12:28.408 --> 12:29.826
Even if Seldon wasn't right…

12:31.985 --> 12:34.029
There is something unnatural in that.

12:36.323 --> 12:37.532
You must go.

12:39.057 --> 12:40.308
You should rest.

12:50.518 --> 12:53.938
Strange, watching yourself being born.

14:04.995 --> 14:08.457
Sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.167
I saw you tonight…

14:11.085 --> 14:14.338
Watching our first brother
in the old Star Bridge.

14:15.705 --> 14:17.457
Are we not enough?

14:19.093 --> 14:21.136
Is that why you miss him?

14:23.514 --> 14:25.474
Oh, no, sweet brother.

14:27.059 --> 14:28.268
You are enough.

14:41.490 --> 14:44.785
It's just that you always leave me.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.297
You have grown into our greatness,

15:39.423 --> 15:42.926
Brother Dawn, now Day.

15:56.482 --> 15:59.860
Thank you, Brother Dusk.

16:12.295 --> 16:15.833
And the new Dawn, just awoken.

16:16.502 --> 16:19.463
You have a long, beautiful day ahead.

16:25.828 --> 16:28.706
Brother Darkness, it's time.

16:44.244 --> 16:45.995
The dream lives on in you.

16:46.020 --> 16:49.325
Because you kept it alive in you.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.473
Shh. It's okay.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.104
You're all right.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.774
Everything is all right.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.903
No.

17:28.574 --> 17:30.325
Something's wrong.

17:48.969 --> 17:50.137
Demerzel.

17:51.263 --> 17:54.724
I don't forget anything or anyone.

17:56.393 --> 17:58.728
Empire is always on my mind.

18:42.314 --> 18:43.941
Shh.

19:03.919 --> 19:06.422
To be alive is to know ghosts.

19:13.554 --> 19:15.514
We hear their whispers if we listen.

19:19.977 --> 19:22.354
We are haunted by prophets, all.

19:25.941 --> 19:29.528
Are you certain you want it erased,
Brother Dawn?

19:29.611 --> 19:30.612
Yes.

19:31.447 --> 19:32.448
I've outgrown it.

19:38.537 --> 19:40.998
We ignore the dead at our peril.

19:45.419 --> 19:48.756
And as Empire cycled through
a generation of Cleons,

19:48.839 --> 19:51.467
the Foundation began
colonizing Terminus.

19:52.885 --> 19:56.221
The Empire underestimated Hari.
We all did.

19:57.931 --> 20:01.894
Hari had predicted the Cleons would opt
for exile over execution…

20:03.896 --> 20:06.648
That his followers' end point
would be Terminus.

20:20.245 --> 20:23.665
Every aspect of their arrival
was predetermined…

20:27.669 --> 20:29.505
When the colonists would land…

20:32.841 --> 20:34.802
Where they would build their outpost.

20:52.236 --> 20:54.571
So imagine their surprise

20:54.655 --> 20:58.783
when they discovered that
something else was already there.

21:01.870 --> 21:04.331
What in Seldon's name is that?

21:26.437 --> 21:28.021
It wasn't in the surveys.

21:28.105 --> 21:29.606
Should we go back?

21:29.690 --> 21:32.818
Go back where, Mari?
This was always a one-way journey.

21:33.569 --> 21:36.821
- I'll check it out.
- No. We go together.

21:44.830 --> 21:46.665
Lowre, are you all right?

21:46.749 --> 21:47.833
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Come on.

21:47.916 --> 21:50.294
- I'm just a little light-headed.
- Come on.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.175
Get back.

21:58.802 --> 22:00.554
Abbas! Get back.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.818
It became known as the Vault.

22:15.652 --> 22:18.572
And over the decades,
countless myths grew up around it.

22:20.736 --> 22:23.572
It was an ancient
artifact left by aliens…

22:26.413 --> 22:29.083
A surveillance outpost
sent ahead by the Cleons.

22:31.293 --> 22:33.420
All the settlers knew for certain

22:33.504 --> 22:37.091
was that the Vault wouldn't allow
anyone to approach it.

22:38.342 --> 22:40.719
And so they kept away.

22:56.151 --> 22:57.861
The slow ship was scuttled…

22:59.696 --> 23:01.573
A refuge built from its bones.

23:06.453 --> 23:10.498
And what was once mysterious
became mundane.

23:16.338 --> 23:18.090
Her teachers say she's difficult.

23:19.383 --> 23:20.674
She's an outsider.

23:22.052 --> 23:23.178
Good.

23:23.262 --> 23:25.139
You're not listening to me, Abbas.

23:25.806 --> 23:26.931
She's a dreamer.

23:28.058 --> 23:30.102
She's distracted.

23:31.937 --> 23:33.814
She's a thinker, like you.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.485
She's not distracted.

23:39.903 --> 23:41.153
She's aware.

23:41.780 --> 23:45.199
Just look at her.
She's fascinated by it.

23:50.205 --> 23:51.206
It's pretty.

23:52.791 --> 23:54.042
It's dangerous.

23:54.126 --> 23:55.919
What do you think's inside it?

23:56.003 --> 23:57.880
We don't know.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.882
Then how do you know it's dangerous?

24:06.388 --> 24:07.389
Come on.

25:15.958 --> 25:16.959
There you go.

25:18.836 --> 25:19.837
Get away.

26:04.339 --> 26:06.762
One of these days you'll get me,
and you'll be so sorry.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.135
You're looking good.

26:08.218 --> 26:09.636
Yeah, coordinated.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.930
- Which parts?
- Right boot with left boot.

26:12.107 --> 26:13.650
How did I miss that?

26:14.391 --> 26:16.226
How goes the wild work?

26:16.310 --> 26:18.270
Just got back from
patrolling the highlands.

26:18.353 --> 26:21.315
Lichen beds are shrinking.
Ice lunes are already heading south.

26:21.398 --> 26:23.275
Means we're gonna
have a nice warm spring.

26:23.544 --> 26:24.796
Tell me you don't miss it.

26:25.569 --> 26:27.321
What, the stench of sulfur?

26:28.614 --> 26:29.615
And the frostbite?

26:29.698 --> 26:33.118
Nah, being a warden suits you
a lot better than it ever did me.

26:35.370 --> 26:37.414
Wow. That's a big one, hey?

26:37.498 --> 26:42.127
Yeah. Bishop's claw, female.
Maybe 600 kilos.

26:42.211 --> 26:45.130
She's been testing the fence
late at night the last few weeks.

26:45.214 --> 26:48.607
I'm gonna call her Maybel.
She's a loner.

26:50.302 --> 26:53.472
Salvor, why have you got me out here
at this time in the morning, huh?

26:55.469 --> 26:58.555
I know when my daughter's
procrastinating. Come on.

26:59.730 --> 27:01.648
I did a little test.

27:03.732 --> 27:06.485
Something's wrong with the null field.

27:07.069 --> 27:08.862
And what made you check it now?

27:08.946 --> 27:10.364
I don't know. A feeling?

27:11.824 --> 27:13.659
I checked it out. I got evidence.

27:13.742 --> 27:15.619
Of course. And have you told her yet?

27:15.867 --> 27:17.202
Wanted you to know first.

27:17.227 --> 27:20.313
I appreciate that.
But it is for her to know.

27:22.460 --> 27:24.168
And stress the evidence part.

27:54.992 --> 27:57.327
Thanks to the efforts of Dr. Seldon,

27:57.411 --> 28:00.080
Cleon XII established our refuge…

28:00.164 --> 28:01.330
In terms of timekeeping,

28:01.354 --> 28:03.361
the water clock
is the more precise instrument.

28:03.452 --> 28:08.338
Right. But it also requires water
to work, doesn't it?

28:08.422 --> 28:09.715
Well, obviously.

28:09.798 --> 28:12.050
What happens when the water runs out,
Novice Jord?

28:12.134 --> 28:14.206
For a sundial,
all you need is the gnomon.

28:14.230 --> 28:16.013
That's the blade sticking out of it.

28:16.096 --> 28:18.764
And, of course… the sun.

28:19.224 --> 28:23.825
Hari Seldon entrusted us
with rebuilding civilization

28:23.849 --> 28:25.355
after the collapse.

28:25.439 --> 28:26.648
We can't assume anything.

28:26.732 --> 28:29.151
Whether or not our future survivors
will be able to read,

28:29.293 --> 28:30.586
or what language they'll speak.

28:30.611 --> 28:33.489
We don't even know
what worlds they'll be scattered upon.

28:34.490 --> 28:37.491
What if they find themselves
on Cygnus Prime,

28:37.910 --> 28:41.121
where the only moisture to be gained
is from weeping vines?

28:41.205 --> 28:45.207
So, yes, this water clock
is more precise,

28:46.085 --> 28:47.753
but the sundial is more practical.

28:47.778 --> 28:49.355
We can't provide for every condition or

28:49.379 --> 28:51.532
contingency our descendants will face.

28:51.673 --> 28:53.894
By the same token,
we can't preserve every innovation,

28:53.926 --> 28:56.428
so we have to choose and keep choosing.

28:58.263 --> 28:59.807
Until the fall comes.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.990
I'd have picked the water clock.

29:02.015 --> 29:04.684
And you could have,
if you were still training here.

29:05.062 --> 29:06.563
Sorry, that was...

29:06.647 --> 29:08.190
I know you're suited to where you are,

29:08.215 --> 29:10.301
keeping us safe,
making sure the Foundation survives...

29:10.442 --> 29:12.236
I'm making sure you survive.
The Foundation...

29:12.319 --> 29:14.007
It's the same thing.
We are the Foundation.

29:14.032 --> 29:17.391
I am not.
But you believe. And that is fine.

29:17.533 --> 29:19.575
No. Do not make this sound like a cult.

29:19.644 --> 29:20.826
Some of us in our generation,

29:20.850 --> 29:22.704
some of us know what real
religious fervor looks like.

29:23.034 --> 29:25.411
Do you even wanna know
what I came to tell you?

29:30.379 --> 29:32.099
You know I don't like being near it.

29:32.124 --> 29:33.559
Dad said you'd want evidence,

29:33.583 --> 29:35.492
and this you gotta experience
for yourself.

29:38.674 --> 29:40.092
The null field is expanding.

29:41.521 --> 29:44.691
The field used to start there.
Now it starts here.

29:46.353 --> 29:49.398
If it keeps expanding,
we might need to clear out the town.

30:15.716 --> 30:17.676
I remember the first time
I found you out here.

30:18.635 --> 30:20.721
Four years old, middle of the night,

30:21.597 --> 30:25.017
standing right under it
like it was… nothing.

30:27.478 --> 30:29.563
And you wouldn't turn
when I called your name.

30:30.147 --> 30:32.191
Yeah, I thought it was calling to me.

30:32.607 --> 30:33.691
The ghost.

30:35.194 --> 30:36.528
Like an imaginary friend.

30:38.197 --> 30:40.325
I lay on the ground and tried
to crawl to you,

30:40.349 --> 30:41.576
but the pain was too great.

30:41.823 --> 30:43.158
You just…

30:44.870 --> 30:45.954
looked at me.

30:47.748 --> 30:50.503
I couldn't understand
why the Vault was hurting you

30:50.787 --> 30:52.012
but not me.

30:52.252 --> 30:53.504
You're special, Salvor.

30:54.797 --> 30:56.006
You always have been.

30:58.509 --> 30:59.885
Then why keep it a secret?

31:02.971 --> 31:05.307
Your father and I didn't want
people treating you differently.

31:05.390 --> 31:08.977
Yeah, but they do, Mom.
They always have.

31:11.980 --> 31:13.315
I make them uncomfortable.

31:14.024 --> 31:15.275
Just like the Vault.

31:15.359 --> 31:16.902
Is it calling to you now?

31:19.405 --> 31:20.447
Not in words.

31:21.782 --> 31:23.117
Make your case.

31:25.953 --> 31:27.204
I think it's waking up.

31:28.139 --> 31:29.640
You and the other encyclopedists,

31:29.665 --> 31:33.669
you've been preparing for
some distant crisis.

31:36.463 --> 31:37.714
But I think it's here.

31:38.924 --> 31:39.925
Now.

31:43.429 --> 31:46.014
Gia! Keir! Guys, Hugo's here!

31:46.640 --> 31:49.810
- Hugo's here!
- Hugo's here! Hugo's here, come on.

31:50.477 --> 31:52.646
- Hugo's here!
- Come on, Hugo!

31:52.671 --> 31:54.382
- Hugo!
- Hugo!

31:54.980 --> 31:56.483
Hugo!

31:56.567 --> 31:58.527
Whoa. Look at that! Come on.

32:05.993 --> 32:08.912
- Cut through this way!
- Whoa. Hey, now. Hey!

32:08.996 --> 32:10.873
- Oh, you can't get me.
- Through here.

32:10.956 --> 32:14.042
Come on, guys. Come on.
Hurry up! Let's go!

32:14.126 --> 32:16.170
Poly, come on! Hurry up!

32:16.795 --> 32:19.006
Hugo! Hugo!

32:22.760 --> 32:24.720
- Hugo!
- Hugo!

32:24.803 --> 32:26.013
Four-sworn, Hugo!

32:26.096 --> 32:29.391
Gentlemen, ladies.
What can I do for you grown adults?

32:29.475 --> 32:30.851
Got anything for us?

32:31.810 --> 32:34.394
Korellian chocolate.
Knock yourselves out.

32:34.813 --> 32:37.524
We don't want chocolate.
How about some beer?

32:38.023 --> 32:40.652
How about you come back and see me
when you got hair on your chest?

32:40.736 --> 32:42.529
And don't come begging for it
like wayward puppies.

32:42.613 --> 32:44.865
We're not begging. We're… trading.

32:44.948 --> 32:47.127
Is that so? What for what?

32:47.199 --> 32:50.035
How about our sparkling wit and company?

32:50.370 --> 32:51.371
Hard pass.

32:53.916 --> 32:54.917
Tell you what.

32:56.085 --> 32:58.087
If you clowns could help me load out,

32:58.170 --> 32:59.573
I might be able to scrounge up something

32:59.597 --> 33:01.048
a little more age-appropriate for you.

33:01.131 --> 33:02.841
Deal. I'll do it.

33:02.925 --> 33:04.009
We all will.

33:04.093 --> 33:05.094
Go on then.

33:05.177 --> 33:06.595
- Come on, guys.
- Come on.

33:06.678 --> 33:08.680
- Keir, catch. Poly.
- I'm here.

33:22.361 --> 33:23.445
That smells terrible.

33:24.029 --> 33:26.698
It should.
It's sealant for my gum boots.

33:26.782 --> 33:28.073
More onions than I expected.

33:29.034 --> 33:30.744
I may have used the wrong recipe.

33:30.828 --> 33:32.496
That would be a tragic mishap.

33:34.581 --> 33:35.666
It'll keep.

33:37.626 --> 33:38.669
What's wrong?

33:39.503 --> 33:40.796
There's a man in my kitchen.

33:45.156 --> 33:46.324
How long are you here?

33:47.458 --> 33:49.710
Twenty-nine long hours.

33:51.098 --> 33:52.975
And how's the rest of the galaxy?

33:53.058 --> 33:54.059
Oh, it's big.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.326
You should see it sometime.

33:57.312 --> 33:58.313
Should I?

34:08.949 --> 34:10.407
Irina Four.

34:11.285 --> 34:13.412
Only one continent,
but it's tropical all over.

34:13.494 --> 34:16.037
It's got bugs the size of dogs
and just as cuddly.

34:16.999 --> 34:19.084
Dropped off medicine, I picked up fruit.

34:19.168 --> 34:21.587
Such is the itinerant life
of the wayward purveyor.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.296
- Where'd you take the fruit?
- To Hesperus.

34:24.673 --> 34:27.134
Which you could describe
as well as me by now.

34:27.217 --> 34:31.012
But I was off on a whirlwind tour
of this little cluster.

34:32.347 --> 34:34.433
Once they started trading,
they couldn't stop.

34:34.516 --> 34:38.395
Little rectangular situation
of workers and sugar, rum, cash.

34:40.021 --> 34:43.192
You think you've got a handful of moons,
you should see what they got.

34:43.275 --> 34:45.360
The sky looks like spilled coins.

34:45.443 --> 34:47.195
- Spilled coins?
- Mm-hmm.

34:47.279 --> 34:48.739
I'd love to see that.

34:48.822 --> 34:51.742
Well, you need to go.
Get off this ball of ice.

34:53.077 --> 34:56.121
- I've got responsibilities here.
- Oh, but you didn't pick them.

34:56.204 --> 34:57.998
Nah, they're still mine. And…

34:59.833 --> 35:01.554
Is it possible to know
you've got reasons

35:01.578 --> 35:02.563
and not know what they are?

35:02.653 --> 35:04.296
Reasons you're important to this place?

35:05.297 --> 35:07.549
It's possible.
A little egotistical, but possible.

35:07.633 --> 35:09.968
I didn't say I was important.
I said I can't leave.

35:13.013 --> 35:15.516
Speaking of leaving,
would you like dinner now or after?

35:17.262 --> 35:18.263
After sounds good.

36:16.285 --> 36:17.536
What are you doing?

36:19.496 --> 36:20.497
Is something wrong?

36:21.874 --> 36:24.793
Just a weird feeling.
I'm gonna walk the perimeter.

36:24.877 --> 36:27.588
What, because that's
where the weird feeling is coming from?

36:27.613 --> 36:29.057
No, that is in here.

36:30.218 --> 36:31.511
This is just a walk.

36:31.536 --> 36:35.237
So if I said,
"Let me get my pants," you'd say?

36:35.262 --> 36:39.306
No pants for the next 25 hours.

36:42.478 --> 36:44.728
- Will you be mad later?
- Never.

37:05.292 --> 37:06.710
What are you doing out there?

37:09.713 --> 37:10.881
Stop!

37:17.971 --> 37:20.474
Stop. It's after curfew.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.869
Hello? Hello?

38:13.442 --> 38:14.443
Who are you?

39:06.413 --> 39:07.581
What the hell?

39:08.332 --> 39:09.833
I heard a shot. What's up?

39:09.917 --> 39:12.667
Am I crazy, or is that ship Anacreon?

39:17.716 --> 39:19.090
Oh, you're crazy.

39:19.468 --> 39:20.677
But not about that.

39:29.770 --> 39:31.480
And then there are three.

39:31.980 --> 39:34.316
- Hail them.
- We already have. No answer.

39:34.399 --> 39:36.443
And they're ignoring
our approach vectors.

39:36.585 --> 39:38.462
Should we send one of our shuttles
to meet them?

39:38.487 --> 39:39.780
Your unarmed shuttles?

39:40.864 --> 39:43.242
Those are corvettes. Gunships.

39:43.383 --> 39:44.676
Why is he here?

39:44.701 --> 39:46.703
Because he knows
what gunships look like.

39:46.845 --> 39:48.180
Also, he's Thespin.

39:48.205 --> 39:49.581
Been off-world since the bombings.

39:50.249 --> 39:51.750
Impossible. That would make you...

39:51.834 --> 39:55.170
Pushing 70. But I spent half that
cryosleeping between ports.

39:55.712 --> 39:57.965
When you tow freight to Anacreon,
it pays to be blood-neutral.

39:58.048 --> 40:01.552
- Anacreon is under imperial sanction.
- Grow up, Lewis.

40:01.635 --> 40:04.596
Maybe it's a mistake.
Maybe they wandered off course.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.598
They're literally trying to sneak in
under our radar.

40:06.682 --> 40:09.768
We are a scientific outpost.
We have nothing of value here.

40:09.852 --> 40:12.396
Mayor, have the Anacreons
ever made landfall here before?

40:12.479 --> 40:15.315
No Anacreons, no Thespins.
No one in 30 years.

40:15.399 --> 40:18.193
Under imperial edict,
Terminus is off-limit to all of them.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.168
It's gotta be connected to the Vault.

40:20.298 --> 40:21.591
What?

40:22.156 --> 40:23.949
The null field's expanding.

40:24.032 --> 40:25.367
- I noticed it yesterday.
- How fast?

40:25.451 --> 40:27.202
The very next day,
the Anacreons showed up.

40:27.286 --> 40:29.830
Technically, we are an imperial outpost.

40:29.913 --> 40:33.292
And Lord knows the Anacreons have
a bone to pick with the Empire.

40:33.375 --> 40:35.055
Are you suggesting
the Vault might be an Anacreon...

40:35.086 --> 40:37.862
I'm suggesting the Vault knew something
and reacted.

40:37.887 --> 40:39.138
Maybe it even warned us.

40:39.339 --> 40:41.552
Are you saying the
Vault was signaling you

40:41.965 --> 40:44.553
because you're somehow, what, special?

40:45.137 --> 40:47.264
Salvor is an outlier.

40:47.347 --> 40:49.975
We need to think whether the Plan
could have possibly predicted...

40:50.000 --> 40:51.293
Forget the Plan.

40:51.435 --> 40:52.603
Seldon's gone.

40:53.645 --> 40:55.606
When are any of you
gonna start thinking for yourselves?

40:55.631 --> 40:58.843
All right, that's enough.
We don't need to make this complicated.

40:58.984 --> 41:00.835
The Anacreons have ignored our hails,

41:00.859 --> 41:03.595
and they are violating
imperial aerospace.

41:03.665 --> 41:05.324
Our course of action is obvious.

41:05.407 --> 41:07.201
We'll uplink to the communications buoy

41:07.284 --> 41:09.495
as soon as we hit
the next rotational window.

41:10.079 --> 41:12.873
We'll call the Empire,
and they will come.

41:14.208 --> 41:15.667
Where are you going?

41:15.751 --> 41:17.086
To check out the armory.

41:18.754 --> 41:21.131
If the Anacreons come knocking
before the Empire,

41:21.215 --> 41:23.801
I'd like to know what kind of violence
we can muster.

41:24.927 --> 41:26.678
When was the last time
these were broken down?

41:26.703 --> 41:29.372
- So we're a little complacent.
- I've got an ion pistol, if that helps.

41:29.515 --> 41:31.433
Mom, anything we could use
in the curation stores?

41:31.517 --> 41:34.103
A few hand axes,
a shepherd's sling from Weaver's World.

41:34.186 --> 41:36.355
- I should've been on top of this.
- Not your job.

41:36.438 --> 41:39.066
- No? I keep you safe, remember?
- Come on. Come on.

41:39.149 --> 41:41.610
Generally I propose alcohol
at a juncture like this.

41:42.611 --> 41:44.154
Rotational window's open.

41:45.292 --> 41:47.961
Handshake protocol.
It just takes a few seconds.

42:00.605 --> 42:01.772
What's wrong?

42:01.797 --> 42:05.008
Comms buoy's not responding
to any of our pings. It's gone dark.

42:05.801 --> 42:07.010
Use another one then.

42:07.271 --> 42:08.564
There isn't another one.

42:08.589 --> 42:09.799
So, what does that mean?

42:10.264 --> 42:11.765
We can't contact the Empire.

42:14.017 --> 42:16.437
Well, keep trying. Don't panic.

42:16.753 --> 42:20.006
Could be something as simple as
a meteor shower. It'll clear.

42:20.649 --> 42:22.649
On the heels of an Anacreon flyby?

42:23.360 --> 42:25.904
Assuming the Anacreons
intend landfall here,

42:25.988 --> 42:27.406
how long before they arrive?

42:27.629 --> 42:31.091
Based on their current approach,
I'd say another 40 hours.

42:38.375 --> 42:39.376
Mom.

43:15.329 --> 43:16.330
Whoa.

43:18.457 --> 43:19.458
What is that?

43:21.418 --> 43:22.711
Psychohistory.

43:23.837 --> 43:26.673
All of Hari's work
expressed as a mathematical equation.

43:27.341 --> 43:29.760
I took it from his office
the night after his funeral.

43:30.886 --> 43:33.845
His numbers are the basis
for why we do what we do.

43:34.681 --> 43:37.810
On the ship, there were two people
who could actually understand it.

43:37.835 --> 43:39.517
Hari Seldon and Gaal Dornick.

43:46.151 --> 43:47.528
Can you make anything of it?

43:47.611 --> 43:49.363
Me? No, not likely.

43:49.906 --> 43:53.698
Salvor, if you were part of the Plan,

43:54.516 --> 43:57.435
it would make it a lot easier
for me to believe in all this.

44:31.747 --> 44:33.498
Yeah, well, big surprise.

44:34.450 --> 44:35.492
It was worth a shot.

44:35.576 --> 44:36.827
Was it?

44:37.394 --> 44:39.438
I told you,
different's not the same as special.

44:59.057 --> 45:00.476
Comms buoy is down.

45:02.227 --> 45:03.854
That is an ominous happenstance.

45:04.563 --> 45:06.148
You should probably hightail it.

45:08.358 --> 45:09.359
Oh, yeah?

45:11.111 --> 45:14.823
The Anacreons will be here in two days.
Maybe less.

45:15.557 --> 45:17.600
You would be safer anywhere but here.

45:18.452 --> 45:20.537
The scenery is so beautiful
this time of year.

45:21.246 --> 45:23.582
Vast wastelands of frozen lune shit.

45:23.665 --> 45:24.875
I'm serious, Hugo.

45:24.958 --> 45:25.959
You tend to be.

45:28.378 --> 45:29.546
I'm not going anywhere.

45:29.630 --> 45:30.964
This isn't your fight.

45:31.048 --> 45:33.383
Oh, yeah? Whose fight is it then?

45:39.389 --> 45:40.390
Seldon's?

45:42.267 --> 45:43.852
Then it's not your fight either.

45:46.647 --> 45:47.648
Come away with me.

45:49.066 --> 45:50.067
I can't.

45:50.150 --> 45:51.151
Why not?

45:54.113 --> 45:55.572
Because I have to protect them.

45:58.450 --> 46:00.661
To be alive is to know ghosts.

46:01.745 --> 46:05.249
The Empire feared Hari
because he could forecast the future.

46:06.667 --> 46:10.504
But, in reality, all he was doing
was reexamining the past.

46:14.383 --> 46:15.801
What do you want?

46:17.553 --> 46:21.765
Pay attention to the patterns
and we can presage what comes next.

46:26.228 --> 46:28.689
To be alive is to know ghosts.

46:29.398 --> 46:31.900
We hear their whispers if we listen.

46:52.671 --> 46:53.797
You again.

47:26.705 --> 47:27.748
Hey there.

47:31.919 --> 47:33.170
What got you, Maybel?

47:41.303 --> 47:42.510
This is gonna hurt.

47:56.110 --> 47:57.111
Easy.

47:58.904 --> 48:00.114
Drop your weapon.

48:06.787 --> 48:07.830
Who are you?

48:07.985 --> 48:11.697
Salvor Hardin, warden of Terminus.

48:16.672 --> 48:19.174
Anacreons aren't allowed
on imperial soil.

48:23.321 --> 48:24.447
What are you doing here?

48:25.139 --> 48:29.768
The ghosts of the dead haunt
the skeletons that were once our homes.

48:30.388 --> 48:31.973
They surround us.

48:32.271 --> 48:35.146
And they're hungry for what's ours.
