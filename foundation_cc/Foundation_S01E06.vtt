01:26.301 --> 01:29.471
<i>As a child,
I heard stories about Trantor,</i>

01:30.972 --> 01:34.226
<i>the city that was a planet
at the heart of the galaxy.</i>

01:36.269 --> 01:38.068
<i>I was told the people who lived there</i>

01:38.092 --> 01:40.565
<i>were sinners who
followed a false prophet…</i>

01:42.734 --> 01:46.238
<i>A man who believed himself
above the Sleeper's words.</i>

01:48.031 --> 01:49.616
<i>I didn't believe the stories</i>

01:50.492 --> 01:51.618
<i>until I met him.</i>

02:02.073 --> 02:04.909
You have just completed the jump,
Empire.

02:05.910 --> 02:09.204
We'll be reaching the Surah System
within a few hours.

02:24.776 --> 02:29.448
<i>I was told that the Emperor
could create or destroy worlds,</i>

02:29.531 --> 02:34.536
<i>that he had triumphed over death itself
and would live forever.</i>

02:35.704 --> 02:37.456
<i>And when I looked into his eyes…</i>

02:38.665 --> 02:43.670
<i>I saw a man who, in all his lifetimes,
had never known doubt…</i>

02:46.590 --> 02:49.676
<i>Until he encountered Hari Seldon.</i>

03:12.783 --> 03:14.409
I'm ready to review for...

03:16.745 --> 03:20.081
A moment, Empire.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.589
Even as a child,
you'd watch my preparations.

03:38.391 --> 03:40.560
Are you feeling quite well, Empire?

03:41.269 --> 03:42.646
Oh, it's just the jump.

03:44.189 --> 03:46.403
I know the Spacers
are engineered for it,

03:46.427 --> 03:48.401
but I barely consider them human.

03:50.195 --> 03:53.090
It can be disconcerting, I know.

03:54.199 --> 03:55.242
What's it like…

03:56.451 --> 03:58.120
To be awake for it?

03:58.509 --> 04:00.010
When space folds?

04:01.790 --> 04:05.085
The human mind can't tolerate
the discontinuity.

04:05.168 --> 04:06.169
But…

04:08.171 --> 04:09.422
Yours can.

04:09.506 --> 04:13.135
If I could explain it,
you wouldn't have to sleep through it.

04:20.350 --> 04:22.144
Leviathan crystal.

04:22.227 --> 04:25.981
Salt from the leviathan mines
on the Maiden.

04:26.064 --> 04:27.774
And its significance?

04:27.858 --> 04:30.485
It symbolizes the journey
of the three goddesses,

04:30.569 --> 04:32.571
Maiden, Mother and Crone.

04:32.654 --> 04:36.450
Adherents pray
by ritualistically touching it.

04:39.035 --> 04:40.871
Goes to the central theme of Luminism,

04:40.954 --> 04:44.791
cycles, ouroboros,
nature seeking completion.

04:44.875 --> 04:47.002
Mmm. Origination?

04:47.085 --> 04:50.464
Luminists believe the goddesses
were once a single entity,

04:50.547 --> 04:53.800
but when Surah collided
with the planet of…

04:56.887 --> 04:58.221
Begins with a D.

04:59.222 --> 05:00.515
- Dol.
- Mmm.

05:01.183 --> 05:04.519
It split the goddesses apart,
creating the three moons.

05:05.103 --> 05:07.689
- The only habitable moon is the Maiden.
- Mmm.

05:08.273 --> 05:09.566
Age of faith?

05:09.649 --> 05:11.777
15,000 years.

05:13.987 --> 05:15.906
Predates the Empire itself.

05:17.282 --> 05:18.867
Number of believers?

05:19.493 --> 05:20.827
Three trillion.

05:29.586 --> 05:31.004
I've never asked you,

05:32.603 --> 05:35.106
how is it that you believe?

05:36.426 --> 05:38.970
How? Or why?

05:39.220 --> 05:40.304
The latter.

05:42.432 --> 05:44.386
From the moment you come into the world,

05:44.410 --> 05:46.937
you and your brothers know your purpose.

05:47.020 --> 05:49.564
But the rest of us have to seek
these things on our own.

05:49.648 --> 05:52.734
But… you know your purpose.

05:54.152 --> 05:57.197
It's to serve my brothers, to serve me,
to serve the Empire above all.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.032
It's literally written into your code.

05:59.116 --> 06:01.827
And I am quite
fulfilled in that service.

06:02.869 --> 06:06.248
But the search for meaning
is not always about the answer.

06:06.331 --> 06:08.917
It's also the process of seeking
that enlightens.

06:10.252 --> 06:13.213
The goddesses didn't choose
to be split into three.

06:13.839 --> 06:15.674
They long to be made one again.

06:16.550 --> 06:19.803
The salty terrain of the Maiden
is said to be their tears.

06:19.886 --> 06:23.765
But it was their sacrifice that graced
the rest of us with wholeness.

06:23.849 --> 06:28.019
At every point in our lives, we have
the power to choose our own path.

06:28.103 --> 06:33.066
The goddesses guide us at every step
toward service and truth,

06:33.859 --> 06:36.361
as though toward the center
of a great spiral.

06:40.407 --> 06:44.703
And this Zephyr Halima who
challenges us, what has her path been?

06:45.245 --> 06:48.874
She hails from Mirrus Twelve,
born into the faith.

06:48.957 --> 06:52.085
After the earthquakes there,
she became a sort of a savior,

06:52.169 --> 06:53.962
spearheading the recovery effort.

06:54.045 --> 06:56.631
But she's been elevated to Zephyr
for less than a year.

06:56.715 --> 07:00.218
Ah. She's only just pulled herself
out from the rubble.

07:01.470 --> 07:03.889
Forgive me, Empire, but we have
entered the Maiden's atmosphere

07:03.972 --> 07:06.266
and will be approaching
the Salt Palace in moments.

07:30.415 --> 07:31.416
Mmm.

07:31.441 --> 07:33.484
Ready to meet the clamoring masses?

07:34.586 --> 07:37.005
I was planning on
staying aboard the ship.

07:37.088 --> 07:38.256
Why?

07:38.340 --> 07:41.301
Clearly, many on the Maiden know
I embrace their faith.

07:41.802 --> 07:44.012
This could be used to your disadvantage.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.597
Don't be ridiculous.

07:47.057 --> 07:51.394
You're my only real insight
into the Luminist beliefs.

07:55.732 --> 07:56.733
You're going.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.740
Zephyr Halima.

08:27.764 --> 08:29.891
Welcome to the Maiden, Empire.

08:31.643 --> 08:35.563
I know preparing for a formal ceremony
can be daunting,

08:36.063 --> 08:38.024
which is why I petitioned
the Ring of Zephyrs

08:38.107 --> 08:40.777
and was granted the honor
of welcoming you alone.

08:41.486 --> 08:42.571
Alone?

08:42.654 --> 08:47.177
Empire is undoubtedly accustomed
to a certain degree of pageantry,

08:47.534 --> 08:51.037
but given the somber circumstances
of the Proxima's passing,

08:51.830 --> 08:54.291
a more florid reception felt somehow…

08:55.375 --> 08:56.710
Indecorous.

08:56.793 --> 08:57.836
Of course.

08:58.920 --> 09:02.966
I want to thank you, from my heart,
for making the journey to us.

09:03.049 --> 09:07.596
Your presence speaks to how important
Luminism must be to the Empire.

09:08.180 --> 09:12.517
As a gesture of my gratitude,
I'd like to offer you a drink.

09:22.110 --> 09:25.071
The water is from the Womb
of the Mother itself.

09:25.655 --> 09:28.784
The salt from this cup is said
to draw out any impure intentions

09:28.867 --> 09:30.786
from the minds of
those who drink from it.

09:30.869 --> 09:34.919
Sadly, Empire is not able to accept
any untested potables.

09:35.011 --> 09:39.650
I'm afraid whatever impurities
I may harbor will have to remain hidden.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.756
Something tells me
that's how you'd prefer it.

09:45.092 --> 09:48.595
In any case, I look forward
to getting to know each other better.

09:49.864 --> 09:51.533
Triple blessings to you all.

10:01.608 --> 10:03.944
What is the word I'm looking for?

10:04.528 --> 10:05.529
Worthy?

10:06.321 --> 10:07.447
That will do.

10:08.990 --> 10:11.493
I don't think
she was trying to poison you.

10:11.576 --> 10:13.411
No, not literally.

10:13.495 --> 10:15.705
But I don't think anyone
with pure intentions

10:15.730 --> 10:18.608
would wheedle their way
on to my welcoming committee.

10:37.644 --> 10:38.854
Stay sharp.

10:39.438 --> 10:41.148
Our target may be armed.

10:42.482 --> 10:44.067
Or he might be dead.

10:45.152 --> 10:46.153
He's alive.

10:46.653 --> 10:49.489
Empire ships are as good
at preserving their people's lives…

10:50.031 --> 10:51.575
As they are at taking others'.

11:02.127 --> 11:04.921
Commander, you're alive
because you're useful to us.

11:06.131 --> 11:07.674
And you're already dead.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.720
You just don't know it yet.

11:11.803 --> 11:13.013
Course we know it.

11:15.515 --> 11:17.350
We're an army of ghosts.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.085
Hey. This way.

12:08.235 --> 12:10.028
You okay?

12:11.905 --> 12:13.281
Gia.

12:16.701 --> 12:17.828
What happened here?

12:20.997 --> 12:22.332
Oh, geez.

12:22.415 --> 12:24.793
It's okay. You're fine.

12:25.877 --> 12:28.630
Make for a nice story one day,
if we survive this.

12:32.968 --> 12:35.470
Now, let's get out of here
before we get shot.

12:53.697 --> 12:55.240
We have the manifest.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.617
Sort the names.

12:57.701 --> 13:02.706
I need environmental, propulsion,
and astronautics engineers.

13:03.290 --> 13:05.041
And contact Team Alder.

13:05.876 --> 13:07.794
I want the corvettes ready for launch.

13:08.336 --> 13:10.213
They're still at the caldera.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.901
Tell them to work faster.

13:13.508 --> 13:15.343
The <i>Invictus</i> won't wait forever.

13:17.053 --> 13:18.656
Why is she still alive?

13:20.807 --> 13:22.851
That vault.

13:23.268 --> 13:24.770
It's the worst kind of unknown.

13:25.645 --> 13:27.647
And she seems to be the key to it.

13:29.399 --> 13:31.151
Once we've neutralized it,

13:31.234 --> 13:32.861
we'll kill her.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.781
Are you sure this will work, Huntress?

13:36.239 --> 13:38.450
The <i>Invictus</i> is our redemption,

13:39.159 --> 13:42.287
and we have earned it with our pain.

13:58.261 --> 13:59.304
You ready?

14:10.589 --> 14:12.382
Are these the names
of your original crew?

14:13.026 --> 14:15.654
Every person who served
on the <i>Deliverance</i>.

14:16.404 --> 14:18.002
You can see we lost some people to

14:18.026 --> 14:20.826
age or accidents
when we settled Terminus.

14:21.326 --> 14:23.203
Show me the environmental engineer.

14:37.384 --> 14:38.844
Astronautics?

14:40.595 --> 14:41.721
Who was his second?

14:42.973 --> 14:45.684
I was. I took over that specialty.

14:47.269 --> 14:48.603
Propulsion?

14:50.523 --> 14:53.567
Studied at Crito Orbital Academy.

14:54.693 --> 15:00.866
Logged over 5,000 hours on
imperial transport and merchant vessels,

15:00.949 --> 15:02.451
sub-light and FTL.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.497
You're trying to crew a jumpship.

15:07.581 --> 15:09.791
So why did you shoot down
Commander Dorwin's?

15:10.375 --> 15:14.296
Because I needed the man himself,
not his little crater jumper.

15:14.379 --> 15:16.757
What you've done is an act of war.

15:17.340 --> 15:18.592
We have who we need.

15:18.675 --> 15:21.553
Restore power to the
fence and recode it.

15:21.636 --> 15:24.139
I don't want these people sneaking away
before we're done.

15:30.604 --> 15:32.689
- Hi.
- Hiya.

15:45.452 --> 15:47.370
<i>I will explain this only once.</i>

15:48.163 --> 15:50.999
The Foundation has
a breadth of knowledge we lack.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.211
And so we require a
handful of your people

15:55.003 --> 15:57.672
to assist us in repairing a starship.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.925
If the repairs go as planned,

16:00.008 --> 16:03.970
we leave Terminus, and you return
to life as you've known it.

16:04.054 --> 16:06.807
If you refuse us, then we all die,

16:07.599 --> 16:09.476
Anacreons, Terminus alike.

16:09.559 --> 16:12.020
Jacenta Rov, step forward.

16:16.858 --> 16:19.611
You were the chief environmental
engineer on the <i>Deliverance</i>?

16:19.694 --> 16:21.947
I was. But I won't work for you.

16:22.447 --> 16:24.533
My loyalty lies with the Foundation.

16:33.583 --> 16:35.544
I shot one leg.

16:35.627 --> 16:37.254
Your husband has another.

16:37.337 --> 16:39.631
Do we understand each other?

16:45.971 --> 16:47.139
Akiva Lee.

16:50.725 --> 16:53.979
Can you maintain a quantum folding
engine on an Altair-class warship?

16:55.397 --> 16:56.398
Yes.

17:03.029 --> 17:04.406
Lewis Pirenne.

17:04.489 --> 17:07.075
Please, it's been 30 years since I've...

17:14.458 --> 17:17.085
You're certain this is everyone we need?

17:23.759 --> 17:25.886
I thought you were trying to poison me.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.931
They helped, the wolvesbreath leaves.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.517
I'm less sore today.

17:32.601 --> 17:33.894
I'm glad, Empire.

17:34.728 --> 17:37.022
It would be my honor
to be of any further assistance.

17:37.105 --> 17:39.566
You can be of further assistance

17:40.150 --> 17:44.946
in accepting my regret that I
spoke to you as I did the other day.

17:51.369 --> 17:52.913
Perfect symmetry here.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.332
Hedges trimmed every day.

17:56.124 --> 17:58.877
Foolish attempt to control
the uncontrollable.

18:05.759 --> 18:08.428
A plant will grow
in the direction of light…

18:10.097 --> 18:11.098
Won't it?

18:12.182 --> 18:13.308
It will, Empire.

18:24.194 --> 18:26.446
I know I told you to get rid of those…

18:28.949 --> 18:29.950
But leave them.

18:31.159 --> 18:32.911
May the light never dim.

18:34.329 --> 18:35.539
I suspect it won't.

18:41.711 --> 18:46.049
When I summon you,
I expect you to arrive promptly.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.220
As you can see,
I have a surprise for you.

18:50.804 --> 18:53.473
A challenge on your first time out.

18:53.557 --> 18:56.810
Ghillie raptors. Now, they blend
into their surroundings so well

18:56.893 --> 18:59.604
you can hardly find them,
let alone shoot them.

19:00.230 --> 19:03.608
Look for the movement, not the color.

19:04.734 --> 19:06.866
Under normal circumstances, Brother Day

19:06.890 --> 19:08.447
would introduce you to the hunt.

19:08.530 --> 19:11.908
But since he's decided to buck tradition
and leave Trantor,

19:11.992 --> 19:14.244
that responsibility falls to me.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.288
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

19:16.872 --> 19:18.206
Neither will you.

19:18.915 --> 19:22.169
Consider it the rare opportunity

19:22.252 --> 19:25.881
for you to, uh,
exercise your independence.

19:34.639 --> 19:36.141
First one of the day.

19:36.224 --> 19:39.227
I doubt you even saw that creature
before I shot...

19:45.317 --> 19:47.194
Lucky shot.

19:47.778 --> 19:48.779
It was.

19:49.446 --> 19:52.449
Give me the day,
and I'll mold that luck into skill.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.910
I'd rather mold it myself.

19:56.036 --> 19:58.747
Well then, good hunting to you.

19:59.915 --> 20:00.957
And to you.

20:05.921 --> 20:08.715
Four moons, she's heavy.

20:08.799 --> 20:10.258
- Poly?
- Oh, shit.

20:11.510 --> 20:12.844
Damn it, Poly. That hurt.

20:12.928 --> 20:14.179
Sorry.

20:15.555 --> 20:16.556
Where are we?

20:16.640 --> 20:18.058
Geothermal tunnels.

20:18.141 --> 20:20.268
We saw you in the brig
and dragged you out here.

20:21.144 --> 20:22.938
You're way heavier than you look.

20:26.274 --> 20:27.275
Thanks.

20:29.694 --> 20:31.071
Um, Warden?

20:31.571 --> 20:32.823
What's an <i>Invictus</i>?

20:33.406 --> 20:34.658
Where'd you hear that name?

20:35.492 --> 20:37.558
Phara said it when she was with you.

20:37.582 --> 20:39.496
It was the only word I could make out.

20:39.996 --> 20:43.250
It was a legendary destroyer.
But it disappeared centuries ago.

20:43.333 --> 20:44.709
It's like a ghost ship.

20:44.793 --> 20:47.629
Well, I think Phara's found it.

20:55.637 --> 20:58.140
- On the ground. On the ground!
- Get down. Get down.

20:58.765 --> 21:01.184
- Salvor.
- Dad. Dad.

21:01.268 --> 21:03.395
- Hugo!
- Oh.

21:04.271 --> 21:06.606
- You too!
- Mayor Hardin.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.151
Thank Seldon.

21:09.234 --> 21:10.777
What are you doing here?

21:10.802 --> 21:13.096
The Anacreons recoded the fence,
locked us out.

21:13.238 --> 21:15.740
We figured the hulk was
as safe a place as any to hide.

21:15.824 --> 21:17.951
Told him it was one of the stops
on your nightly rounds.

21:18.034 --> 21:19.995
You can save all that pillow talk
for later.

21:20.078 --> 21:21.913
Right now, we need a plan
to get back inside.

21:21.997 --> 21:23.707
We're not going back.

21:23.790 --> 21:25.625
What do you mean, we're not going back?

21:28.086 --> 21:30.630
The Anacreon corvettes are
on the geothermal field.

21:30.655 --> 21:34.242
Forget the corvettes.
We need to protect the Foundation.

21:34.267 --> 21:36.770
This is about protecting the Foundation.

21:36.970 --> 21:40.807
Phara's after a warship. I... I think.
A planet-killer.

21:40.891 --> 21:42.138
If she gets her hands on it,

21:42.162 --> 21:43.852
she'll pull
the whole galaxy into conflict.

21:43.935 --> 21:46.229
This is the first Seldon Crisis.

21:46.813 --> 21:50.275
The Vault waking up now,
the instincts driving me…

21:51.985 --> 21:54.259
Hari put me here to stop the Anacreons,

21:54.283 --> 21:56.031
and he's helping me figure out how.

21:56.948 --> 21:59.951
So I'm following those instincts,

22:00.035 --> 22:02.704
and we're taking out those corvettes.
Understood?

22:04.456 --> 22:05.874
Yes, ma'am.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.876
Not you two. You're staying here.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.211
But we saved you.

22:10.253 --> 22:11.963
And I'm grateful.

22:12.047 --> 22:13.673
But this is wild work,

22:13.757 --> 22:15.675
and I'm not having
your blood on my hands.

22:28.814 --> 22:30.357
Esteemed Empire.

22:30.440 --> 22:33.860
I expected the clamoring masses
upon my arrival,

22:33.944 --> 22:36.655
but instead I'm greeted by a heretic.

22:36.738 --> 22:38.949
Profuse apologies, Empire.

22:39.032 --> 22:41.785
I assure you, a proper welcome awaits.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.956
May I present Zephyr Gilat.

22:46.873 --> 22:48.834
Triple blessings to you, Empire.

22:49.835 --> 22:51.753
The pleasure is mine, Zephyr.

22:52.254 --> 22:56.258
My condolences on the passing
of Proxima Opal.

22:56.341 --> 23:00.696
Thank you, Empire. It is a sad occasion,
but also a hopeful one.

23:00.779 --> 23:02.055
Especially for you.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.583
I shall gracefully accept whatever
the Ring of Zephyrs should decide.

23:05.608 --> 23:07.777
Tell us, what is your sense
of how they currently lean?

23:07.978 --> 23:11.207
Zephyr Gilat is still most likely
to be named Proxima.

23:11.233 --> 23:12.301
However,

23:12.325 --> 23:16.194
it will not take much to tip
things in a less desirable fashion.

23:16.219 --> 23:17.220
I understand.

23:19.030 --> 23:21.741
We want to help you
in whatever way we can.

23:21.825 --> 23:23.660
That is most generous.

23:23.743 --> 23:27.998
We cannot deny that Halima has
a natural charisma.

23:28.790 --> 23:32.335
I feel it is necessary for me
to offer something concrete.

23:32.419 --> 23:37.340
With all due respect, Empire,
the infrastructure's crumbling.

23:37.424 --> 23:40.719
Fresh water has long been expensive
and hard to come by.

23:40.802 --> 23:44.598
Something in this Halima
is quenching their thirst.

23:44.681 --> 23:46.933
I think we have a solution for that.

23:47.017 --> 23:51.104
We'll take Halima's metaphor
and make it literal.

23:55.734 --> 24:00.781
Zephyr Gilat, in honor of your rising
as the next Proxima,

24:00.864 --> 24:04.367
Empire will build a moon-wide
desalination system.

24:04.951 --> 24:08.997
Your people will never go
without clean drinking water again.

24:13.585 --> 24:16.505
I am without words, Empire.

24:17.798 --> 24:21.093
Triple blessings to you, Zephyr Gilat.

24:39.152 --> 24:40.153
You okay?

24:40.862 --> 24:43.198
I was not cut out for this wind.

24:43.782 --> 24:46.618
I spent those first years
with my fists clenched.

24:47.178 --> 24:48.345
One day your mother said,

24:48.370 --> 24:50.747
"Open your fists, man.
You can't punch the wind."

24:50.831 --> 24:53.083
You go on, Hugo. We'll catch up.

24:56.711 --> 25:00.924
Growing up on Trantor,
childhood indoors…

25:02.551 --> 25:03.802
Makes you soft.

25:05.178 --> 25:07.556
You never, uh, talk much about Trantor.

25:08.765 --> 25:09.933
What's the point?

25:10.809 --> 25:12.602
We're never going back there.

25:12.686 --> 25:13.937
Was it bad?

25:14.688 --> 25:17.524
On the contrary. It was incredible.

25:17.607 --> 25:21.445
Your grandparents worked the Star
Bridge, so we were pretty well-off.

25:22.070 --> 25:23.488
Miracles everywhere.

25:24.489 --> 25:26.616
Floating fountains,

25:26.700 --> 25:29.619
synchronized water shows with whales

25:29.703 --> 25:32.581
and things swimming
above your head in zero G.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.125
And the food... Oh, my God.

25:35.208 --> 25:37.419
The finest everything.

25:38.044 --> 25:40.046
You think I'm fat now?

25:41.778 --> 25:43.321
But here's the thing, Sal.

25:45.510 --> 25:51.516
We knew it was built
on a mountain of lies and deception,

25:52.476 --> 25:55.061
a trillion people working
behind the scenes

25:55.145 --> 25:56.605
just to make everything shine.

25:56.688 --> 25:59.691
You scratch the surface of it,
and it just couldn't go on.

26:00.942 --> 26:03.779
And then Hari started making waves
about the collapse.

26:03.862 --> 26:07.407
You know, I couldn't make heads or tails
of anything he was saying.

26:07.491 --> 26:09.534
But you believed in the Plan.

26:09.618 --> 26:13.288
I believed in a girl named Mari Hardin,

26:13.371 --> 26:15.999
who I desperately wanted
to go to bed with.

26:16.082 --> 26:18.668
Dad.

26:19.419 --> 26:21.755
She believed in the Plan.

26:21.838 --> 26:23.757
You joined the Foundation for a girl?

26:23.840 --> 26:25.300
I did.

26:25.383 --> 26:27.928
Do you ever regret it? Coming here?

26:32.224 --> 26:34.226
I got you out of it, didn't I?

26:35.185 --> 26:36.186
Come on.

27:00.669 --> 27:02.170
That does not look good.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.263
They're setting charges
around the hydro-cells.

27:11.346 --> 27:12.889
It'll destroy the entire city.

27:13.682 --> 27:15.976
We need to throw a very large wrench
into the works.

27:18.770 --> 27:21.982
If I could get closer, I could snipe
one of those explosive disks,

27:22.482 --> 27:24.568
maybe take out a corvette or two.

27:26.736 --> 27:29.406
A better shot could keep her distance
and take out all three.

27:29.489 --> 27:30.574
Oh, Salvor.

27:30.657 --> 27:32.409
No. Nothing doing, Dad.

27:32.492 --> 27:34.619
You're too old, too fat,
and your eyesight's for shit.

27:34.703 --> 27:35.829
You'll never make it.

27:36.830 --> 27:39.207
You are definitely
your mother's daughter.

27:53.096 --> 27:55.599
Your focus and skill
are extraordinary, Empire.

27:56.349 --> 27:57.768
Six kills.

27:57.851 --> 28:01.688
Brother Dusk will be impressed.
You've broken his record.

28:01.772 --> 28:03.106
How many did he kill?

28:03.190 --> 28:04.900
On his best hunt, three.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.651
And after a good deal of practice.

28:07.235 --> 28:09.946
Ah, sneaky bastard.

28:10.030 --> 28:12.741
That would have made four.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.994
Throw these into the bushes.
Take them now. I killed three.

28:16.870 --> 28:18.872
I killed three. Do you understand? Go!

28:22.876 --> 28:25.587
Brother Dawn, how was your hunt?

28:25.670 --> 28:27.547
Ooh, three.

28:27.631 --> 28:30.258
You matched my record
on your first attempt.

28:30.342 --> 28:31.885
Romus helped considerably.

28:32.853 --> 28:34.262
Exceptional work, Brother Dawn.

28:34.287 --> 28:35.997
You're a natural hunter.

28:36.556 --> 28:37.682
Here, to celebrate.

28:45.440 --> 28:49.528
Well, you hunt like a man.
Do you consider yourself a man now?

28:50.487 --> 28:52.739
I don't know. I suppose?

28:52.823 --> 28:56.284
Only a man can replace the man.

28:58.578 --> 29:01.790
I think it's time you paid a visit
to Gossamer Court.

29:03.625 --> 29:07.587
The business of Empire is challenging.

29:07.671 --> 29:09.965
And we are human, after all.

29:10.048 --> 29:15.303
We need to voice our fears,
our hatreds, our resentments.

29:15.929 --> 29:18.765
Their memories are wiped clean
before they leave Trantor.

29:18.849 --> 29:21.768
Cleon I developed the system.

29:21.852 --> 29:23.103
It's perfect, really.

29:24.104 --> 29:25.105
So?

29:27.649 --> 29:29.151
Which one would you like?

29:33.780 --> 29:36.491
What pleasures do you seek, Empire?

29:36.575 --> 29:38.368
You'll have no memory of this?

29:40.078 --> 29:42.330
None that will endure
past the night, Empire.

29:43.415 --> 29:46.793
I could say anything to you,

29:47.544 --> 29:49.045
and you won't remember tomorrow?

29:49.129 --> 29:50.297
That's correct.

29:51.006 --> 29:52.674
And that doesn't bother you?

29:53.675 --> 29:55.802
Memories of this liaison are not
my possession.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.138
They belong to Empire.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.544
Do you care for the
pleasure of discourse?

30:07.568 --> 30:09.649
I'm conversant in many subjects.

30:24.748 --> 30:25.791
Turn away.

30:39.888 --> 30:41.556
I'll tell them you did well.

30:43.600 --> 30:47.145
And as far as you'll remember, you did.

30:48.939 --> 30:50.482
<i>He didn't touch me.</i>

30:51.483 --> 30:52.943
What did he do then?

30:54.903 --> 30:55.987
He just talked.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.492
Tell me everything he said.

31:10.919 --> 31:12.170
You good, Sal?

31:12.754 --> 31:14.089
Almost in range now.

31:14.172 --> 31:16.425
Just need to take a wind reading
and I'm good to go.

31:36.319 --> 31:38.196
Salvor? Sal?

31:39.698 --> 31:41.116
- It's happened again.
- What?

31:41.199 --> 31:43.410
It's a mind-slip, seizure, something.

31:44.244 --> 31:46.371
If we don't pull her back,
they'll spot her.

31:46.455 --> 31:49.791
You get Salvor. I'll get the corvettes.

31:54.087 --> 31:55.714
There's only one scenario

31:55.738 --> 31:57.549
in which you leave the ship as planned,

31:57.574 --> 31:59.884
and that's the one in which it becomes
impossible

31:59.908 --> 32:01.995
for you to remain on board.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.222
I don't take my life.

32:06.558 --> 32:07.601
You do.

32:08.602 --> 32:11.021
<i>You're Hari Seldon. You can fix this.</i>

32:11.104 --> 32:12.898
I'm telling you I can't.

32:12.981 --> 32:14.316
Don't you see?

32:14.399 --> 32:20.280
This whole thing collapses
because you stay with her.

32:21.114 --> 32:25.243
And everything everyone has sacrificed,
all wasted.

32:25.952 --> 32:28.163
You know what I'm saying is true.

32:29.456 --> 32:30.791
Do you trust the math?

32:31.875 --> 32:33.043
I hate the math.

32:33.835 --> 32:35.128
Do you trust me?

32:35.629 --> 32:37.422
I wish I'd never met you,

32:37.923 --> 32:39.966
never stolen your damn books.

32:41.051 --> 32:42.135
But you did.

32:42.969 --> 32:45.097
And we are here now,

32:45.764 --> 32:50.560
an entire galaxy pivoting around
the actions of an individual. You.

32:58.193 --> 33:01.696
Go straight to the cryo-pod.
It's programmed for you.

33:01.780 --> 33:04.241
And don't stop to say goodbye to her.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.410
Don't implicate her in this.

33:28.473 --> 33:30.517
<i>Salvor?</i>

33:32.018 --> 33:34.646
- It happened again.
- I know. Can you shoot?

33:34.729 --> 33:36.565
- Yeah.
- Then go. Go.

34:02.466 --> 34:04.134
Where's my dad?

34:04.217 --> 34:06.678
Gone for the corvettes.
He went in after you dropped.

34:09.097 --> 34:10.474
He won't make it.

34:16.646 --> 34:18.148
There are too many.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.638
Keep covering me, Sal.
I'll take out those ships.

34:49.720 --> 34:51.515
No, Dad. No.

35:12.369 --> 35:13.870
Help!

35:15.205 --> 35:16.206
Dad!

35:22.546 --> 35:24.881
Salvor Hardin, Warden of Terminus.

35:24.965 --> 35:27.968
- Dad.
- You have to protect the Plan.

35:28.051 --> 35:29.594
Dad, please.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.249
Open your fists, Salvor.

36:03.503 --> 36:04.921
No, Daddy!

36:05.005 --> 36:06.715
Don't fight the wind.

36:12.637 --> 36:14.848
Daddy!

36:16.057 --> 36:17.058
No.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.645
No.

36:40.665 --> 36:42.793
You should see the view from up here.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.218
Empire, I... I shouldn't be here.

36:53.804 --> 36:55.931
Come. It's all right.

37:07.943 --> 37:09.277
Thought you might like that.

37:25.585 --> 37:26.670
Parterres.

37:28.797 --> 37:29.840
Walkways.

37:31.550 --> 37:32.592
Grand lawn.

37:35.011 --> 37:38.348
Look how precise they are, how neat.

37:39.349 --> 37:40.934
Everything in its place.

37:43.728 --> 37:44.938
I've always loved that.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.693
Come see it from here.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.661
I don't have a force field, Empire.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.165
You do now.

38:18.638 --> 38:19.723
Take it.

38:22.434 --> 38:23.560
I won't if you're not.

38:32.486 --> 38:33.695
It's beautiful.

38:36.031 --> 38:38.033
If you can see beauty, it is.

38:39.910 --> 38:41.203
Tell me what those are.

38:44.414 --> 38:45.582
The rose garden?

38:46.875 --> 38:49.628
<i>Rosa arvensis,</i> then <i>Rosa persica.</i>

38:49.711 --> 38:52.088
<i>- Rosa kordesii...</i>
- Uh, their colors.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.424
White and yellow.

38:55.258 --> 38:57.552
A bright yellow with a dark red center,

38:59.054 --> 39:01.181
and a deep, brilliant red.

39:01.264 --> 39:03.767
What else is that color? That red.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.228
In nature?

39:07.062 --> 39:08.688
The scarlet maple tree.

39:09.731 --> 39:11.399
The summer tanager bird.

39:12.192 --> 39:13.902
The shell of the red crab.

39:14.694 --> 39:16.029
Red sandalwood.

39:20.617 --> 39:22.828
I wasn't aware Empire was color-blind.

39:24.579 --> 39:26.039
Empire isn't.

39:26.123 --> 39:28.166
Cleons are exact replicas.

39:29.084 --> 39:31.128
None has ever been color-blind…

39:34.089 --> 39:35.090
Before me.

39:36.383 --> 39:37.843
Isn't it fairly common in men?

39:39.261 --> 39:40.929
There are simple ways to correct it.

39:41.012 --> 39:42.347
It's not common to us.

39:44.766 --> 39:46.184
And none of it's simple.

39:47.936 --> 39:49.146
That's my secret.

39:51.815 --> 39:53.066
And now you know it.

39:55.986 --> 39:57.237
Now what do I do?

40:09.583 --> 40:11.856
If I were trying to keep a secret,

40:11.880 --> 40:13.336
I'd push me off.

40:13.572 --> 40:16.074
It's the safest way
to ensure my silence.

40:24.765 --> 40:25.849
You could push me.

41:38.338 --> 41:39.589
Sal.

41:42.008 --> 41:44.010
He joined the Foundation for a girl.

41:48.306 --> 41:49.474
Isn't that strange?

41:51.601 --> 41:53.395
He believed in the end, but…

41:55.522 --> 41:57.274
He did it all for my mom.

42:02.237 --> 42:03.530
I'm so sorry.

42:12.372 --> 42:14.040
I screwed up, Hugo.

42:15.667 --> 42:18.336
If I hadn't blacked out,
my father would still be alive.

42:18.420 --> 42:20.380
No.

42:20.464 --> 42:24.384
I was... I was just so certain
taking their ships was the right play.

42:24.409 --> 42:25.618
Maybe it was.

42:26.428 --> 42:28.054
Maybe the other plays were worse.

42:30.056 --> 42:33.226
And Hari said...
He said an entire galaxy can pivot

42:33.310 --> 42:35.353
around the actions of an individual.

42:35.937 --> 42:38.064
So then you are
one of those individuals, right?

42:38.690 --> 42:40.817
Hari is guiding you
to keep the Plan on course.

42:42.444 --> 42:45.614
Because I'm, what? Special?

42:47.240 --> 42:50.076
The Anacreons took the city
because of me...

42:50.160 --> 42:54.222
No. They took it because of Lewis
and the idiots in the tower.

42:55.749 --> 42:57.918
And right now
the only chance the Foundation has

42:57.943 --> 43:00.070
of surviving this crisis is you.

43:01.838 --> 43:03.465
I don't care about the crisis.

43:04.382 --> 43:06.426
All I care about is making Phara pay.

43:08.136 --> 43:09.471
We just blew up her ships.

43:09.554 --> 43:11.431
Your rig's the only way off planet now.

43:11.515 --> 43:14.518
We get to the <i>Beggar</i> before they do,
they are stranded. Come on.

43:24.486 --> 43:29.116
As we mourn Proxima Opal's
compassion and her strength,

43:29.699 --> 43:32.343
let us be grateful for
her many blessings.

43:33.161 --> 43:36.248
In honor of Opal's passage to rebirth,

43:36.331 --> 43:40.043
and as a gesture of faith
to our next Proxima,

43:40.127 --> 43:47.316
our esteemed Empire will be installing
a moon-wide desalination system.

43:51.638 --> 43:54.224
Let us now praise Empire

43:54.307 --> 43:58.311
and turn to the words of the New Octavo.

44:01.106 --> 44:03.650
"With the gifts of our protectors…

44:05.527 --> 44:06.695
Our hearts…

44:11.158 --> 44:15.996
Our hearts are multiplied
and our spirits emboldened.

44:16.079 --> 44:20.083
By the will of their souls
aligned with ours"...

44:23.378 --> 44:24.504
..."our path"...

44:33.722 --> 44:36.349
Zephyr Gilat speaks holy words,

44:37.476 --> 44:39.144
and we thank her for them.

44:42.856 --> 44:45.400
We extend our gratitude to the Empire.

44:46.109 --> 44:50.155
As we celebrate Proxima Opal's
passage to her next life,

44:51.114 --> 44:54.910
let us take a moment to be grateful
for the Mother's gift,

44:55.952 --> 44:58.246
the gift of rebirth.

45:00.749 --> 45:03.794
There was a time, millennia ago,

45:04.920 --> 45:07.631
when our souls were like wax candles.

45:07.714 --> 45:10.467
They burned through once,
and then they were snuffed out.

45:11.384 --> 45:14.846
But the Mother looked down
and saw that this was insufficient.

45:15.889 --> 45:19.059
A single life in a single body,

45:20.060 --> 45:22.270
raised in a single world,

45:23.522 --> 45:29.361
such a soul had no foothold to climb
from the trenches of ignorance

45:30.028 --> 45:32.155
to grow into holiness.

45:33.156 --> 45:37.285
And so the Mother took
that straight line of life

45:37.369 --> 45:39.788
and shaped it into a circle,

45:40.413 --> 45:43.583
bestowing upon us the gift of rebirth.

45:45.001 --> 45:46.711
But what does this gift mean?

45:47.212 --> 45:49.881
Some believe the
purpose of reincarnation

45:49.965 --> 45:53.635
is to ascend to the highest planes
of enlightenment.

45:55.178 --> 45:56.972
But we know better, don't we?

45:57.055 --> 46:00.225
For there is no end to this journey.

46:01.017 --> 46:03.353
For our capacity for growth

46:04.604 --> 46:06.273
is infinite.

46:07.691 --> 46:11.987
Even a soul that appeared holy
400 years ago

46:13.196 --> 46:15.991
would not be holy today.

46:17.409 --> 46:19.911
This is the Mother's lesson.

46:20.495 --> 46:23.081
As the galaxy changes, so must we.

46:23.748 --> 46:27.961
We must embrace
the value of transformation,

46:28.044 --> 46:29.671
of evolution,

46:30.714 --> 46:32.382
of difference.

46:32.466 --> 46:35.343
The greatest failure of humanity,

46:35.427 --> 46:39.222
the greatest sin against the Mother,
is stagnation.

46:40.724 --> 46:42.559
And so we rejoice

46:43.351 --> 46:48.442
that Proxima Opal's soul will not
stagnate and rust into corruption.

46:49.699 --> 46:55.004
We rejoice that her soul is not bound
to a single, immutable body.

46:56.019 --> 47:00.792
We rejoice that her soul is
an ever-transformative, evolving soul.

47:06.708 --> 47:09.419
Our lives in these bodies may be brief…

47:11.213 --> 47:14.132
But our souls are endless.

47:14.216 --> 47:16.645
And as we shape and sculpt our souls

47:16.669 --> 47:19.513
into a never-ending quest for holiness,

47:19.538 --> 47:20.664
remember this.

47:21.723 --> 47:27.521
This will not always be your life.
But it is your life now.

47:28.230 --> 47:30.774
Your choice now.

47:31.817 --> 47:34.945
Your change now.

47:35.904 --> 47:37.280
Make it count!

47:41.451 --> 47:42.661
To the Mother!

47:42.744 --> 47:44.162
To the Mother!

48:28.540 --> 48:29.541
Let's go.

48:50.896 --> 48:52.189
Kill her.

48:52.272 --> 48:53.982
<i>Beggar,</i> invoke protocol.

48:54.065 --> 48:56.401
Ship transfer Salvor Hardin. Lock.

48:59.446 --> 49:01.198
What the hell did you just do?

49:01.823 --> 49:03.658
I slaved the ship to Salvor.

49:03.742 --> 49:06.328
From now on, it won't do anything
without her authorization.

49:06.411 --> 49:09.790
Change it back. Make her change it back!

49:10.259 --> 49:12.428
I locked it. Can't be changed.

49:12.626 --> 49:15.962
So now you're stuck here
until the Empire arrives in full force.

49:16.046 --> 49:18.256
Reprogram it now.

49:18.340 --> 49:20.342
It won't listen to me.

49:20.425 --> 49:23.011
Thespin ships only recognize
one captain at a time.

49:23.762 --> 49:25.514
From now on, that's her.

49:25.597 --> 49:27.891
So whatever bullshit
it is you're planning,

49:28.850 --> 49:30.644
you won't be able to do it without her.

49:31.895 --> 49:32.938
Then I can kill you.

49:33.021 --> 49:36.149
Don't be an idiot. I don't know
the first thing about piloting a ship.

49:36.983 --> 49:39.027
I need him riding shotgun.

49:39.111 --> 49:40.362
You need him.

49:51.331 --> 49:54.835
Guess you get to see
the stars after all, Warden.

50:04.970 --> 50:07.431
You have space suits here?

50:07.514 --> 50:09.224
From your time on the <i>Deliverance</i>?

50:09.307 --> 50:11.560
Yes, but they're 30 years old.

50:11.643 --> 50:12.853
They'll have to do.

50:15.939 --> 50:17.649
Understand me.

50:17.732 --> 50:21.236
We are leaving the rest of our troops
here as leverage.

50:21.319 --> 50:26.340
If you fail to follow our orders,
if you defy our Huntress in any way,

50:27.617 --> 50:31.872
weigh your fate against those
of your loved ones and act accordingly.

50:34.583 --> 50:36.126
- Lewis.
- Dara.

50:42.466 --> 50:45.302
It's all right, my love.
Just do whatever they ask.

50:45.385 --> 50:48.096
Please, don't do...

50:48.180 --> 50:49.222
Please.

50:49.306 --> 50:52.184
Get off. Let go.

50:54.227 --> 50:56.062
Mommy!

51:04.083 --> 51:05.292
Where's your father?

51:08.867 --> 51:09.951
Where's Abbas?

51:12.245 --> 51:16.082
Mom, I'm so sorry. I tried. I tried.

51:56.832 --> 51:58.041
Take us up there.

51:58.066 --> 52:00.693
Like I said, it's Salvor's ship now.

52:03.922 --> 52:05.841
Just grab the controls
and trust yourself.

52:06.758 --> 52:07.843
I got it.

52:10.929 --> 52:13.056
<i>Please enter your destination.</i>

52:13.849 --> 52:15.809
The ship's asking for coordinates.

52:15.892 --> 52:17.477
You wanna tell us where we're going?

52:18.061 --> 52:19.312
The Anthor Belt.

52:21.398 --> 52:23.400
Strap in. Takeoffs can be rough.

52:23.483 --> 52:24.526
I'm happy here.

52:27.112 --> 52:29.197
The Belt's coordinates are stored
in the <i>Beggar's</i> nav

52:29.281 --> 52:30.866
from when I used to do mining runs.

52:31.533 --> 52:33.577
Get us out of the atmosphere,
and we'll be fine.

52:50.051 --> 52:51.094
We're ready.

52:51.178 --> 52:52.262
And engines.

53:05.233 --> 53:06.401
Easy.

53:16.077 --> 53:17.370
Are we okay?

53:18.914 --> 53:21.249
Let the stick tell you
what the ship wants to do.

53:21.333 --> 53:23.877
You're not controlling it.
It's a cooperation.

53:23.960 --> 53:26.922
If I'm not controlling it,
then they shouldn't call them controls.

53:32.052 --> 53:34.596
Increase thrust 20%.
Compensate for the eastern wind shear.

53:36.807 --> 53:37.933
Boosters increased.

53:43.605 --> 53:46.104
Good job. We're out of the woods.

53:48.193 --> 53:49.526
Crowns.
