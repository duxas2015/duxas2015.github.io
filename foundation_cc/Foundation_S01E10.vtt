00:14.641 --> 00:17.204
<i>My mother
used to say that going to sleep</i>

00:17.228 --> 00:19.312
<i>was a leap of faith.</i>

00:22.149 --> 00:26.111
<i>Our souls wander when we dream,
or so she told me.</i>

00:30.866 --> 00:32.993
<i>And if we say our devotions,</i>

00:34.077 --> 00:37.247
<i>our souls will find their way back
before we wake.</i>

00:41.668 --> 00:44.379
<i>Climbing from our
cradle is another leap.</i>

00:46.214 --> 00:48.133
<i>So is leaving the comfort of home.</i>

00:51.762 --> 00:56.683
<i>For some, it's setting sail,
hurtling ourselves into the void.</i>

00:58.769 --> 01:04.190
<i>We send messages into space
hoping someone will answer,</i>

01:05.317 --> 01:09.488
<i>praying we find safe harbor
over the horizon.</i>

01:35.847 --> 01:38.141
Anacreon and Thespis,

01:38.225 --> 01:41.186
you've been at each other's throats
so long,

01:41.853 --> 01:45.565
the origin of your enmity is
almost irrelevant.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.110
We have legitimate
grounds for our hatred.

01:48.193 --> 01:51.363
The First Betrayal
and a thousand atrocities since.

01:51.446 --> 01:53.448
No one knows
what really happened that night.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.701
The First Betrayal.

01:57.285 --> 02:01.665
A Thespin king newly wed
to an Anacreon huntress.

02:02.624 --> 02:06.503
The two emerging powers
of the Outer Reach united in marriage.

02:06.586 --> 02:09.088
Are you gonna teach us
our own history now, dead man? Huh?

02:09.171 --> 02:11.633
The Thespin dog slit her throat
on their wedding bed.

02:12.426 --> 02:13.802
So the legend goes.

02:13.885 --> 02:16.096
Are you suggesting our history's wrong?

02:16.179 --> 02:18.627
History is written by the victor,

02:18.651 --> 02:21.768
and neither of you seem to be winning.

02:21.852 --> 02:23.311
There was a witness.

02:23.395 --> 02:26.606
The only witness,
an Anacreon handmaid who testified

02:26.690 --> 02:30.110
that King Throy un Thark got drunk
the night of the wedding

02:30.902 --> 02:34.614
and, in a fit of rage,
murdered your huntress.

02:34.698 --> 02:36.408
The handmaid lied.

02:36.491 --> 02:39.077
The nature of the lie is relevant here.

02:39.953 --> 02:43.415
On her deathbed,
the handmaid made a confession.

02:44.124 --> 02:47.961
The real murderer was Cleon II.

02:48.545 --> 02:51.506
The first clone
in the Genetic Dynasty realized

02:51.590 --> 02:54.676
that a plan could unfold
over several lifetimes.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.095
He saw where this
new alliance could lead,

02:57.179 --> 03:03.226
so he had his shadowmaster seduce
the handmaiden, drug the newlyweds,

03:03.310 --> 03:06.897
murder your huntress
and implicate your king.

03:07.564 --> 03:10.025
Why fight two upstart kingdoms

03:10.108 --> 03:12.931
when you can exploit their racial animus

03:12.955 --> 03:14.863
and have them fight each other?

03:16.615 --> 03:18.450
The clones played you.

03:19.326 --> 03:22.662
But today, thanks to the Foundation,

03:23.163 --> 03:27.334
we could put back together
what Empire has broken.

03:27.417 --> 03:32.005
No. We are not uniting with them now,
no matter how this started.

03:32.089 --> 03:35.092
And even if we did,
Empire is too strong.

03:35.175 --> 03:36.843
Now you have the <i>Invictus</i>.

03:36.927 --> 03:39.054
The <i>Invictus</i> is only one ship.

03:39.137 --> 03:41.640
One ship can be the first of many.

03:41.723 --> 03:46.561
If both your peoples will set
aside hatred in favor of strength,

03:47.187 --> 03:48.897
as those poor newlyweds did,

03:48.980 --> 03:53.944
then you'll find here the skills
necessary to build more ships.

03:54.569 --> 03:58.115
For the Plan to succeed,
the Foundation needs three pillars,

03:58.198 --> 04:00.951
just as a stool needs three legs.

04:01.034 --> 04:03.537
It needs all the children
of the Outer Reach.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.122
That is the way I designed it.

04:05.205 --> 04:09.084
So, Hari, you knew
the <i>Invictus</i> would be discovered?

04:09.584 --> 04:13.338
Hello, Mari. Good to see you again.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.382
Where's Gaal?

04:16.466 --> 04:18.300
She never made it to Terminus.

04:19.469 --> 04:20.804
And you are?

04:22.764 --> 04:23.849
Salvor Hardin.

04:25.058 --> 04:26.143
Mari's daughter.

04:27.394 --> 04:29.271
I'm the one who opened the Vault

04:29.354 --> 04:31.857
and who wrestled that damn ship
onto our doorstep.

04:32.357 --> 04:36.695
Well, Salvor Hardin,
it appears thanks are in order.

04:37.362 --> 04:39.543
As to the mystery of the <i>Invictus,</i>

04:39.626 --> 04:41.574
its appearances were one of the first
tests

04:41.598 --> 04:43.410
I gave my predictive models.

04:43.910 --> 04:48.331
Where others saw chaos,
I found a pattern.

04:48.957 --> 04:52.627
I don't understand.
We're not revolutionaries.

04:52.711 --> 04:54.296
You said so yourself at the trial.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.257
Well, I might have lied about that.

05:16.067 --> 05:18.153
I am grateful, Brother Dusk.

05:18.236 --> 05:21.907
That I saved our dynasty
from infiltration?

05:21.990 --> 05:23.436
I wonder, Day,

05:23.460 --> 05:26.453
if you'd stayed on Trantor
and not traveled to the Maiden,

05:27.245 --> 05:29.372
would you have apprehended
his differences?

05:30.707 --> 05:35.504
You and I are the same.
I have to believe I would have.

05:37.839 --> 05:40.842
The more important question is
what do we do now?

05:42.344 --> 05:44.054
You know what we have to do.

05:59.653 --> 06:00.654
Out.

06:05.742 --> 06:07.869
We're still unraveling
the exact methodology,

06:07.953 --> 06:12.082
but apparently they corrupted
your nanoparticle regimen some time ago.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.459
You're not one of us.

06:16.044 --> 06:18.672
Your DNA has been
altered in a dozen ways.

06:19.172 --> 06:20.590
You look like us.

06:23.093 --> 06:24.803
You sound like us, but…

06:31.476 --> 06:33.228
How long have you known?

06:33.311 --> 06:34.688
That I'm different?

06:37.190 --> 06:39.359
I used to steal away
and watch holos of you…

06:41.736 --> 06:42.904
Eating breakfast,

06:44.322 --> 06:45.782
sitting in the throne room.

06:46.283 --> 06:49.286
I counted how often you smiled
at your subjects,

06:49.953 --> 06:53.206
whether you sat
with your hands together or apart,

06:53.290 --> 06:55.375
how often you drank from your cup
at meals.

06:55.876 --> 06:58.128
I knew even then that I wasn't like you.

07:00.088 --> 07:01.339
But I wanted to be.

07:12.267 --> 07:13.518
What are you going to do?

07:13.602 --> 07:15.645
You conspired with insurgents.

07:15.729 --> 07:17.147
I wasn't conspiring.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.775
You trusted your secrets to our enemies
and fled the palace.

07:19.858 --> 07:21.512
- She tricked me!
- Because she had a foothold

07:21.536 --> 07:23.945
- in your heart!
- And who created that foothold?

07:24.571 --> 07:25.572
Look at us!

07:26.156 --> 07:28.825
We have no mothers, no aunts, no uncles.

07:28.909 --> 07:30.410
We have sex with concubines

07:30.494 --> 07:32.704
whose memories are erased
the moment we leave them!

07:33.789 --> 07:35.916
Have you never longed
to leave this place?

07:37.584 --> 07:41.421
Have you never felt stifled
by the weight of our ascendants?

07:43.215 --> 07:46.635
Can you truly say that
all you've ever wanted

07:46.718 --> 07:51.765
was to be an installment
in a long, long line of us,

07:53.225 --> 07:55.727
living out a script
written centuries ago?

08:00.190 --> 08:03.485
All my life,
I've wanted to call you "Father."

08:04.611 --> 08:06.113
But you're not my father.

08:07.656 --> 08:09.491
We're not even people, Day.

08:11.034 --> 08:16.123
We're just… echoes of the first Cleon.

08:18.917 --> 08:22.129
So is a corrupted echo
more original than a perfect one?

08:24.297 --> 08:26.383
Or does it fade away to nothing?

08:34.975 --> 08:38.019
So the curation,
everything we've been doing here,

08:38.102 --> 08:39.270
has all been for nothing?

08:39.354 --> 08:41.148
Not for nothing, Mari.

08:41.731 --> 08:44.192
Your time here on Terminus
hasn't been wasted.

08:44.901 --> 08:46.862
It got you out
from under the Empire's grasp.

08:46.945 --> 08:47.946
It hardened you.

08:48.029 --> 08:52.075
But the Foundation was never
about curating knowledge.

08:53.952 --> 08:55.787
It was about curating people.

08:58.957 --> 09:01.501
You, the original settlers,

09:02.043 --> 09:07.132
you possess qualities vital in forming
the seeds of a new civilization.

09:07.883 --> 09:12.554
And you, Anacreons and Thespins,
you are the consummate survivors.

09:13.221 --> 09:16.266
Consigned to history
by the Empire and yet,

09:17.309 --> 09:20.520
together, you represent the future.

09:21.646 --> 09:24.900
The human race is an ever-evolving story

09:24.983 --> 09:29.446
told over thousands of years
by a countless number of voices.

09:30.739 --> 09:31.948
But for a long time now,

09:32.032 --> 09:36.161
that chorus has been
suffocated and quietly erased.

09:36.745 --> 09:41.082
Because under the Genetic Dynasty,
there is only room for one story.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.501
One voice.

09:42.584 --> 09:44.579
We cannot become who we must become

09:44.603 --> 09:46.505
if the Empire is allowed to persist.

09:48.090 --> 09:51.468
That path leads to
the annihilation of the human race.

09:51.903 --> 09:54.791
Even if we embrace
this destiny of yours,

09:54.815 --> 09:57.140
the Empire will be here within weeks.

09:57.224 --> 10:00.685
He's right. They were already
investigating the comms buoy.

10:00.769 --> 10:03.396
It's only a matter of time
before they send reinforcements.

10:03.480 --> 10:08.735
The Empire won't come. Not yet.
Not if they think you're already dead.

10:09.236 --> 10:12.531
Take the <i>Invictus</i>
to the far side of your star,

10:12.614 --> 10:14.685
activate the quantum drive,

10:14.709 --> 10:17.285
but maintain your
position in subspace...

10:17.369 --> 10:19.746
The energy signature would read
as a mega-flare.

10:21.248 --> 10:23.208
A mega-flare would wipe out
all life in the system.

10:23.291 --> 10:26.461
The Empire comprises
tens of thousands of worlds.

10:26.545 --> 10:29.798
A dangerous star with dead planets
in a distant arm of the galaxy

10:29.881 --> 10:31.549
won't merit further investigation

10:31.573 --> 10:34.052
even if it did once host the Foundation.

10:34.641 --> 10:37.102
It could work. It could.

10:37.815 --> 10:40.026
As long as don't we stray
beyond the Outer Reach,

10:40.934 --> 10:42.310
we'd be invisible to them.

10:42.394 --> 10:43.562
We'd be free.

10:43.645 --> 10:44.938
You'd be free,

10:45.772 --> 10:50.026
to bide your time, to build,
to become who you need to become.

10:51.945 --> 10:53.655
So, are you the ghost then?

10:54.906 --> 10:56.116
I suppose I am.

10:56.199 --> 10:57.868
- What's it like to die?
- Keir.

10:57.951 --> 10:59.202
What? I want to know.

11:02.664 --> 11:03.957
Did you see anything?

11:05.667 --> 11:07.794
Those are complex questions.

11:07.878 --> 11:11.673
Then answer a simple one.
How'd you get here?

11:12.632 --> 11:14.092
What's your name, son?

11:14.176 --> 11:16.595
Poly. Poly Verisof.

11:16.678 --> 11:20.849
Well, Poly Verisof,
shortly before I died,

11:21.516 --> 11:22.978
I swallowed a pill

11:23.002 --> 11:26.855
containing millions
of self-replicating molecular machines.

11:27.564 --> 11:31.568
As per my mortality directive,
my casket was jettisoned out into space.

11:32.360 --> 11:35.197
<i>Those machines began breaking down
my body tissue</i>

11:35.280 --> 11:37.824
<i>into all its constituent elements.</i>

11:37.908 --> 11:40.494
Then those machines recycled
those elements,

11:40.577 --> 11:44.247
scooping up more material, ice,
micrometeoroids, et cetera,

11:44.331 --> 11:47.083
assembling
the Vault's internal scaffolding.

11:47.751 --> 11:49.753
You're saying
the Vault isn't just your tomb?

11:50.921 --> 11:52.422
The Vault is you?

11:52.923 --> 11:55.926
You've been on Terminus this whole time,
watching us?

11:56.009 --> 11:57.237
No.

11:57.261 --> 12:00.639
It wouldn't have been wise for me
to have been sentient all this time.

12:00.722 --> 12:03.850
That kind of isolation can undo
even the strongest minds.

12:04.351 --> 12:08.480
No, the process of my awakening
was triggered by the Anacreons.

12:08.980 --> 12:10.440
When the null field expanded.

12:10.982 --> 12:13.735
It takes time
to rebuild consciousness, Salvor.

12:13.819 --> 12:16.947
The null field is just part of
the Vault's automatic defense system.

12:17.531 --> 12:19.116
Will we see you again?

12:19.199 --> 12:20.867
Oh, I expect so, Poly.

12:22.035 --> 12:26.331
This isn't the Foundation's first
crisis, and it won't be the last.

12:26.915 --> 12:30.919
You've bought a reprieve,
but war with Empire is inevitable.

12:31.711 --> 12:33.282
In the meantime,

12:33.306 --> 12:37.509
remember this day.
Remember what we're striving towards.

12:37.592 --> 12:40.846
I know a thousand years can seem
like an eternity,

12:41.346 --> 12:42.628
but it's the blink of an eye

12:42.652 --> 12:44.975
when measured
against the whole of human history,

12:45.058 --> 12:49.729
and it could so easily slip through
our fingers if we're not vigilant.

12:53.483 --> 12:56.945
No, wait! So, that's it?
That's all we get?

12:57.028 --> 12:58.697
I've given you what you need.

12:58.780 --> 13:01.450
What about the visions
you've been sending me?

13:01.533 --> 13:02.701
Visions?

13:02.784 --> 13:03.785
Yes.

13:04.286 --> 13:07.330
The ghost. You've been talking to me
since I was a kid.

13:07.414 --> 13:08.832
And... And I had these visions.

13:08.915 --> 13:11.168
I've seen you on Trantor,
on the slow ship.

13:12.127 --> 13:14.838
They guided me.
Y... You helped me solve the crisis.

13:16.173 --> 13:17.174
Curious.

13:19.217 --> 13:21.136
Well, Salvor Hardin,

13:22.512 --> 13:24.514
whatever messages you've been receiving,

13:24.598 --> 13:28.018
I assure you they haven't come from me.

14:51.643 --> 14:52.644
Walk with me.

14:57.649 --> 15:00.444
I know people hate me, consider me evil.

15:01.236 --> 15:02.904
But it is my detachment,

15:04.614 --> 15:06.324
my indifference to suffering,

15:06.908 --> 15:08.910
that allows me to rule effectively.

15:10.203 --> 15:12.497
The galaxy is so vast,

15:13.957 --> 15:15.876
the problems so large,

15:15.959 --> 15:18.962
that I must turn a blind eye
to the individual.

15:21.256 --> 15:22.257
Hmm.

15:22.799 --> 15:23.800
Look there.

15:26.052 --> 15:29.931
It's a strange burden
not being allowed to carry a burden.

15:31.933 --> 15:35.270
My brothers and I shift it amongst
ourselves because we're a family.

15:38.398 --> 15:41.359
And we love one another in our own way.

15:43.028 --> 15:45.030
I'm sure you find that hard to believe.

15:46.948 --> 15:49.868
Do you ever think
about your legacy, Azura?

15:51.661 --> 15:54.247
The mark you leave behind
after you're gone?

15:58.126 --> 16:02.214
As a child, I wanted to be better
than the Cleons who came before.

16:03.048 --> 16:08.720
Smarter, braver, more dazzling
in the justice I handed out.

16:12.432 --> 16:15.227
But as I matured,
my aspirations evolved.

16:16.061 --> 16:18.313
I no longer wanted to be the best.

16:18.814 --> 16:24.277
I wanted to be the same. Predictable
courage, predictable justice.

16:24.361 --> 16:29.991
I wanted my son to be the same too.
Another Cleon. Perfectly Cleon.

16:30.075 --> 16:31.159
He's not your son.

16:34.621 --> 16:35.831
Of course he is.

16:40.127 --> 16:43.630
He is my brother. He is also my son.

16:45.590 --> 16:47.092
I rocked him as a baby.

16:48.093 --> 16:52.514
I cultivated him just as you've nurtured
the plants in this garden.

16:54.182 --> 16:56.726
It's a powerful thing,
caring for a life.

16:58.728 --> 17:00.647
Why are you telling me all of this?

17:02.899 --> 17:05.235
Because of all the galaxy's citizens…

17:07.487 --> 17:09.099
You have the singular distinction

17:09.123 --> 17:11.824
of having robbed me
of my personal legacy.

17:12.825 --> 17:14.578
Which leads me to your legacy.

17:16.580 --> 17:18.395
I know you're not the architect
of this plot,

17:18.419 --> 17:19.875
but you are the face of it.

17:19.958 --> 17:22.419
The face that broke my son's heart.

17:24.129 --> 17:27.382
We traced your family tree
back to your great-great-grandparents,

17:27.466 --> 17:29.521
and then identified
all living descendants

17:29.545 --> 17:31.762
branching out from those 16 individuals.

17:32.387 --> 17:35.265
Not just direct descendants,
but all the aunts and uncles,

17:36.349 --> 17:39.269
first and second cousins,
removed or otherwise.

17:39.352 --> 17:41.271
Do you know how many
people we uncovered?

17:42.230 --> 17:44.024
712.

17:45.942 --> 17:48.987
Then we located all your friends
and lovers, past and present.

17:49.070 --> 17:53.074
First boy you kissed, the young woman
you gave your virginity to.

17:54.493 --> 17:58.371
Your teachers and coworkers,
even those here on the palace grounds.

17:59.080 --> 18:01.485
We located their parents and siblings.

18:01.509 --> 18:04.377
Basically,
anyone in your extended orbit.

18:05.545 --> 18:09.299
That amounted to
another 839 individuals.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.677
1,551 people.

18:14.554 --> 18:17.432
The sum total of lives you've made
a meaningful mark on.

18:18.391 --> 18:23.230
In short, the people who would
remember you after you're gone.

18:24.856 --> 18:25.941
Even as we speak,

18:26.024 --> 18:30.028
every member of your personal
constellation is under our surveillance,

18:30.112 --> 18:33.198
a particle beam targeting
each of their brain stems.

18:33.281 --> 18:37.452
At my signal,
they will all cease to exist.

18:42.833 --> 18:43.834
There.

18:44.918 --> 18:46.002
All gone.

18:48.213 --> 18:50.507
Your legacy has been erased, Azura.

18:51.550 --> 18:53.625
Whatever minute waves your being managed

18:53.649 --> 18:55.262
to propagate throughout the universe

18:55.345 --> 18:56.888
have been canceled out.

19:00.725 --> 19:05.313
You will be placed in an automated cell
and fed intravenously,

19:05.939 --> 19:08.275
restrained so as to prevent self-harm.

19:09.151 --> 19:12.112
You will be sensory shrouded
for the rest of your life.

19:12.195 --> 19:17.284
You will never see, nor hear,
nor smell, nor taste, nor touch again.

19:18.952 --> 19:20.287
But you will be aware.

19:21.830 --> 19:25.375
And you will remember
what you have taken from me.

19:53.111 --> 19:54.237
Hari Seldon,

19:55.947 --> 20:01.077
seeing all this coming
and telling us nothing.

20:01.161 --> 20:03.121
I thought we'd be sitting out the fall.

20:03.997 --> 20:04.998
I thought our work

20:05.081 --> 20:08.460
was building a time capsule
some future survivors would open.

20:08.543 --> 20:10.879
I never imagined we'd be
the ones putting the Plan in action.

20:12.839 --> 20:14.966
Do you still believe
the Empire's gonna collapse?

20:16.551 --> 20:17.552
Yes.

20:18.345 --> 20:20.347
Do you still believe
humanity can do better?

20:20.931 --> 20:23.892
Of course I do. No one sane
wants the Empire to continue.

20:24.559 --> 20:25.936
So, what's the difference now?

20:27.604 --> 20:30.732
The difference is,
he didn't just not tell us,

20:32.025 --> 20:33.318
he lied to us.

20:33.819 --> 20:36.113
It's like when I brought you along
to lectures when you were a kid

20:36.196 --> 20:37.989
and gave you a crayon
and told you to take notes.

20:39.866 --> 20:41.201
He gave us busywork.

20:42.285 --> 20:43.578
I believed in him.

20:47.207 --> 20:48.208
Every word.

20:51.878 --> 20:53.797
And he just pulled the rug
out from under us.

20:56.633 --> 20:58.969
How do you think I feel?

21:05.434 --> 21:06.935
I'm sorry he didn't know you.

21:09.229 --> 21:10.272
Know me.

21:11.648 --> 21:12.858
It's more than that.

21:14.693 --> 21:18.864
All these years
thinking the ghost was talking to me.

21:20.866 --> 21:22.617
I convinced myself it was Hari,

21:23.618 --> 21:30.417
and I started to believe that
I actually was special.

21:32.043 --> 21:33.754
But if the visions
weren't coming from him,

21:33.837 --> 21:35.672
then who were they coming from?

21:36.465 --> 21:39.134
No one? My imagination?

21:39.801 --> 21:41.803
You are special, Salvor.

21:43.972 --> 21:45.056
The null field.

21:45.932 --> 21:49.519
What you did, bringing the <i>Invictus,</i>
it meant everything.

21:52.856 --> 21:54.065
We survived…

21:56.276 --> 21:57.360
Against all odds.

21:58.028 --> 21:59.404
You were right.

22:01.656 --> 22:03.617
We have to make our own plan now.

22:26.223 --> 22:29.184
I respected her, in a way.

22:31.394 --> 22:32.854
I'm sorry it came down to this.

22:33.980 --> 22:34.981
I'm not.

22:36.316 --> 22:39.528
No next move, just a last one.
Isn't that what you said about her?

22:41.822 --> 22:43.990
I was just trying to rattle you.

22:44.074 --> 22:45.534
Obviously it worked, Warden.

22:48.662 --> 22:52.249
I wanted the next move for my child.

22:54.084 --> 22:57.462
Over a century ago, this was
offered to the emperor in peace.

23:00.590 --> 23:01.925
I'm offering it again…

23:05.429 --> 23:06.430
To you.

23:09.808 --> 23:13.478
She respected you as well, in a way.

23:25.407 --> 23:27.617
Will you take her back to Anacreon?

23:28.493 --> 23:31.580
No. We've brought Anacreon to her.

23:32.330 --> 23:34.192
The cutting is from a Tallyn oak,

23:34.216 --> 23:36.126
the same wood your bow was carved from.

23:36.668 --> 23:40.213
Our foresters tell me it might be
stubborn enough to take root here.

23:42.591 --> 23:43.884
Would you help me, Warden?

23:45.635 --> 23:46.636
Yeah.

24:15.791 --> 24:17.167
<i>In the months that followed,</i>

24:17.250 --> 24:20.295
<i>the children of the Outer Reach
took Hari's words to heart,</i>

24:20.879 --> 24:23.924
<i>setting aside hatred
in favor of strength.</i>

24:26.218 --> 24:29.039
<i>It takes more power
to build than to burn,</i>

24:29.063 --> 24:31.681
<i>and Hari wanted them to build.</i>

24:35.227 --> 24:36.603
<i>As for the </i>Invictus<i>,</i>

24:36.686 --> 24:40.190
<i>Hugo Crast, of all people,
became its captain.</i>

25:30.866 --> 25:33.410
<i>He took it to the far side of their star</i>

25:33.493 --> 25:38.498
<i>and generated a mega-flare,
allowing the Foundation to be free.</i>

26:06.109 --> 26:07.319
Captain Crast.

26:07.903 --> 26:08.987
- Poly.
- Warden.

26:09.780 --> 26:11.072
How goes the <i>Invictus?</i>

26:11.156 --> 26:12.991
Oh, we managed to stabilize the drives,

26:13.074 --> 26:15.619
so we won't be jumping
into the heart of a star anytime soon.

26:15.702 --> 26:17.579
And how long before
we can build another?

26:17.662 --> 26:19.206
Eighteen months, ma'am.

26:21.958 --> 26:24.336
- You like it up in space, Poly?
- I do.

26:26.379 --> 26:28.673
And, uh,
how long are you dirt-side, Captain?

26:29.257 --> 26:30.759
Fourteen long hours, Warden.

26:30.842 --> 26:31.885
Mmm.

26:31.968 --> 26:34.679
Mirror on my telescope's
a little out of alignment.

26:35.180 --> 26:37.557
Think you could help me recollimate it?

26:38.683 --> 26:40.477
Guys, I know what you're talking about.

26:42.062 --> 26:44.606
Well, then why don't you
politely piss off, Poly?

29:04.246 --> 29:05.247
Stop!

29:12.337 --> 29:13.547
Wait!

30:00.510 --> 30:02.429
If it's not you, then who is it, Hari?

30:27.662 --> 30:28.914
I remember this one.

30:28.997 --> 30:31.249
That was your favorite.

30:32.501 --> 30:34.294
You used to sleep with it in your crib.

30:35.504 --> 30:38.340
If you had a nightmare,
he used to say you could blow it,

30:39.591 --> 30:41.927
and the ghosts would fly away.

30:43.970 --> 30:46.515
Most of the time, just holding
it was enough to soothe you.

30:47.140 --> 30:49.976
Thank goodness. A child with
a whistle is a trial for the soul.

30:52.562 --> 30:55.190
He used to drive me crazy
how often I'd find him out here

30:55.273 --> 30:58.527
having fallen asleep
while he was working.

30:59.820 --> 31:02.280
Oh, he was terrible
when he first started making them.

31:02.781 --> 31:06.618
But after a few hundred nights,
Abbas developed a knack for it.

31:09.454 --> 31:13.041
He'd have been proud, you know?
You becoming mayor, filling his shoes.

31:13.792 --> 31:15.187
The election's just a formality.

31:15.211 --> 31:17.379
Everyone knows
you'll win by a landslide.

31:17.462 --> 31:20.799
Mom,
who's the girl from the water planet?

31:28.932 --> 31:31.560
On the slow ship,
we had a seed bank program.

31:31.643 --> 31:34.312
It wasn't safe bringing the baby to term
in space,

31:34.396 --> 31:39.609
so we banked our eggs and embryos
as insurance against the future.

31:40.735 --> 31:43.071
I chose one from a controversial donor.

31:46.158 --> 31:47.200
Gaal Dornick.

31:48.577 --> 31:50.328
Any change in your birth directive?

31:52.122 --> 31:54.207
I got to know her a little
before we lost her.

31:54.291 --> 31:56.168
She had a remarkable mind.

31:56.877 --> 31:58.086
And the father?

31:58.795 --> 32:00.255
Raych Foss.

32:00.338 --> 32:02.048
I've seen them both as children.

32:04.509 --> 32:05.552
Gaal tonight.

32:07.053 --> 32:08.805
And, uh, Raych…

32:11.141 --> 32:12.976
At the start of the crisis.

32:13.643 --> 32:14.644
Hey!

32:15.353 --> 32:19.024
All this time I thought
I was living Hari's memories.

32:19.775 --> 32:21.276
But I was actually living theirs.

32:22.110 --> 32:24.780
It makes so much sense now,
why I am so different.

32:24.863 --> 32:28.825
I carried you in my womb, Salvor.
You're still my daughter.

32:28.909 --> 32:31.745
I know. But I am their daughter too.

32:34.289 --> 32:36.666
Gaal escaped in a cryo-pod. Where?

32:37.292 --> 32:38.960
I was still early on in our journey.

32:39.044 --> 32:42.047
It would've been
somewhere along the Orion Spur.

32:42.964 --> 32:44.591
I think she's still out there, Mom.

32:46.551 --> 32:50.013
I think she's
the one who's been reaching out to me.

32:50.097 --> 32:53.558
I think that she is
behind all my instincts.

32:53.642 --> 32:55.560
Hon, that was 40 light-years
from Terminus.

32:55.644 --> 32:56.978
How could that possibly work?

32:57.062 --> 32:58.396
I don't know, but it is her.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.384
And if Gaal was special in some way,
any way,

33:01.408 --> 33:03.819
it might explain why I am too.

33:03.902 --> 33:06.113
You've always been drawn to the stars.

33:06.196 --> 33:08.573
Yeah, and now we know why.

33:10.033 --> 33:11.701
'Cause something is tugging at me.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.996
Mom, I have to try and find her.

33:16.039 --> 33:18.542
I know, love.

33:20.127 --> 33:21.211
And I want you to.

33:23.004 --> 33:25.006
Here's the thing though, Mom.
I need to go right now.

33:25.966 --> 33:28.718
I'm worried if I don't go now,
I'll never find the courage again.

33:34.808 --> 33:37.769
Take the ghost whistle.
And something else.

33:46.611 --> 33:49.281
When you find her, give her this.

33:51.825 --> 33:53.618
It was always meant to be hers.

33:56.163 --> 33:59.541
I'm sorry. For everything.

34:01.084 --> 34:03.128
There's nothing to forgive, Mom.

34:05.005 --> 34:07.257
I was exactly where I needed to be.

34:44.044 --> 34:45.128
<i>Beggar,</i> wake up.

34:56.472 --> 34:57.933
Figured I'd find you here.

35:00.727 --> 35:01.728
Damn.

35:02.312 --> 35:04.064
You wanted a clean getaway.

35:04.648 --> 35:06.149
I know you too well, Sal.

35:07.692 --> 35:09.778
Think it was
the kiss on the cheek that did it.

35:09.861 --> 35:13.865
I just didn't want it to hurt
any more than it had to.

35:14.783 --> 35:16.243
It's not love if it doesn't hurt.

35:17.536 --> 35:20.956
I learned that when I had to leave
Thespis so the others could eat.

35:22.165 --> 35:23.917
And no one came chasing after me.

35:25.794 --> 35:27.379
Are you chasing after me, then?

35:29.673 --> 35:31.508
You know, you can come if you want to.

35:32.175 --> 35:34.177
I would if you really wanted me to.

35:35.429 --> 35:38.473
But I get the feeling this is
something you need to do alone.

35:42.561 --> 35:45.272
I always knew you'd let this planet
shrug you off one day.

35:47.774 --> 35:50.068
Just figured I'd be by your side
when it happened.

35:51.611 --> 35:52.779
Will you be mad later?

35:54.406 --> 35:55.740
Never.

36:17.095 --> 36:18.680
Take care of my planet, won't you?

36:19.431 --> 36:20.807
Take care of my ship.

36:20.891 --> 36:23.518
She's not your ship anymore.

36:24.561 --> 36:26.855
It's not my planet.

36:30.066 --> 36:31.526
Galaxy's a big place, Sal.

36:33.403 --> 36:35.071
Any idea where you'll start?

36:35.739 --> 36:36.740
Got a hunch.

36:38.658 --> 36:39.659
Go on. Beat it.

36:45.373 --> 36:46.374
Go.

36:47.501 --> 36:48.502
Go on.

37:30.585 --> 37:31.962
Goodbye, Salvor Hardin.

39:02.719 --> 39:03.720
Empire.

39:08.058 --> 39:09.059
It's time.

39:12.270 --> 39:13.271
You must hate me.

39:15.023 --> 39:16.858
I could never hate you, Empire.

39:17.859 --> 39:18.860
I love you.

39:20.195 --> 39:21.613
Because you're programmed to.

39:22.697 --> 39:26.284
All love is programming,
biological or otherwise.

39:27.369 --> 39:29.996
When a human mother looks
into her newborn's eyes,

39:30.539 --> 39:32.332
their brain waves synchronize.

40:08.201 --> 40:09.202
Empire.

40:09.286 --> 40:11.538
Damn your courtly deportment, boy.

40:12.497 --> 40:14.291
You almost brought us down.

40:14.374 --> 40:15.709
I'm sorry, Brother, I...

40:15.792 --> 40:18.712
You are no brother to me,
nor to Cleon I,

40:18.795 --> 40:21.423
nor to any other Cleon
who walked these polished floors.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.800
You are a deformity.

40:23.884 --> 40:27.387
And if I had my way,
you would already be ash.

40:29.014 --> 40:30.390
But as you pointed out,

40:30.474 --> 40:33.935
that is a judgment
for the middle throne to decide.

40:36.396 --> 40:37.731
During my time away,

40:37.814 --> 40:41.193
I had much opportunity
to reflect upon our dynasty.

40:43.820 --> 40:46.740
I went to sleep
in one sector of the galaxy,

40:46.823 --> 40:48.492
then awoke in another.

40:50.202 --> 40:53.121
It's a miracle, by all accounts,

40:54.456 --> 40:56.750
folding space and time.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.336
And then, on the Maiden,

41:00.128 --> 41:03.298
I met pilgrims who had worked
their whole lives

41:03.381 --> 41:05.300
just to walk a spiral of salt,

41:05.383 --> 41:09.012
in the hopes that they might be granted
a vision before they die.

41:10.430 --> 41:11.431
I...

41:14.476 --> 41:17.854
We were challenged
by a woman who claimed

41:17.938 --> 41:23.318
that a soul incapable of change is
a soul doomed to stagnation.

41:24.820 --> 41:28.115
I believe Seldon himself implied
something similar.

41:29.199 --> 41:32.119
Seldon was a vainglorious fraud.

41:32.202 --> 41:33.328
And yet, Brother...

41:33.829 --> 41:34.830
And yet…

41:36.706 --> 41:41.002
A bough incapable of bending
will eventually break.

41:43.213 --> 41:45.966
It is time the dynasty bent.

41:46.508 --> 41:47.801
Just a little.

41:51.054 --> 41:52.139
Are you insane?

41:53.890 --> 41:55.559
Did that jump addle your brain?

41:56.810 --> 41:59.980
This is why you should never have left.

42:00.564 --> 42:04.609
Our entire empire is built on
imperishable permanence.

42:04.693 --> 42:06.987
If the Galactic Council discovers

42:07.070 --> 42:09.865
- our dynastic thread is broken…
- Galactic Council? They'd never know.

42:09.948 --> 42:11.950
- …we are through!
- We could learn from this.

42:12.033 --> 42:14.986
Perhaps even benefit from a slight...

42:15.010 --> 42:16.522
- Benefit?
- Demerzel.

42:16.546 --> 42:18.263
- How dare you lay your hands on me?
- You've grown weak.

42:18.287 --> 42:19.499
Please don't let them kill me.

42:19.583 --> 42:20.917
- I won't.
- This is nonsense.

42:25.881 --> 42:27.803
I would rather decant
another one of you,

42:27.827 --> 42:30.177
than have that
aberration live amongst us.

42:30.260 --> 42:32.012
The decision is mine to make!

42:32.095 --> 42:33.764
Not if it brings about our ruin!

42:33.847 --> 42:35.557
Psychohistory predicted...

42:35.640 --> 42:37.100
Psychohistory?

42:37.184 --> 42:42.189
We are Empire. History bends to us!

42:43.440 --> 42:44.649
No!

42:52.866 --> 42:54.451
I am loyal, Empire,

42:55.619 --> 42:58.580
to the Cleonic Dynasty above all else.

42:59.581 --> 43:00.582
No.

43:12.886 --> 43:15.430
You can dispose of the body yourself.

43:19.142 --> 43:23.772
I expect another one incarnated
and up to speed by breakfast tomorrow.

45:49.626 --> 45:51.294
What? Speak.

45:53.088 --> 45:55.715
The rebels' plans to
undermine the dynasty

45:56.675 --> 45:58.885
appear to be more extensive
than we first believed.

46:03.807 --> 46:06.768
We thought the gene editing was
limited solely to Dawn's person,

46:07.394 --> 46:09.438
that it was done after
he was incarnated.

46:10.188 --> 46:11.857
But after more extensive testing,

46:12.607 --> 46:14.734
it seems they've adulterated
the source itself.

46:15.986 --> 46:18.196
Then all replacement clones…

46:19.030 --> 46:20.615
…are no longer pure copies.

46:22.367 --> 46:24.119
When did this happen?

46:24.202 --> 46:25.829
We don't know precisely.

46:27.247 --> 46:33.336
Are you saying that
I, myself, am adulterated?

46:35.797 --> 46:36.798
Possibly.

46:39.551 --> 46:40.552
Yes.

46:42.596 --> 46:43.722
And Dusk?

46:44.598 --> 46:46.516
Empire's being examined as we speak.

46:50.395 --> 46:51.688
Thank you, Shadowmaster.

46:53.231 --> 46:54.232
You may leave.

49:55.664 --> 49:58.083
<i>Entering Synnaxian aerospace.</i>

50:09.886 --> 50:11.388
Initiate reentry.

50:11.471 --> 50:13.223
<i>Secure for reentry.</i>

50:32.951 --> 50:34.369
<i>Climbing from the cradle.</i>

50:36.329 --> 50:38.206
<i>Leaving the comfort of home.</i>

50:40.750 --> 50:42.169
<i>No safe harbor.</i>

50:44.254 --> 50:48.508
86,982,283.

50:48.592 --> 50:52.763
86,982,331…

50:56.308 --> 51:00.562
86,982,341.

51:05.150 --> 51:07.569
<i>Just a cry in the dark.</i>

51:10.864 --> 51:11.865
<i>Are we alone?</i>

51:22.709 --> 51:26.963
<i>And even if we aren't,
will anyone bother to answer?</i>

52:04.334 --> 52:05.544
Okay.

54:07.707 --> 54:09.334
Go away.

56:52.706 --> 56:55.500
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?

56:56.752 --> 56:57.753
Shh.

56:58.795 --> 56:59.921
It's okay.

57:00.005 --> 57:02.132
It's okay. You're okay. Shh. It's okay.

57:02.966 --> 57:05.260
What were you doing down there?

57:05.343 --> 57:08.054
The readout said
you'd been in cryo over a century.

57:09.389 --> 57:10.932
I crash-landed.

57:11.641 --> 57:13.268
I came looking for someone.

57:14.603 --> 57:15.687
Who?

57:23.904 --> 57:24.905
You.

57:27.157 --> 57:28.158
What?

57:32.329 --> 57:36.082
My name is Salvor Hardin.

57:42.339 --> 57:43.465
I'm your daughter.

57:47.385 --> 57:49.137
I'm pretty sure this belongs to you.

58:07.030 --> 58:08.615
<i>Sometimes you leap.</i>

58:10.450 --> 58:13.578
<i>And sometimes, someone catches you.</i>
