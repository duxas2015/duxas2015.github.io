01:27.129 --> 01:29.548
When I was a child, I told my mother

01:29.631 --> 01:32.759
I wanted to learn every planet
in the Galactic Empire…

01:34.803 --> 01:37.890
beginning in the center
and moving out to Star's End.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.226
Each night, she told me stories.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.190
I traveled light-years…

01:48.150 --> 01:51.236
my mind expanding
to hold more and more worlds.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.908
But I never reached Terminus.

01:56.992 --> 02:01.914
Straddling the farthest reaches
of civilization, unsettled by man…

02:03.248 --> 02:04.416
it was the end.

02:10.839 --> 02:14.676
And its story remained dark to me
until many years later.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.513
Until it became my story.

02:19.433 --> 02:20.851
Until it became…

02:21.917 --> 02:23.585
the only story.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.048
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.052
- Where are the others?
- We're meeting them at the fence.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.078
We're a bit late.

03:00.578 --> 03:01.996
Come on, guys.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.027
- Gia!
- It's so rocky.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.118
Shit.

03:23.081 --> 03:24.124
A bishop's claw.

03:24.921 --> 03:27.507
- Up-valley.
- We need to be real quiet.

03:33.375 --> 03:36.086
The null field starts all the way
up there. Near that rock.

03:37.979 --> 03:40.190
They called it "the Vault."

03:40.387 --> 03:42.097
All the colonists knew for certain

03:42.122 --> 03:45.041
was that it projected a field
designed to keep people away.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.728
No one could breach it.

03:52.793 --> 03:54.711
Right, you gonna go first?

03:54.902 --> 03:56.445
I thought you were first?

03:57.517 --> 03:59.644
You go first
and put your marker past the rock,

04:00.311 --> 04:02.313
- I'll let you touch my tit.
- Gia.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.452
For one minute.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.895
Ten seconds.

04:05.309 --> 04:07.270
Or you can look at 'em both for 30.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.499
Swear on your moon.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.293
Four-sworn.

04:14.227 --> 04:17.021
- You get nothing if you win.
- Get to watch him piss his pants.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.303
He isn't gonna make it.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.263
Come on, Keir.

04:50.612 --> 04:51.613
Keir.

04:53.018 --> 04:53.977
Are you okay?

04:54.002 --> 04:56.588
- Your brother is an assclaw.
- Gia, stop laughing at him.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.592
- He's pathetic.
- I was almost there. I was close.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.034
Poly, where you going?

05:02.059 --> 05:04.137
- Shit. Poly!
- Poly, come back!

05:04.221 --> 05:06.390
- We don't have a deal.
- I know.

05:07.101 --> 05:08.436
I wanna see the ghost.

05:12.563 --> 05:13.772
Okay.

05:38.658 --> 05:39.909
Shit.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.411
- Poly?
- He's not moving.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.638
Poly?

05:47.431 --> 05:50.173
- We gotta get help.
- What you standing there for then?

06:19.505 --> 06:21.381
They're all gone. Eat.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.114
I saw the ghost.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.307
You saw me.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.693
Eat.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.647
You should've turned back,
like your boy Keir.

06:36.672 --> 06:39.508
People who've tried to get closer
have been hurt. Really.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.700
You weren't.

06:40.847 --> 06:43.141
You got the record and you're okay.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.364
Am I?

06:45.447 --> 06:48.116
Your mark is so far,
no one's ever seen it.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.204
That's because it doesn't exist.
And neither does the ghost.

06:56.369 --> 06:59.706
When do you think it's going
to tell us what it is, Warden?

07:00.631 --> 07:01.715
Call me Salvor.

07:03.006 --> 07:05.092
And you assume it
cares anything about us?

07:06.185 --> 07:07.186
It doesn't.

07:08.590 --> 07:12.552
It's not just people it keeps away.
It's everything. It's birds, insects.

07:12.830 --> 07:16.458
No one's ever gotten through
the null field, and no one ever will.

07:16.812 --> 07:20.399
It's warning us to stay away.
So stop tempting fate.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.193
Go. Be careful.

07:23.855 --> 07:26.983
- There's a bishop's claw...
- Up-valley. I know.

07:32.703 --> 07:36.748
Salvor Hardin. Hober Mallow. The Mule.

07:36.773 --> 07:38.858
I would learn these names one day.

07:42.504 --> 07:46.884
The heroes and villains
fighting for the salvation of mankind.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.553
But to understand our future,

07:49.578 --> 07:52.956
we have to remember the past
and the ones who caused it all.

07:54.226 --> 07:55.435
A mathematician.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.477
A martyr.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.188
A murderer.

08:00.898 --> 08:05.027
And the most important player of all,
Hari Seldon.

08:15.144 --> 08:16.937
She'll be on her way soon.

08:22.886 --> 08:25.013
It will all work out, Raych.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.174
Everything is dying.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.812
That doesn't mean it won't all work out.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.013
Do you ever wish there was another way?

08:33.038 --> 08:34.539
Every day, son.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.894
But this is the optimal time.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.871
86,960,947.

08:58.956 --> 09:02.125
86,960,957.

09:02.791 --> 09:05.794
86,960,971.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.299
- 86,960,987...
- It's time.

09:10.843 --> 09:14.054
Gaal? Are you ready?

09:16.390 --> 09:17.391
Yes.

09:21.696 --> 09:24.949
All my life, I looked out and dreamed
of being somewhere else.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.235
Now I realize
how much I'll miss this view.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.387
I have to remember it perfectly.

09:31.678 --> 09:32.846
No, you don't.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.118
We can petition the Seer priests.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.540
It's not too late for you to stop this.

09:39.785 --> 09:41.665
It's not too late for you to stay.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.791
No.

09:44.126 --> 09:46.403
There's no place for me here anymore,
Mom.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.006
I'll die if I stay here.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.342
But on Trantor, I'll be safe.

09:53.687 --> 09:54.772
Accepted.

09:57.420 --> 09:58.797
Hold your head high.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.538
That's her.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.997
They all hate me.

10:33.021 --> 10:34.384
You don't hate me, do you?

10:34.409 --> 10:37.662
Never, Gaal. I'll always love you.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.752
My greatest joy.

11:30.316 --> 11:31.317
Come with me.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.485
We'd be lost out there.

11:37.245 --> 11:38.329
Go.

11:44.663 --> 11:45.855
I love you.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.584
Go, child.

12:37.341 --> 12:39.426
Beginning transfer sequence.

12:39.510 --> 12:42.888
Please move to jumppods
and secure for travel.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.353
Did you say something?

12:49.436 --> 12:51.821
No. But I was going to ask

12:51.845 --> 12:54.274
if this was
your first time on an imperial jumpship.

12:54.611 --> 12:57.823
Yes. It is. I'm a bit nervous.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.614
Just place your hand on the screen.

13:00.639 --> 13:02.724
- And it will scan your metrics.
- Thank you.

13:05.197 --> 13:07.324
- Jerril.
- Gaal.

13:07.349 --> 13:08.517
Synnax?

13:08.705 --> 13:10.749
Picked up just a hint of it
in your accent.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.459
You don't hear it much at the Core,

13:12.484 --> 13:14.736
but I travel near
the rim worlds sometimes.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.881
Whoever took the prayer stones out
did a great job.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.601
You wouldn't see the scars
if you didn't know to look.

13:21.358 --> 13:23.151
Sorry if I overstepped.

13:23.262 --> 13:24.321
It doesn't screw me up,

13:24.346 --> 13:26.765
but some people come out of the jump
feeling a little hungover.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.559
I don't drink.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.562
My parents dove an algae farm,
and we woke up pretty early.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.189
You're gonna sleep through this.
They make sure of it.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.716
They can't have the grav on
during the jump. I don't know why.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.944
Well, the grav generators
output a waveform

13:39.027 --> 13:40.696
that corrupts the jumpdrive's ability

13:40.779 --> 13:43.532
to plot fourth-dimensional points
at transdimensional speeds.

13:44.493 --> 13:46.370
Why are you going to Trantor?

13:47.119 --> 13:49.204
I'm going to work with Hari Seldon.

13:49.859 --> 13:51.694
I won a math contest.

13:51.811 --> 13:55.735
Wow. Hari Seldon. And you from Synnax.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.213
It was a pretty big contest.

14:03.261 --> 14:07.056
Commencing jump in three, two, one.

15:14.993 --> 15:16.453
How are you awake?

15:32.266 --> 15:34.434
It's a pity we have to sleep
through the jump.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.104
It's supposed to be
quite the light show.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.815
But if you're not a Spacer,

15:39.840 --> 15:42.968
you can find your body and mind
taking different trips.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.736
I slept through the whole thing.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.697
…and prepare to disembark.

15:49.283 --> 15:50.450
Wow.

15:50.951 --> 15:55.038
If the Empire is good for anything,
they can damn well build.

16:00.439 --> 16:01.899
This is incredible.

16:39.291 --> 16:43.754
Welcome to Trantor,
the eye of the Empire.

16:46.340 --> 16:50.302
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.603
Are those soldiers?

17:00.996 --> 17:03.124
Probably didn't make the news
on your world,

17:03.847 --> 17:06.850
some sort of kerfuffle
at the galaxy's edge,

17:06.893 --> 17:08.685
Anacreon and Thespis.

17:09.445 --> 17:12.062
Imperial appraisers got caught
in the cross fire,

17:12.086 --> 17:13.242
so now it's a big deal.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.790
Sponsor and contact?

17:19.873 --> 17:23.335
Dr. Hari Seldon. Streeling University.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.712
Expected return to home planet?

17:26.380 --> 17:30.592
I'm not going back. This is my home now.

17:30.676 --> 17:35.097
Any car on the stalk.
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.123
Thank you.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.770
Now that I know you a little better,

17:42.342 --> 17:44.677
I won't waste my breath
explaining everything.

17:44.702 --> 17:45.911
This part is great though.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.570
Please make your
way to any available car.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.991
This car will commence
its descent down the stalk momentarily.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.209
I'm gonna stay awake the whole ride.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.327
Me too.

18:18.140 --> 18:23.437
It takes 14 hours to drop from
Trantor Station to the planet's surface.

18:25.731 --> 18:28.317
Although, technically,
it's not the surface.

18:28.942 --> 18:32.237
Billions of citizens spend their lives
beneath Trantor's outer shell,

18:33.155 --> 18:36.158
toiling away on
a hundred subterranean levels

18:36.183 --> 18:38.936
without ever seeing the sun
or the stars.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.882
Whatever remained of the natural world
belonged to the Emperors.

18:53.218 --> 18:54.344
Dawn.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.047
Day.

18:57.358 --> 18:58.359
Dusk.

19:00.184 --> 19:01.936
The Genetic Dynasty.

19:02.567 --> 19:06.779
Clones of Cleon I,
decanted at different ages.

19:21.671 --> 19:23.089
Master Orlio.

19:24.248 --> 19:25.415
Empire.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.918
How long have you worked for us?

19:28.001 --> 19:30.170
Sixty-eight privileged years, Empire.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.757
Started cleaning the
Mural when I was 12.

19:33.782 --> 19:36.868
Gone from one end to the other
four times over since then.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.388
Know every grain of chroma by heart now.

19:39.471 --> 19:44.434
Tell me, are there some colors
more resistant to cleaning than others?

19:45.102 --> 19:46.103
Plum.

19:46.640 --> 19:47.641
Periwinkle.

19:48.605 --> 19:51.567
Saffron is a particularly
truculent pigment.

19:51.650 --> 19:55.529
What about crimson?
Is crimson truculent?

19:56.338 --> 19:57.339
Empire?

19:57.364 --> 19:58.574
It's come to our attention

19:58.599 --> 20:02.353
that a tract authored by Hari Seldon
was discovered in your quarters.

20:02.387 --> 20:04.848
Apologies, Empire. It was foolish of me.

20:04.873 --> 20:06.010
It's just that I'd...

20:06.050 --> 20:10.109
Heard whispers of his proclamations
and were curious.

20:11.233 --> 20:14.945
They refer to Seldon
as "the Raven," don't they?

20:16.592 --> 20:20.262
I hear he's rather critical
of the Imperium.

20:20.345 --> 20:24.516
Well, I'm happy to report
that his words are baseless trash,

20:24.541 --> 20:26.584
and atrociously written, if I might add.

20:26.727 --> 20:30.147
Nevertheless,
the man has amassed a following.

20:30.655 --> 20:35.577
People who hinge their hopes
on every word Raven Seldon utters.

20:37.072 --> 20:40.659
Words have a way
of fanning into wildfires, Orlio.

20:40.689 --> 20:42.733
I am loyal, Empire. I would never...

20:42.758 --> 20:46.720
I know you won't, which is why
I broached this subject in person.

20:47.303 --> 20:48.596
Empire...

20:58.467 --> 21:01.345
What are your lessons this morning,
Brother Dawn?

21:02.179 --> 21:03.847
The Outer Reach kingdoms.

21:03.872 --> 21:06.499
I learned an old Anacreon song
about hunting.

21:06.642 --> 21:10.938
Well, there is much truth in music.

21:11.892 --> 21:15.604
A boy bleeds a fawn with a knife
and then takes shelter in her coat.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.694
That one's not really a hunting song.

21:17.778 --> 21:20.405
That's a dirty song
about a boy's first time with a woman.

21:23.826 --> 21:26.954
Play it back in your mind.
And don't confuse the two.

21:27.052 --> 21:29.930
Brother Day, please leave
the peacock to the cooks.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.583
You'll be no less fascinating
to your biographers.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.212
Brother Dusk imagines
I do this to be colorful.

21:35.796 --> 21:38.966
And Brother Day puts more
words in my mouth than he does poultry.

21:39.108 --> 21:40.484
It's the lard.

21:40.509 --> 21:43.887
The cooks inject it under the skin
with a needle right before roasting.

21:43.912 --> 21:46.790
- Do you know why they use a needle?
- Because it's efficient?

21:46.879 --> 21:48.964
Because they're afraid
if they use a knife,

21:48.989 --> 21:52.123
as is the time-honored way,
they might rip the skin,

21:52.147 --> 21:55.172
and I'll send
them to a stew-pot stall 50 levels down.

21:55.607 --> 21:59.461
All of which is a problem. Why?

21:59.486 --> 22:02.698
Because when people are afraid
to do their job right,

22:03.158 --> 22:05.077
they're certain to do it wrong.

22:05.102 --> 22:08.352
- That's poor stewardship.
- It's poor roast peacock.

22:10.038 --> 22:12.291
Not everything is a teachable moment.

22:12.914 --> 22:14.332
Empire.

22:14.543 --> 22:15.711
Demerzel.

22:15.794 --> 22:18.797
The delegations from Thespis
and Anacreon are arriving.

22:18.881 --> 22:21.008
- How did they seem?
- Peevish.

22:21.717 --> 22:25.679
Barbarian kingdoms.
They're more trouble than they're worth.

22:26.835 --> 22:30.088
Have Outer Reach Trade bring
tariff projections to the residence.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.601
Dress nice.

22:32.833 --> 22:34.271
Have someone brush your hair.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.774
It's not the most important thing
we'll do this week,

22:37.799 --> 22:41.510
but it's the most important thing
they'll do in their lifetime.

23:01.131 --> 23:05.636
Anacreon and Thespis.
Observe the mannerisms of each party.

23:13.722 --> 23:16.349
They hate each other.

23:18.065 --> 23:21.777
Their enmity is legendary.
But war is expensive.

23:21.802 --> 23:24.763
And so we have called them
onto the carpet to broker a peace.

23:38.836 --> 23:40.212
Thanks for the company.

23:40.237 --> 23:43.616
Good luck with the new job.
I hope Hari Seldon is worth the trip.

23:43.641 --> 23:45.017
Thanks.

23:49.988 --> 23:51.072
Cute.

23:54.555 --> 23:57.141
Raych, Raych, Raych. Where are you?

24:03.735 --> 24:05.696
- That's me.
- What?

24:06.405 --> 24:07.739
That's me, Raych.

24:09.700 --> 24:13.287
I work for Hari. Dr. Seldon.

24:14.108 --> 24:16.313
- Baggage Claim is this way.
- No.

24:16.763 --> 24:18.941
No. This is all I have.

24:19.668 --> 24:20.669
Okay.

24:21.347 --> 24:23.308
Then the rest of planet is this way.

24:27.926 --> 24:29.970
It's supposed to be a perfect replica.

24:30.515 --> 24:32.517
Not that we'd know
under the outer shell.

24:33.018 --> 24:36.146
Half of level 64 is just
servers running skies.

24:39.369 --> 24:42.038
Is there still a Seer church
here on Trantor?

24:42.512 --> 24:45.557
Down there, I think. Level 22.

24:48.447 --> 24:49.740
I'd like to see it.

24:52.201 --> 24:53.202
What?

24:54.745 --> 24:55.996
Sorry, I've...

24:57.664 --> 25:00.000
I've never met anyone from Synnax
before.

25:09.426 --> 25:12.262
An expression of compassion
and stewardship,

25:12.346 --> 25:14.723
the Mural of Souls,

25:14.748 --> 25:18.627
worked on every day by the senior member
of the Genetic Dynasty.

25:18.675 --> 25:23.263
The Mural depicts the four-century age
of peace and the Galactic Family.

25:23.367 --> 25:26.996
Notice the active chroma?
How the pigment subtly moves?

25:32.889 --> 25:34.850
Provincial Ambassador Xandem.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.665
Do you have a question or a comment
about the Mural?

25:40.397 --> 25:44.360
We were just marveling
at the Empire's benevolent reach.

25:44.837 --> 25:46.296
For it is a marvel.

25:49.091 --> 25:52.678
86,963,537.

25:52.761 --> 25:55.973
86,963,549.

25:56.056 --> 25:59.434
86,963,563.

25:59.518 --> 26:02.855
963,567.

26:03.355 --> 26:07.067
86,963,573…

26:07.092 --> 26:10.137
- Are you praying?
- No. Why?

26:11.530 --> 26:12.573
Your lips were moving.

26:12.598 --> 26:15.434
Yeah. When I'm nervous, I count primes.

26:22.311 --> 26:23.896
Hari said you'd wanna see this.

26:45.983 --> 26:49.153
Gaal, meet Hari.

26:51.904 --> 26:53.155
Dr. Seldon.

26:54.441 --> 26:57.569
I am so honored you invited me here.

26:57.968 --> 26:59.803
What did you think
of the Imperial Library?

26:59.828 --> 27:02.748
It's amazing.
So many books in one place.

27:02.831 --> 27:05.751
I imagine books were hard
to come by on Synnax.

27:07.037 --> 27:08.914
Please, sit.

27:15.427 --> 27:16.448
So,

27:16.472 --> 27:18.847
you know Kalle's Ninth Proof of Folding?

27:19.473 --> 27:22.392
Yes, I couldn't have solved
Abraxas without it.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.518
No one else thought to use it.

27:24.542 --> 27:26.855
Not in 500 years.

27:27.859 --> 27:29.193
Why do you think that is?

27:30.234 --> 27:32.778
Kalle's writing is poetic.

27:32.861 --> 27:36.198
It's beautiful, but it's hard to imagine
there's any rigor there.

27:36.902 --> 27:39.362
So serious scholars don't read her.

27:41.995 --> 27:43.080
Why did you?

27:43.580 --> 27:46.917
I went to Kalle
for the rhythm of the words at first.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.502
I missed the math.

27:48.892 --> 27:51.255
But when I read between the lines,

27:51.280 --> 27:53.949
I realized she was proposing
a radical theory

27:53.974 --> 27:57.060
about rings of integers
in non-Archimedean local fields.

27:57.261 --> 27:58.762
Indeed she was.

28:00.055 --> 28:01.515
It does make me wonder, though,

28:01.540 --> 28:05.130
how you've managed to stumble across
Kalle's Ninth Proof

28:05.154 --> 28:06.378
in the first place,

28:06.520 --> 28:08.021
given where you were.

28:10.649 --> 28:12.870
This isn't Synnax, Gaal.

28:12.894 --> 28:15.112
Curiosity isn't a crime here.

28:16.039 --> 28:17.248
I was lonely.

28:18.505 --> 28:21.049
Almost no one there
thought like I thought.

28:22.190 --> 28:25.026
But math doesn't take sides.
It doesn't judge.

28:25.581 --> 28:31.128
I imagine you were lonely,
a mind like yours in a place like that.

28:38.635 --> 28:41.383
Kalle's original proof manuscript.

28:41.407 --> 28:43.557
Written in her native Thraxian.

29:00.616 --> 29:02.784
They're going to arrest me tomorrow.
And you.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.936
- What?
- It's almost a certainty.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.663
Arrest? Why?

29:06.688 --> 29:09.051
There's a nonzero
chance it won't happen.

29:09.075 --> 29:11.151
But it's not a number worth discussing.

29:12.131 --> 29:13.837
No. This has to be a mistake.

29:13.921 --> 29:16.715
People lie, Gaal. Numbers don't.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.176
Are you familiar with my work?
Psychohistory?

29:19.720 --> 29:22.514
- Every mathematician has read your...
- Do you agree with the concept?

29:22.638 --> 29:25.015
In theory. But I don't know
what it has to do with...

29:25.040 --> 29:26.333
It's not a theory.

29:26.475 --> 29:29.645
It's the destiny of the human race
expressed in numbers.

29:29.728 --> 29:31.897
And it's the reason
the Empire will take us.

29:31.980 --> 29:33.774
They're worried
you can predict the future.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.908
They're worried people believe I can.

29:35.932 --> 29:37.986
And they don't like
the future I predict.

29:38.270 --> 29:39.354
Which is what?

29:42.449 --> 29:45.577
Trantor is going to be destroyed.
The Empire will fall.

29:45.661 --> 29:48.914
You understand, these aren't things
I'm anxious to tell people.

29:48.997 --> 29:50.457
It's just what the math tells me.

29:50.541 --> 29:54.920
Why let me come all this way
just to arrest me?

29:55.003 --> 29:57.756
That's a good question. You tell me.

30:29.997 --> 30:31.790
Because I solved Abraxas.

30:32.708 --> 30:35.043
They think I'm the only one
who can prove you wrong.

30:35.127 --> 30:38.088
And you are, if I was. But I'm not.

30:39.256 --> 30:41.486
Did you know all this
when you were showing me the sights?

30:41.511 --> 30:43.868
There's more at stake here
than you can imagine, Gaal.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.538
I risked my life coming here.

30:49.057 --> 30:52.269
And now you want me to risk it again
just to support your numbers?

30:52.294 --> 30:55.047
That's not entirely accurate,
is it, Gaal?

30:55.148 --> 30:57.833
You left Synnax
one step ahead of arrest yourself.

30:57.858 --> 31:00.694
So you know math is never just numbers.

31:00.777 --> 31:03.113
In the wrong hands, it's a weapon.

31:03.947 --> 31:07.349
In the right hands, deliverance.

31:10.965 --> 31:12.092
Go.

31:14.202 --> 31:15.357
Get some sleep.

31:15.918 --> 31:18.670
It should take them most of the night
to divine your hotel.

31:18.754 --> 31:19.903
We'll talk soon.

31:21.882 --> 31:24.199
I know it's not the prize
you came here for…

31:25.540 --> 31:26.916
but it will have to do.

31:27.054 --> 31:29.473
- I can't keep this.
- Of course you can.

31:29.556 --> 31:32.133
This building will burn one day.

31:32.912 --> 31:34.978
Stealing is a mercy.

31:50.452 --> 31:52.579
I've read all his work, psychohistory.

31:52.663 --> 31:55.707
I just never imagined
he'd use it this way.

31:55.791 --> 31:58.752
The Empire isn't gonna hurt you.
They need you.

31:58.836 --> 32:00.838
You don't know that.
And neither does he.

32:00.921 --> 32:01.980
- Gaal...
- No.

32:02.005 --> 32:04.216
You haven't seen it.

32:04.963 --> 32:07.215
When a planet wants you dead, you die.

32:09.132 --> 32:12.761
Ambassador Xandem,
Planet Anacreon, Outer Reach.

32:16.061 --> 32:17.312
Empire.

32:21.817 --> 32:25.320
Carved from the oldest tree
in the Tallyn Forest.

32:25.946 --> 32:27.698
The same wood used to carve the bow

32:27.723 --> 32:30.851
of Anacreon's greatest hunter,
Larken Keaen.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.036
Thank you, Ambassador.

32:34.454 --> 32:36.290
Did you enjoy the Mural of Souls?

32:36.373 --> 32:40.169
Yes, Empire.
I have never seen anything like it.

32:41.443 --> 32:45.405
Honored Diplomat Shae Un Shae,
Planet Thespis, Outer Reach.

32:49.270 --> 32:50.647
Empire.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.725
A Thespin Book of Ablution.

32:55.309 --> 32:59.563
The filigree was recently smithed
to honor the imperial peace.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.816
Thank you, Honored Diplomat.

33:03.859 --> 33:07.321
And thank you, both delegations,
for making the journey to Trantor.

33:08.405 --> 33:09.805
Not that you had a choice.

33:11.825 --> 33:15.537
For nine centuries, the Anthor Belt
Agreement served your planets well.

33:15.562 --> 33:18.064
Last year,
Thespis identified a rogue asteroid,

33:18.089 --> 33:21.884
which they believe drifted
from the area governed by the agreement.

33:23.337 --> 33:25.047
We took no official position.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.191
Just our 10%.

33:28.768 --> 33:32.439
Anacreon believes
Thespis acts in bad faith.

33:32.869 --> 33:37.768
The Empire believes
imperial blood has been shed

33:37.793 --> 33:41.255
on a cold rock 50,000 light-years
from home.

33:46.749 --> 33:50.544
For any of these three beliefs,
a thousand wars have been fought.

33:51.325 --> 33:54.870
The next days will determine
if there will be another.

33:57.621 --> 34:01.542
Respect and enjoy the peace.

34:01.625 --> 34:04.711
Respect and enjoy the peace.

34:17.262 --> 34:20.639
Brother Dawn, what do you make of that?

34:20.811 --> 34:23.397
The Thespins want to remind you

34:23.480 --> 34:27.025
how important the Anthor Belt asteroids
are to their religion.

34:27.109 --> 34:29.987
But look there. In the metal filigree.

34:30.070 --> 34:33.197
The pattern in the sigil
is made of heavy palladium.

34:33.222 --> 34:36.934
The metal from the rogue asteroid.
How much would you say of the sigil?

34:37.077 --> 34:41.206
- Maybe a fifth of it?
- Closer to a quarter.

34:41.231 --> 34:45.151
Currently, the Thespins tithe 10%
of the mined ore to us.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.337
This is their way of quietly saying

34:47.362 --> 34:50.741
they'll go all the way to 25%
if we side with them.

34:50.882 --> 34:55.469
There's no metal here at all.
Not even in the arrow tips.

34:55.987 --> 34:58.907
That's right. Why?

34:59.057 --> 35:01.476
The Anacreons need palladium.

35:01.560 --> 35:02.978
They have none.

35:03.502 --> 35:07.441
It's like the hunting song.
It's not at all about hunting.

35:09.523 --> 35:12.859
Art is simply politics' sweeter tongue.

35:13.822 --> 35:17.034
The customs of the Outer Reach
may seem idiosyncratic.

35:17.717 --> 35:22.139
But our attention to detail
is how we maintain the peace.

35:22.215 --> 35:26.052
And if the people step out of line,
we hit them with a big stick.

35:26.316 --> 35:27.525
Thank you.

35:32.257 --> 35:34.885
Seldon and the girl.

35:36.930 --> 35:38.557
Don't overthink the stick.

35:40.599 --> 35:43.143
The Seer church. Do we have time?

35:46.104 --> 35:47.105
Yeah.

35:54.531 --> 35:57.409
She can sit. He will stand.

35:58.368 --> 36:00.454
But he will need to disarm.

36:07.647 --> 36:09.315
The heretic and I will talk.

36:18.762 --> 36:19.847
Upon awakening…

36:20.430 --> 36:21.974
Upon awakening…

36:21.999 --> 36:23.751
We speak the words.

36:23.892 --> 36:25.978
And the words make us seen.

36:26.180 --> 36:27.807
Do you know who I am?

36:28.814 --> 36:32.484
I know that she has torn
the Sleeper's words from her face

36:32.509 --> 36:34.677
and can't be seen by God.

36:34.820 --> 36:36.572
But do you know who I am?

36:36.597 --> 36:39.016
She has solved
one of life's ancient puzzles

36:39.043 --> 36:41.296
and cheapened the worth of life
in the solving.

36:41.321 --> 36:43.365
Of course I know.

36:46.165 --> 36:50.586
On Synnax, she is almost as famous
as her new god, Seldon.

36:50.611 --> 36:53.530
- He's not a god.
- No, he is not.

36:54.967 --> 37:00.180
He will die as all men like him die,
unseen by God.

37:00.304 --> 37:04.099
As will his followers. As will she.

37:05.726 --> 37:08.855
Gaal Dornick. I'll say this once,

37:09.697 --> 37:13.670
because I am the highest-ranking and
only Seer priest on this

37:13.940 --> 37:15.865
forsaken world.

37:17.156 --> 37:20.826
If you are in trouble, I can help you.

37:23.744 --> 37:25.162
Is that what you want?

37:51.438 --> 37:52.981
You want me to stay?

37:53.006 --> 37:54.757
Will that stop them from arresting me?

37:55.317 --> 37:56.360
No.

37:56.860 --> 37:58.278
I'll be all right.

37:59.064 --> 38:00.900
- I'll see you.
- Will you?

38:01.448 --> 38:02.866
Of course.

38:41.483 --> 38:44.402
Some like to pray one last time.

38:45.450 --> 38:46.535
Did you?

38:47.716 --> 38:48.759
No.

39:34.320 --> 39:36.030
What did you make of her?

39:36.668 --> 39:38.462
They haven't gotten to her yet.

39:38.545 --> 39:39.630
Yet.

39:40.292 --> 39:41.544
What do you make of her?

39:41.715 --> 39:44.885
She solved Abraxas on her own.
I'm sure of that.

39:46.178 --> 39:50.349
As for the other question,
well, we shall see.

40:41.358 --> 40:43.318
My name's Lors Avakim.

40:43.402 --> 40:44.987
Hari sent me.

40:46.572 --> 40:47.573
Where is he?

40:49.032 --> 40:51.910
Arrested. As he predicted.

40:52.828 --> 40:54.913
You've both been charged
with high treason,

40:54.997 --> 40:57.708
conspiracy to destabilize the Imperium.

40:59.001 --> 41:00.586
This is a nightmare.

41:00.622 --> 41:04.793
Hari wants you to know how sorry he is
for involving you in this.

41:04.843 --> 41:06.011
It's not his fault.

41:10.439 --> 41:11.649
Is it?

41:12.764 --> 41:14.308
We can speak freely now.

41:15.130 --> 41:17.715
Once the Imperium learned
of Hari's conclusions,

41:17.740 --> 41:20.409
they made no secret
of trying to disrupt the project.

41:20.459 --> 41:24.209
Did Hari bring me here as bait?
Because I can prove him wrong?

41:24.234 --> 41:26.194
He's not wrong, Ms. Dornick.

41:27.162 --> 41:29.846
But yes on the bait part.

41:50.135 --> 41:51.512
Are you all right?

41:51.595 --> 41:55.390
The hook hurts,
but I'm trying not to wriggle too much.

41:59.041 --> 42:00.543
All rise.

42:06.068 --> 42:10.197
The tribunal of Cleon XII is convened.

42:11.388 --> 42:16.810
Your Exalted, the offenders,
Dr. Hari Seldon and Gaal Dornick,

42:17.491 --> 42:21.203
are accused of crimes so grave
that they threaten not just Trantor

42:21.228 --> 42:23.439
but the entire galaxy's existence.

42:24.289 --> 42:27.417
I will prove that Dr. Seldon
and his followers

42:27.442 --> 42:31.195
engaged in a conspiracy designed
to destroy the confidence in our empire.

42:34.549 --> 42:37.135
Dr. Seldon. Will you rise?

42:37.837 --> 42:40.465
You hail from the world of Helicon, yes?

42:40.490 --> 42:41.551
Yes.

42:41.605 --> 42:44.398
Will you state your current position
here on Trantor?

42:44.481 --> 42:48.402
I'm a professor of probability theory
at Streeling University.

42:49.444 --> 42:53.031
Specifically, the area of psychohistory.

42:53.115 --> 42:54.825
Define that for us, please.

42:54.908 --> 42:58.579
Psychohistory is a predictive model

42:58.662 --> 43:04.209
designed to forecast the behavior
of very large populations.

43:04.293 --> 43:09.256
In plainspoken terms, you claim
to be able to predict the future?

43:09.339 --> 43:12.801
Well, I don't know
what you're going to have for dinner,

43:12.826 --> 43:14.202
if that's what you're asking.

43:14.227 --> 43:15.812
You know what I'm asking.

43:15.837 --> 43:18.867
The Galactic Empire comprises
some eight trillion individuals.

43:18.891 --> 43:21.810
Would you say that was a large enough
sample to make a prediction?

43:21.835 --> 43:22.836
It is.

43:22.861 --> 43:26.114
And do you have a prediction
for that particular sample?

43:28.775 --> 43:29.776
I do.

43:32.321 --> 43:33.655
Indulge us.

43:33.680 --> 43:36.477
Trantor and the Galactic Empire
will lie in ruins

43:36.501 --> 43:38.059
within five centuries.

43:40.204 --> 43:41.622
Silence, brethren.

43:41.647 --> 43:45.818
Accepting your statement for the moment,
can you prove it's true?

43:46.357 --> 43:50.194
Only to another mathematician
conversant in ordinal analysis.

43:52.247 --> 43:53.540
How convenient.

43:54.301 --> 43:56.979
Your truths are so esoteric

43:57.003 --> 43:58.180
- they escape the grasp
- They're not my truths.

43:58.205 --> 44:00.833
- of nearly every citizen.
- They belong to science.

44:00.974 --> 44:05.229
The Imperium is 12,000 years old,
Doctor.

44:05.312 --> 44:11.652
Are we really to believe
that it could be gone in just 500?

44:12.239 --> 44:14.074
- Maybe quicker.
- Quicker?

44:14.238 --> 44:19.785
A rotten tree trunk appears strong
until the storm breaks it in two.

44:20.212 --> 44:23.257
Consider recent events
in the Outer Reach.

44:23.413 --> 44:25.224
We're not here to consider any other...

44:25.249 --> 44:26.667
But you must!

44:28.635 --> 44:30.303
The Empire will fall.

44:31.089 --> 44:33.175
Order will vanish.

44:33.238 --> 44:35.866
Interstellar wars will be endless.

44:35.962 --> 44:40.870
Ten thousand worlds reduced
to radioactive cinders.

44:41.390 --> 44:44.476
Nothing we do can prevent this.

44:45.227 --> 44:50.232
This… period of barbarism.

44:52.276 --> 44:54.111
How long do you claim it will last?

44:54.194 --> 44:56.363
Thirty thousand years, Advocate.

44:57.781 --> 45:01.910
I submit to the court
that Dr. Seldon's "predictions"

45:01.935 --> 45:05.063
are actually intended
to destroy public confidence.

45:05.579 --> 45:07.914
I'm not a revolutionary.

45:07.939 --> 45:09.774
Well, then what are you?

45:10.627 --> 45:12.838
You've already said
the future cannot be changed.

45:12.863 --> 45:17.451
So what exactly is the purpose
of your project?

45:18.218 --> 45:21.096
I'm trying to soften the fall.

45:23.640 --> 45:26.185
It cannot be prevented,

45:26.210 --> 45:29.839
this mass of events rushing to meet us.

45:29.913 --> 45:33.583
But we can shorten
the dark ages that follow.

45:33.854 --> 45:35.063
How much?

45:36.149 --> 45:39.486
If we embrace your plan, how much?

45:40.324 --> 45:44.286
We should be in the dark
for a thousand years, Advocate.

45:45.191 --> 45:50.155
And if that is all,
we should thank the gods for it.

46:09.144 --> 46:11.104
My name's not really Jerril.

46:12.893 --> 46:14.561
But you can keep calling me that.

46:15.770 --> 46:17.689
We've been watching you for some time.

46:17.719 --> 46:20.681
From the moment you solved
the Abraxas Conjecture, in fact.

46:21.732 --> 46:22.983
I brought you a gift.

46:23.659 --> 46:27.204
He calls it the Prime Radiant.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

46:27.287 --> 46:31.291
He claims it contains all of his
predictions concerning the Empire,

46:31.375 --> 46:33.585
expressed as a mathematical equation.

46:33.669 --> 46:35.754
Did he allow you to examine it?

46:36.380 --> 46:37.381
No.

46:38.215 --> 46:39.883
Now, don't you think that's curious?

46:39.967 --> 46:42.057
He devises a theory so opaque

46:42.081 --> 46:44.029
that
no one in the galaxy can understand it,

46:44.054 --> 46:46.223
and when he finds an individual who can,

46:46.248 --> 46:48.125
he doesn't allow her
a look behind the curtain.

46:48.154 --> 46:49.488
Why?

46:49.618 --> 46:53.705
Because history is littered
with charlatans and false messiahs.

46:54.356 --> 46:57.150
What if he's telling the truth?
What if psychohistory is real?

46:57.175 --> 46:58.885
If his equations are flawed,

46:58.910 --> 47:01.413
you have a moral obligation
to expose them.

47:10.381 --> 47:12.050
And if they hold true?

47:12.207 --> 47:14.543
Disavow them and go home.

47:14.568 --> 47:18.739
And I promise you, Empire will find
a way to express his gratitude.

47:20.174 --> 47:22.301
I'll make the calculus
simple for you, Gaal.

47:22.384 --> 47:24.887
If you say Hari's a liar, he dies.

47:24.970 --> 47:27.181
If you don't, you die.

47:27.264 --> 47:29.892
So, we should just all
bury our heads in the sand then?

47:29.975 --> 47:31.810
If his equations hold true,

47:31.835 --> 47:35.130
then Empire will set about
solving the problem as we always have,

47:35.272 --> 47:37.608
without terrifying trillions of people.

47:38.108 --> 47:40.152
And I should believe in you, a spy?

47:41.778 --> 47:44.198
You should believe
in the minds that built Trantor,

47:44.281 --> 47:46.450
built the jumpdrive,
that built the Star Bridge.

47:46.475 --> 47:49.895
Where I come from, they call those
scientists, not politicians.

47:49.920 --> 47:52.297
I know where you come from, Gaal.

47:54.202 --> 47:56.079
They were called heretics and drowned.

47:57.794 --> 48:00.506
And I also know
what happened on the jumpship.

48:01.673 --> 48:03.050
During the jump…

48:05.052 --> 48:06.158
you were awake.

48:06.887 --> 48:08.160
You were aware.

48:10.456 --> 48:12.833
- Why did you lie to me about it?
- I don't know.

48:15.020 --> 48:16.104
It scares me.

48:17.439 --> 48:18.565
What does?

48:19.066 --> 48:20.715
Being different.

48:20.968 --> 48:22.591
We're all different, Ms. Dornick.

48:23.362 --> 48:26.198
My sister didn't speak
until she was seven.

48:26.223 --> 48:27.549
And even then, just nouns.

48:27.574 --> 48:29.535
But you're something else.

48:30.118 --> 48:32.704
And if you don't know what it is,
I urge you to figure it out

48:32.729 --> 48:35.482
before someone else does
and uses it against you.

49:28.594 --> 49:32.097
You claim your plan
can reduce the coming darkness.

49:33.098 --> 49:34.099
How?

49:34.183 --> 49:35.772
The ancients are rumored

49:35.796 --> 49:38.145
to have built
a repository for the world's wisdom.

49:38.228 --> 49:39.813
According to myth, it burned down.

49:39.897 --> 49:42.774
I'm proposing something
less centralized.

49:43.311 --> 49:45.772
An Encyclopedia Galactica.

49:47.029 --> 49:51.325
After the fall, as civilization climbs
from the ashes,

49:52.284 --> 49:56.038
the coming generations
will have something to build upon,

49:56.538 --> 49:57.956
a foundation.

49:58.790 --> 50:01.053
They won't have to reinvent the wheel.

50:01.077 --> 50:04.087
The knowledge will already exist.

50:04.171 --> 50:06.821
But it isn't just knowledge
we'd be saving,

50:07.341 --> 50:09.343
but humanity's story.

50:10.928 --> 50:13.222
Our story.

50:15.265 --> 50:18.101
Trantor already has an imperial library.

50:18.936 --> 50:19.937
For how long?

50:20.521 --> 50:23.524
Now, that statement does bring us
to the heart of the matter.

50:23.607 --> 50:25.768
You said you could prove your theorem

50:25.807 --> 50:28.487
to someone conversant
in ordinal analysis.

50:30.906 --> 50:32.950
Gaal Dornick, please rise.

50:34.826 --> 50:36.453
Approach the dais, if you would.

50:45.379 --> 50:49.132
You're from Synnax, correct?
We should say that.

50:49.157 --> 50:50.200
I am.

50:50.342 --> 50:52.302
You've had your prayer stones removed.

50:52.346 --> 50:54.431
You almost look like one of us.

50:54.488 --> 50:57.699
My understanding of your world
is that to remove the prayer stones

50:57.850 --> 50:59.643
is to break with the Seer Church.

50:59.726 --> 51:00.727
Is that right?

51:00.811 --> 51:03.480
That is church doctrine, yes.

51:03.564 --> 51:08.318
Tell me, are they still killing
scientists and mathematicians?

51:08.819 --> 51:11.363
If you're talking about the Purge, then…

51:12.157 --> 51:16.703
The church's term is "the Cleanse,"
Your Exalteds.

51:16.827 --> 51:18.662
When was it,
according to church doctrine,

51:18.687 --> 51:21.649
that it stopped being heresy
to study math?

51:21.790 --> 51:22.958
It never stopped.

51:23.041 --> 51:26.461
And yet you solved
the Abraxas Conjecture.

51:27.009 --> 51:28.010
Yes.

51:28.039 --> 51:31.042
On a world where they burned
the universities down.

51:31.466 --> 51:33.427
You must have been lonely there.

51:34.094 --> 51:36.343
I can imagine how it must have felt

51:36.367 --> 51:39.516
to be recognized by Dr. Hari Seldon.

51:40.893 --> 51:42.728
To be given a job. To be valued.

51:42.811 --> 51:44.188
What do you want to know?

51:44.271 --> 51:47.316
I want to know
if there is any possible way…

51:49.318 --> 51:52.696
you can be objective about Hari Seldon.

51:54.364 --> 51:56.241
I don't know. Maybe I can't.

51:57.534 --> 51:59.286
Maybe that's why he brought me here.

51:59.995 --> 52:01.580
Last night you were given a chance

52:01.605 --> 52:04.817
to assess the accuracy
of Dr. Seldon's claims.

52:04.842 --> 52:06.511
Did you arrive at a conclusion?

52:09.880 --> 52:11.131
Yes.

52:11.715 --> 52:12.674
And?

52:16.178 --> 52:18.764
Dr. Seldon's calculations…

52:19.684 --> 52:20.727
are correct.

52:21.165 --> 52:23.459
The Empire is dying.

52:24.937 --> 52:25.979
Kill them.

52:27.648 --> 52:28.815
End this.

52:42.871 --> 52:44.478
Hari, the sky.

52:45.639 --> 52:47.724
Something's wrong with the Star Bridge.

53:14.194 --> 53:16.613
Please respect and enjoy the peace.

53:18.323 --> 53:20.284
Expected return to home planet?

53:20.309 --> 53:21.519
Three days.

53:21.660 --> 53:24.121
- Please respect and enjoy the peace.
- Thank you.

53:30.460 --> 53:34.089
This car will commence
its descent down the stalk momentarily.

53:34.551 --> 53:36.053
You may feel a jolt.

53:36.842 --> 53:40.095
Please secure yourself
before commencing descent.

56:58.710 --> 57:02.005
The tether wrapped around
the planet like a garrote.

57:02.030 --> 57:03.656
It cut 50 levels down.

57:03.799 --> 57:05.259
- Emperor...
- Shut up!

57:16.436 --> 57:17.809
There are reports

57:17.833 --> 57:22.067
of Anacreon and Thespin
war cries before the explosion.

57:22.292 --> 57:23.610
Songs of rebellion.

57:23.635 --> 57:25.887
We had no part in this, we...

57:25.948 --> 57:29.285
We will, of course,
be returning your gifts.

57:30.367 --> 57:36.164
86,963,777.

57:39.126 --> 57:44.423
86,963,791.

57:50.637 --> 57:51.847
What are you doing here?

57:52.022 --> 57:53.649
I petitioned the committee.

57:56.153 --> 57:58.531
They're saying a hundred million dead.

57:59.479 --> 58:01.607
The Outer Reaches may be in rebellion.

58:02.303 --> 58:04.305
The attack's changed everything.

58:07.029 --> 58:09.740
Hari said there's
a nonzero chance you'll die,

58:09.765 --> 58:11.642
but nonzero is still a number.

58:12.492 --> 58:15.245
They're gonna kill Hari, Gaal.

58:17.331 --> 58:18.675
You don't have to die with him.

58:18.699 --> 58:20.542
I've already said his math was right.

58:21.957 --> 58:25.378
Say you looked at it again.
Say you were wrong.

58:26.212 --> 58:27.714
You've lost faith.

58:29.068 --> 58:30.486
I'm sorry.

58:30.610 --> 58:32.028
She doesn't need that.

58:39.652 --> 58:40.904
Get up.

58:45.140 --> 58:48.059
Shall I speak first, or will you?

58:48.237 --> 58:50.239
By all means, Dr. Seldon.

58:51.406 --> 58:52.407
Speak.

58:52.491 --> 58:53.951
You hold us responsible.

58:54.034 --> 58:55.369
How could I not?

58:55.394 --> 58:59.523
My science can predict societal actions.
Trends. Not individual ones.

58:59.982 --> 59:02.693
But I'm not surprised it happened.

59:02.876 --> 59:04.086
Why is that?

59:04.111 --> 59:05.696
You're stretched too thin.

59:07.339 --> 59:10.300
That's why the kingdoms
of the Outer Reach struck first.

59:10.325 --> 59:12.202
And who can blame them?

59:12.970 --> 59:15.331
Sensing vulnerability,
soon other players

59:15.355 --> 59:17.516
will begin to apply downward pressure.

59:17.599 --> 59:22.688
An exhortation from one of
the galaxy's major religions is a given.

59:22.771 --> 59:25.148
Or perhaps a homegrown
insurrection here on Trantor.

59:25.173 --> 59:27.509
Star Bridge. Who did this?

59:28.235 --> 59:29.945
I don't know.

59:29.988 --> 59:33.659
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you
and your followers right now.

59:33.684 --> 59:35.144
My followers aren't responsible!

59:35.169 --> 59:37.130
If you do,
you'll be dead within the year.

59:40.372 --> 59:42.207
The prodigy speaks.

59:51.175 --> 59:52.426
So speak.

59:54.701 --> 59:58.914
Your agent Jerril asked me
to check Dr. Seldon's work.

59:59.057 --> 01:00:01.185
I went a little farther in the equation.

01:00:01.707 --> 01:00:05.731
If you kill him, the fall accelerates.

01:00:05.814 --> 01:00:08.901
Well, that's a convenient data point
for your side.

01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:12.070
Only he can shorten the darkness.

01:00:13.322 --> 01:00:15.032
Kill him, you kill hope.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.534
Kill hope…

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.175
they kill you.

01:00:23.749 --> 01:00:25.209
What are the odds?

01:00:27.669 --> 01:00:31.840
The only two people who can save
the galaxy are in this room.

01:00:34.086 --> 01:00:35.963
And one of them is wrong.

01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:37.676
I agree.

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:44.353
If the fall can be accelerated,
can it not also be slowed?

01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:45.951
Yes.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.148
By a few centuries.

01:00:48.232 --> 01:00:50.067
Don't keep us in the dark.

01:00:50.692 --> 01:00:52.319
End imperial cloning.

01:00:54.446 --> 01:00:58.116
Imperial cloning stopped the wars.

01:00:58.141 --> 01:01:00.518
Imperial cloning brought peace.

01:01:00.627 --> 01:01:04.088
Our genetic dynasty has reigned
for almost four centuries.

01:01:04.113 --> 01:01:06.059
Surely you can understand the value

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:09.118
in a younger mind who
shares your intellect.

01:01:09.915 --> 01:01:13.001
Well, I see the value in difference,

01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:14.383
in the new.

01:01:14.883 --> 01:01:16.468
You offer nothing new.

01:01:16.552 --> 01:01:18.971
Just a younger grape…

01:01:20.848 --> 01:01:22.391
from the same vine,

01:01:22.416 --> 01:01:25.294
destined for the same old bottle.

01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:31.441
You can't save yourselves…

01:01:33.068 --> 01:01:35.112
but you can save your legacy.

01:01:35.195 --> 01:01:37.948
Yours or mine, Dr. Seldon?

01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:55.155
How long did it take you…

01:01:58.325 --> 01:02:00.244
to trigger the Prime Radiant?

01:02:00.971 --> 01:02:02.723
I got it on the second try.

01:02:06.067 --> 01:02:07.902
You knew they'd offer it to me.

01:02:14.318 --> 01:02:15.986
Hari, when I looked at it, I...

01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:20.699
I really thought they'd try
and make it seem more of a fair fight.

01:02:20.724 --> 01:02:22.601
But they didn't bother, did they?

01:02:22.743 --> 01:02:23.744
Did we?

01:02:26.413 --> 01:02:28.123
The hook still hurting you?

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:34.505
Xylas used the same phrase you did.
"I was lonely."

01:02:35.005 --> 01:02:36.965
They were listening.

01:02:37.049 --> 01:02:38.592
And you knew they were listening.

01:02:38.675 --> 01:02:41.261
- They're listening now.
- Fine.

01:02:41.345 --> 01:02:43.055
What do you want them to hear?

01:02:43.639 --> 01:02:47.935
Abraxas was the bait. Not you.

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:50.488
I just moved before they did.

01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:54.316
You have more agency here, Gaal,
than you realize.

01:03:14.838 --> 01:03:19.009
The Emperor has determined that
your deaths are not the optimal outcome

01:03:19.034 --> 01:03:20.619
for the good of the Imperium.

01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:24.054
You will be allowed to refine your work
on psychohistory,

01:03:24.137 --> 01:03:25.889
to build your Foundation.

01:03:28.642 --> 01:03:30.060
But not on Trantor.

01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:32.437
Terminus.

01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:36.775
It is uninhabited,
sitting in the Periphery,

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.718
along the galaxy's Outer Reach.

01:03:38.861 --> 01:03:41.405
Anacreon and Thespis are also
in the Periphery.

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:44.725
Yes, the barbarian kingdoms
will be your neighbors.

01:03:45.742 --> 01:03:47.411
You will journey via slow ship.

01:03:47.494 --> 01:03:50.539
The Empire forbids you access
to jumpdrive technology.

01:03:50.622 --> 01:03:52.207
You're exiling us.

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:56.170
On Terminus,
you will not trouble Trantor,

01:03:56.195 --> 01:03:59.073
and there will be no disturbance
of the Emperor's peace.

01:04:00.132 --> 01:04:02.926
The galaxy will know
that you are fighting the fall.

01:04:03.594 --> 01:04:06.096
If psychohistory proves fraudulent,

01:04:07.189 --> 01:04:11.610
your Foundation will be allowed
to wither and vanish.

01:04:12.186 --> 01:04:13.770
And if it's successful,

01:04:14.871 --> 01:04:19.292
you'll co-opt it
and use it to bolster your regime.

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:25.115
Terminus. I've never even heard of it.

01:04:25.199 --> 01:04:28.869
There's no reason you would.
It's 50,000 light-years away.

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:31.121
Without a jumpdrive,
the journey there...

01:04:31.178 --> 01:04:34.890
- 878 days.
- Approximately.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.668
We'll be fine.

01:04:36.705 --> 01:04:38.915
There'll be hardships, no question.

01:04:39.463 --> 01:04:42.633
Terminus orbits a red dwarf.

01:04:42.669 --> 01:04:45.547
Its seasons are extreme.
Metal and mineral poor.

01:04:45.572 --> 01:04:46.824
You know it well.

01:04:49.705 --> 01:04:51.290
Exile was always the plan.

01:04:52.226 --> 01:04:54.895
And Terminus was always
the optimal location.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.505
Out in the Periphery.

01:04:56.647 --> 01:04:59.316
Imperial support without imperial eyes.
It's perfect.

01:04:59.399 --> 01:05:00.484
How many others knew?

01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:01.693
Only Raych.

01:05:04.947 --> 01:05:06.907
What you said to the Emperor…

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:09.785
How much farther into my math
did you look?

01:05:10.315 --> 01:05:11.891
What did you actually see?

01:05:12.329 --> 01:05:14.289
- I couldn't quite figure it.
- So, you lied?

01:05:14.373 --> 01:05:15.791
I hypothesized.

01:05:16.959 --> 01:05:20.337
On Synnax, no one wanted to hear
that our seas were rising.

01:05:21.213 --> 01:05:24.112
I thought if I could make people listen,
that I could save them.

01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:28.679
Change is frightening,
especially to those in power.

01:05:28.704 --> 01:05:30.790
And I could feel the Empire's fear.

01:05:32.683 --> 01:05:36.520
When I looked into the Prime Radiant,
I could see the darkness.

01:05:36.603 --> 01:05:40.232
It took my breath away at first.
It was crushing.

01:05:41.248 --> 01:05:43.166
But then I looked deeper,

01:05:43.191 --> 01:05:44.637
and I could see

01:05:44.661 --> 01:05:48.404
this tiny sliver of light
at the very end of it all.

01:05:50.319 --> 01:05:53.322
And I realized
it's not the fall they're afraid of.

01:05:53.871 --> 01:05:56.456
It's the chance that
your plan will actually succeed.

01:05:58.468 --> 01:06:00.970
It takes more power to build
than to burn.

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:03.750
And I want to build, Hari.

01:06:04.923 --> 01:06:06.675
You'll get your chance.

01:06:07.952 --> 01:06:10.140
This isn't the
Foundation's first crisis,

01:06:10.164 --> 01:06:11.581
and it won't be our last.

01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:15.309
Something tells me you already know
what the next crisis will be.

01:06:16.293 --> 01:06:19.713
The Emperor's peace will be maintained.

01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:29.239
From Synnax to Trantor. Now Terminus.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:32.159
You came here hoping to save your world.

01:06:32.242 --> 01:06:34.661
I'm asking you to dream bigger.

01:06:35.679 --> 01:06:39.432
Why stop at one world?
Why not save the galaxy?

01:06:40.738 --> 01:06:42.031
Why not indeed.

01:07:11.406 --> 01:07:13.534
Hari had planned for it all,

01:07:13.559 --> 01:07:16.061
things only he saw over the horizon.

01:07:19.623 --> 01:07:22.043
Psychohistory could
forecast the behavior

01:07:22.067 --> 01:07:25.254
of entire populations
with stunning accuracy.

01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:30.008
But, when it came to individuals,
things got murkier.

01:07:34.639 --> 01:07:36.877
No one could approach the Vault.

01:07:36.901 --> 01:07:39.936
No one but an outlier
like Salvor Hardin.

01:07:41.203 --> 01:07:42.746
And I always wondered…

01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:46.603
when Hari was formulating his plan,

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:51.947
did he realize the galaxy's fate
would rest on what she found inside?

01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:54.741
I think he did.

01:07:55.865 --> 01:07:58.242
And I think
that's what he feared the most.

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:08.144
