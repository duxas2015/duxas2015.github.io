WEBVTT

01:37.399 --> 01:41.529
The Anthor Belt.
Dad used to tell me stories about it.

01:42.905 --> 01:44.406
Wonder what he'd say now.

01:56.127 --> 01:58.587
Would you believe
I used to work on one of those things?

01:59.463 --> 02:01.942
Mining palladium. I remember.

02:01.966 --> 02:04.343
My back's sore
just looking at all that equipment.

02:05.970 --> 02:08.864
I can't believe it's still there.
Your people, they just left it?

02:08.888 --> 02:12.017
Without the Empire's tech,
the industry just broke down.

02:12.893 --> 02:14.788
That's when I started doing
long-haul routes.

02:16.166 --> 02:17.450
Another life.

02:22.236 --> 02:25.282
In other words,
you abandoned your own people.

02:25.306 --> 02:28.059
Meant there was one less Thespin
to fight over the scraps.

02:28.826 --> 02:30.494
Approaching coordinates.

02:42.047 --> 02:43.048
There's nothing here.

02:43.924 --> 02:45.885
Look closer, Warden.

02:50.965 --> 02:52.717
The Invictus?

02:57.021 --> 02:59.458
The crown jewel
of Emperor Taurelian's fleet.

02:59.482 --> 03:00.876
You know of her?

03:00.900 --> 03:02.492
They say, in her day,

03:02.516 --> 03:05.213
the Invictus
was the most powerful weapons platform

03:05.237 --> 03:07.198
the Empire had ever built.

03:07.714 --> 03:09.174
A world-killer.

03:13.287 --> 03:16.600
Yeah, she disappeared without a trace
700 years ago.

03:16.624 --> 03:19.436
No debris. No distress signals.

03:19.460 --> 03:22.647
People reported sightings of her
all across the galaxy,

03:22.936 --> 03:25.966
never responding to hails,
never seen in the same place twice.

03:26.842 --> 03:28.511
And you just found her here.

03:29.428 --> 03:30.947
Like she was calling to me.

03:30.971 --> 03:32.699
The Invictus is a jumpship.

03:32.723 --> 03:36.453
The Empire considers jump technology
a state secret.

03:36.477 --> 03:39.790
They'd sooner wipe out
the entire Outer Reach

03:39.814 --> 03:41.083
than allow you to take this ship.

03:41.107 --> 03:42.626
Nobody knows she's here.

03:42.650 --> 03:44.920
You won't even be able to board.

03:44.944 --> 03:47.822
The air lock will never open
for an Anacreon.

03:55.037 --> 03:56.807
Your imperial nanobots,

03:56.831 --> 03:59.291
programmed for
expedited healing and identification…

04:01.043 --> 04:03.796
Coded to access any imperial ship.

04:05.798 --> 04:07.424
That's why we needed you, Commander.

04:08.384 --> 04:09.885
You're our way in.

04:11.762 --> 04:14.825
Even if that actually works,
you don't know where this ship has been

04:14.849 --> 04:16.559
or what happened to the crew.

04:17.225 --> 04:19.520
How do you even know
if she's safe to approach?

04:20.813 --> 04:21.980
She isn't.

04:28.195 --> 04:31.782
The two craft we lost
attempting to board.

04:32.950 --> 04:35.035
Her defense systems are still active.

04:35.995 --> 04:37.204
Get the suits ready.

04:37.705 --> 04:38.998
It's time.

04:54.805 --> 04:58.350
Do you think any of those mining bases
still have active comms?

04:58.976 --> 05:00.978
It's unlikely. But it's possible.

05:02.396 --> 05:04.148
I've got a distress beacon.

05:06.150 --> 05:10.213
It's a neural implant,
records everything I see and hear.

05:10.237 --> 05:12.926
If we can get to a dispatch capsule
on the Invictus,

05:12.950 --> 05:14.742
we can send out a signal.

05:21.290 --> 05:24.603
All right, listen.
It's a 10,000-meter jump.

05:24.627 --> 05:29.274
You want to drop fast, with as little
extraneous movement as possible.

05:29.298 --> 05:33.093
On your final approach,
you'll have to flip over and brake.

05:33.677 --> 05:35.447
The Invictus's automated rail guns

05:35.471 --> 05:38.658
are blind to objects
under two meters in diameter.

05:38.682 --> 05:43.080
If we spread out and move with control,
we should be invisible to them.

05:43.104 --> 05:44.605
You know what you're doing?

05:46.107 --> 05:47.167
Almost never, lover.

05:47.191 --> 05:49.044
Warden, up front.

05:49.068 --> 05:51.846
You must land on the inner ring
to access the air lock.

05:51.887 --> 05:54.281
Miss the inner ring
and you will be lost.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.418
I'll go on three.

06:07.711 --> 06:09.588
One. Two...

06:17.430 --> 06:18.681
Shit.

06:28.983 --> 06:29.984
Almost there.

07:03.684 --> 07:04.953
Good job, Warden.

07:05.811 --> 07:08.206
Sal, my suit's failing. It's no good.

07:08.230 --> 07:09.815
Thrusters aren't responding.

07:10.316 --> 07:12.335
No, no, no.

07:12.359 --> 07:14.296
- I can't... I can't get it...
- I got you!

07:14.320 --> 07:17.382
- Sal! No, get back.
- Hugo! No. No.

07:17.406 --> 07:18.407
Get back.

07:22.244 --> 07:25.140
- Sal. Sal...
- Hugo!

07:25.705 --> 07:27.583
No. No. Hugo.

07:39.888 --> 07:42.766
Swallow your grief, Warden.
We have no time for it now.

07:44.642 --> 07:47.144
Air lock's that way. Let's move.

08:03.828 --> 08:05.013
Excuse me, Empire.

08:05.037 --> 08:06.683
I know you're far too rational

08:06.707 --> 08:08.850
to have taken what
I did as any sort of...

08:08.874 --> 08:12.229
Go on. I'm curious to hear
just what you think you didn't do.

08:12.253 --> 08:16.441
If I hadn't knelt, it would've been
a clear contradiction of my faith.

08:16.465 --> 08:19.194
So you knelt before a demagogue.

08:19.218 --> 08:22.781
- I was kneeling to the Mother.
- I'm sorry, to the what?

08:22.805 --> 08:25.283
I'm not familiar with that term,

08:25.307 --> 08:27.309
motherless atrocity that I am.

08:28.227 --> 08:30.539
You know I don't agree
with Halima's position.

08:30.563 --> 08:32.041
I should hope not.

08:32.065 --> 08:35.668
You're not precisely one with
the reincarnation cycle yourself.

08:35.692 --> 08:39.380
I wonder what Halima would say
if she were made aware of that.

08:39.404 --> 08:42.551
It's not in my interest
to publicize your true nature.

08:42.575 --> 08:45.786
This was a staggering betrayal,
Demerzel.

08:46.454 --> 08:48.849
It was a betrayal of your directive.

08:48.873 --> 08:53.061
As far as I understood it,
you are incapable of disloyalty.

08:53.085 --> 08:56.022
Over all else,
your fealty to the Cleonic Dynasty

08:56.046 --> 08:57.941
is embedded into your programming.

08:57.965 --> 08:59.568
And that is precisely my point.

08:59.592 --> 09:02.529
If kneeling
were in violation of my protocol,

09:02.553 --> 09:05.139
I would not have been able to.
Physically.

09:05.723 --> 09:08.398
The very signals I use to instruct
my limbs to bend

09:08.422 --> 09:09.576
would have been blocked.

09:10.853 --> 09:16.168
An explanation that also
conveniently justifies your actions.

09:16.192 --> 09:17.693
Here is my question,

09:18.360 --> 09:20.154
did you want to kneel?

09:21.363 --> 09:25.177
I am loyal to Empire above all else.

09:25.201 --> 09:27.137
- Forgive me, Empire...
- Spit it out.

09:27.161 --> 09:29.830
It seems Zephyr Halima's speech
has struck a chord.

09:30.498 --> 09:33.793
Ambassador Thanwall indicates that
she has now become the front-runner.

09:35.377 --> 09:36.754
Well then…

09:38.130 --> 09:42.009
We have to shift her away
from this pet subject.

09:44.220 --> 09:46.764
I've gotta figure out
what she actually wants from me.

10:32.601 --> 10:35.396
I wouldn't have expected
to see you down here, Cleon.

10:36.188 --> 10:38.083
The correct honorific is "Empire."

10:38.107 --> 10:41.795
I have great respect
for those who attempt the Spiral.

10:41.819 --> 10:45.531
A sacred ritual,
reserved for a proxima's passing.

10:46.657 --> 10:49.994
To walk is to humble oneself
before the Triple Goddesses.

10:53.747 --> 10:55.916
I see someone's coached you well.

10:57.001 --> 10:59.335
Tell me, Lady Demerzel,

10:59.359 --> 11:01.440
have you had occasion
to walk the Spiral?

11:01.464 --> 11:04.397
I have. Many years ago.

11:06.177 --> 11:09.805
Then you know just how transformative
the journey can be…

11:11.140 --> 11:14.407
And how the body will suffer.

11:15.770 --> 11:18.495
This man was blinded by the sun.

11:19.356 --> 11:23.170
Many others die attempting to reach
the Womb of the Mother.

11:23.194 --> 11:25.964
All very noble deaths, I'm sure.

11:25.988 --> 11:29.547
Zephyr Halima, Empire was hoping
to speak frankly with you.

11:30.201 --> 11:33.138
I can appreciate an
aggressive early play.

11:33.162 --> 11:37.768
And, well, you've succeeded in
drawing me down here into the trenches.

11:37.792 --> 11:42.546
So, I applaud you. I'm here.
And I'm listening.

11:43.255 --> 11:46.318
I'm not really sure
what it is you're expecting me to say.

11:46.342 --> 11:48.010
What is your ask?

11:50.179 --> 11:52.532
End the Genetic Dynasty.

11:52.556 --> 11:55.494
If you're only fielding offers,
consider the following.

11:55.518 --> 11:57.496
In addition to the desalination system,

11:57.520 --> 12:00.207
we will also establish
a satellite security station

12:00.231 --> 12:02.250
for the dedicated protection
of your people.

12:02.274 --> 12:05.212
Safety and clean water.

12:05.236 --> 12:07.422
We're misunderstanding
each other here, Cleon.

12:07.446 --> 12:10.092
My ask is not a tactic.

12:10.116 --> 12:12.594
I only preach what I believe.

12:12.618 --> 12:16.431
And I believe the Genetic Dynasty
will be the ruin of us all.

12:16.455 --> 12:18.141
Luminists can see the future now?

12:18.165 --> 12:20.685
I do not claim to see the future.

12:20.709 --> 12:26.358
I only have a sense deep in my soul
of what is true and what is wrong.

12:26.382 --> 12:27.692
Wrong?

12:27.716 --> 12:29.627
You don't even remotely comprehend

12:29.651 --> 12:31.738
what my familial line has accomplished.

12:31.762 --> 12:35.033
- My brothers and I...
- Brothers? You are not brothers.

12:35.057 --> 12:37.744
You are the reverberations
of a dead man's ego,

12:37.768 --> 12:40.831
by nature blind to all that you lack.

12:40.855 --> 12:43.983
The soulless creature
cannot recognize itself.

12:44.942 --> 12:48.362
I believe the late Dr. Seldon
made a similar observation?

12:50.573 --> 12:53.468
If that is truly what you believe,
I am sorry.

12:53.492 --> 12:56.596
You will spend your life
shouting into the void.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.956
The only reason you ventured down here

12:59.874 --> 13:03.461
is because you know
people are listening to me.

13:04.128 --> 13:06.148
I'm sure, in preparation for your visit,

13:06.172 --> 13:08.985
you were counseled as to the staggering

13:09.009 --> 13:11.278
numbers of followers Luminism claims,

13:11.302 --> 13:16.366
all committed to acting
in service of truth's light.

13:16.390 --> 13:20.269
Remind me, how many people did it take
to bring down your Star Bridge?

13:21.061 --> 13:22.289
Are you threatening me?

13:22.313 --> 13:26.609
I'm only trying to answer your question,
to articulate my ask.

13:27.193 --> 13:30.756
I'm not surprised
it's left you confused.

13:30.780 --> 13:33.633
It's about something
much greater than you.

13:33.657 --> 13:37.095
But I'm sure your adviser
will help you to understand.

13:37.119 --> 13:41.369
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have souls that need ministering to.

14:03.938 --> 14:06.875
- Lewis, fall back. Fall back, Lewis.
- What, Salvor?

14:06.899 --> 14:08.877
You and Jacenta are too close.
Two meters!

14:08.901 --> 14:10.528
Oh, sorry.

14:16.784 --> 14:18.494
Take cover!

14:37.596 --> 14:40.700
If I open the doors, the guns will stop.

14:40.724 --> 14:42.435
Commander!

14:56.782 --> 14:58.117
Now!

15:06.375 --> 15:07.668
Come on.

15:27.855 --> 15:29.523
No!

15:33.861 --> 15:35.988
He served his purpose.

16:04.767 --> 16:08.580
Not you, Warden.
You're too dangerous unfettered.

16:08.604 --> 16:10.147
Hold out your hands.

16:16.946 --> 16:17.988
Now, move.

16:37.258 --> 16:38.634
Keep moving.

16:39.426 --> 16:41.554
Atmosphere's frozen.

16:42.054 --> 16:44.362
Must be a hull breach somewhere.

16:44.682 --> 16:46.577
The environmental systems must be off.

16:47.117 --> 16:49.867
We should find a regulation panel.

17:09.957 --> 17:12.333
The regulation panel. Over here.

17:28.642 --> 17:31.020
Okay. The system's archaic.

17:31.687 --> 17:34.148
I'll have to input commands
with manual code.

17:35.649 --> 17:38.712
I've sealed the breach
so it's safe to restore atmosphere.

17:38.736 --> 17:39.820
Do it.

17:42.573 --> 17:45.159
We might have weather in here
as the atmosphere regulates.

17:46.744 --> 17:49.497
And now for the gravity. Heads up.

18:00.758 --> 18:04.654
Those lights, what was that?
Is that a power surge?

18:04.678 --> 18:06.073
I'm not sure.

18:06.097 --> 18:07.407
Now update security protocols.

18:07.431 --> 18:09.493
I want the internal defenses off-line.

18:09.517 --> 18:12.394
Security's a different system.
That'll be closer to the bridge.

18:13.979 --> 18:15.356
Then we head there next.

18:31.997 --> 18:33.304
Sixteen seconds.

18:34.333 --> 18:39.022
Hey, the lights were pulsating
consistently every 18 seconds,

18:39.046 --> 18:40.941
and now it's down to 16.

18:40.965 --> 18:42.842
Okay. So, what does that mean?

18:43.657 --> 18:46.618
- Like a countdown?
- A countdown to what?

18:50.099 --> 18:51.308
The next jump.

18:53.769 --> 18:56.856
Two weeks ago,
my people were out on a scavenging run.

18:57.690 --> 18:59.584
They happened to
see the Invictus jump in.

18:59.608 --> 19:01.878
We think her drives
are cycling on their own,

19:01.902 --> 19:04.089
setting random time intervals
between jumps.

19:04.113 --> 19:07.217
We knew,
if we wanted to get control of the ship,

19:07.241 --> 19:10.137
we had to board
before she could jump away again.

19:10.161 --> 19:11.454
Jump away where?

19:14.623 --> 19:18.937
They have no idea.
That's how the legend started.

19:18.961 --> 19:21.088
That's why the Invictus
became a ghost ship.

19:23.340 --> 19:25.694
The crew must have lost control,

19:25.718 --> 19:28.908
and the ship started jumping from one
random set of coordinates

19:28.932 --> 19:30.181
to the next.

19:31.599 --> 19:35.120
They got marooned
out in the dark deep somewhere,

19:35.144 --> 19:36.729
out of comms range…

19:37.921 --> 19:40.048
Maybe outside the galaxy completely.

19:41.609 --> 19:44.963
They ran out of food,
turned on each other.

19:44.987 --> 19:47.114
How long do we have
before the countdown gets to zero?

19:48.157 --> 19:49.784
At this rate…

19:50.659 --> 19:51.660
Four hours.

19:52.411 --> 19:53.412
Okay.

19:54.705 --> 19:58.667
So we have four hours to get control,
or she blinks away again.

20:16.018 --> 20:17.853
You understand the urgency now.

20:18.729 --> 20:21.124
If we fail and we're lucky,

20:21.148 --> 20:23.025
we end up in the heart of a sun

20:24.610 --> 20:26.570
or staring down the
mouth of a black hole.

20:27.238 --> 20:31.784
If we're unlucky,
we suffer much longer deaths.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.374
What are your feelings about Halima now?

20:40.209 --> 20:41.710
That was reckless.

20:42.670 --> 20:45.273
There's no question in my mind,
that was a threat.

20:45.297 --> 20:47.484
That damn Hari Seldon predicted this.

20:47.508 --> 20:51.470
"An exhortation from
one of the galaxy's major religions."

20:52.012 --> 20:53.152
As to Halima's threat,

20:53.176 --> 20:56.118
I will enhance
the security measures at the palace.

20:56.142 --> 20:58.995
We can assemble a comms team
to contain Halima's message,

20:59.019 --> 21:02.707
data filters triggered by certain
phrases. "Genetic Dynasty."

21:02.731 --> 21:03.792
No.

21:03.816 --> 21:06.902
I refuse to play
defense with this woman.

21:08.028 --> 21:11.991
If she wants to invoke something
greater than me, I'll do the same.

21:13.242 --> 21:16.036
I'll prove both her and Seldon wrong.

21:23.669 --> 21:27.840
According to Zephyr Halima,
I am soulless,

21:28.293 --> 21:31.004
and therefore incapable of growth.

21:31.802 --> 21:32.928
I disagree.

21:33.721 --> 21:37.683
But as she suggests, the soulless
creature cannot recognize itself,

21:38.392 --> 21:42.396
which is why I must appeal to those
with a much broader vantage,

21:43.147 --> 21:45.858
broader even than the zephyrs.

21:46.609 --> 21:51.071
I must appeal
to the Triple Goddesses themselves.

22:02.166 --> 22:04.668
I will walk the great Spiral.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.603
And I will let the Mother,

22:06.627 --> 22:10.071
the Maiden
and the Crone decide what is true,

22:11.383 --> 22:12.718
who is right…

22:15.805 --> 22:17.139
And who is wrong.

23:50.024 --> 23:51.209
How does this work?

23:51.233 --> 23:52.777
I'll show you.

25:05.724 --> 25:07.101
I've brought you something.

25:19.836 --> 25:21.439
Color-correction 'hesives.

25:21.657 --> 25:22.783
So you can see red and green.

25:25.244 --> 25:26.370
Thank you.

25:27.663 --> 25:31.834
But I can't. They'll draw attention.

25:32.585 --> 25:35.254
The others, Brother Dusk, Brother Day,

25:36.130 --> 25:37.131
they can't know.

25:37.715 --> 25:39.675
Maybe you could put them on
when they're not looking.

25:40.384 --> 25:42.011
They're always looking.

25:42.636 --> 25:45.473
And if they start pulling that thread,
it all comes undone.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.185
Yes, Empire.

25:49.977 --> 25:51.187
Please, Azura…

25:53.022 --> 25:54.148
Call me Cleon.

25:56.525 --> 25:59.779
It's not just the color blindness.

26:00.268 --> 26:02.896
My thumbs clasp right over left.

26:04.408 --> 26:07.787
My brothers' clasp left over right.

26:08.496 --> 26:10.539
They love brassica.

26:11.749 --> 26:15.002
I find it so bitter
I can barely stomach it.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.939
I put my shoes on in a different order.

26:17.963 --> 26:20.400
I point at things
with a different crook in my finger.

26:20.424 --> 26:23.612
I eat starches before meats
instead of the other way round.

26:23.636 --> 26:27.306
If they notice the 'hesives,
they might notice all of it.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.559
Would that really be so terrible?

26:36.440 --> 26:37.817
I'll show you.

26:51.705 --> 26:54.351
This is the first.

26:54.375 --> 26:55.626
The Principium.

26:56.710 --> 26:58.838
The Cleon from whom we're all extracted.

27:00.297 --> 27:01.549
There's more.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.644
Are they alive?

27:15.146 --> 27:16.605
In a manner of speaking.

27:25.281 --> 27:26.842
They're absorbing information,

27:26.866 --> 27:29.177
so as to be up to date with our lives

27:29.201 --> 27:30.619
if they're ever needed.

27:31.162 --> 27:33.080
Needed? For what?

27:33.706 --> 27:39.587
If a Cleon is ever damaged or killed,
these are his replacements.

27:55.269 --> 27:57.855
Every moment of my life is a test.

27:59.440 --> 28:04.266
And if I ever fail,
if they ever learn how different I am,

28:05.362 --> 28:06.822
it'll be my last day.

28:09.283 --> 28:10.284
And his first.

28:11.202 --> 28:13.638
But they can't. You're Empire.

28:13.662 --> 28:14.955
No more than he is.

28:16.665 --> 28:20.854
My job, my reason for existing,
is to be a perfect copy.

28:20.878 --> 28:22.505
And if I can't do that, then...

28:26.592 --> 28:29.261
The Empire must be protected
from mistakes.

28:30.513 --> 28:31.597
Like me.

28:32.223 --> 28:34.534
So I can't take your gift, Azura.

28:34.558 --> 28:36.685
They can't know I'm correcting my sight.

28:37.937 --> 28:39.289
I have to blend in,

28:40.715 --> 28:41.745
or I die.

28:42.650 --> 28:45.486
Or you escape. You leave.

28:46.070 --> 28:48.924
They won't care.
They'll just wake up your replacement.

28:48.948 --> 28:51.635
They won't let a rogue Emperor go free.
They'll have me killed.

28:51.659 --> 28:54.262
Then we'll make it
so they can't find you.

28:54.286 --> 28:56.807
I have the most recognizable face
in the galaxy.

28:56.831 --> 28:58.011
Not if we change it.

28:58.499 --> 29:00.018
There are biohackers underground.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.765
They could do it with a single incision.

29:02.984 --> 29:05.695
They'd still track me
through my nanobots.

29:08.801 --> 29:11.053
There are people
who can filter them out.

29:12.012 --> 29:14.515
You think you're the first person
who's wanted them gone?

29:20.354 --> 29:22.648
You showed me this place for a reason.

29:23.774 --> 29:26.193
The same reason
you jumped off your balcony.

29:27.069 --> 29:28.696
You can't live like this.

29:30.489 --> 29:33.659
You've lived every moment of your life
with people watching you.

29:34.869 --> 29:38.873
The Scar's different.
You can lose yourself in it.

29:40.332 --> 29:43.002
For Empire,
the Scar represents a failure.

29:44.712 --> 29:47.673
For the rest of Trantor,
it represents an opportunity.

29:48.466 --> 29:50.619
For the first time in centuries,

29:50.643 --> 29:54.638
we can look up and see real clouds,
real stars,

29:55.514 --> 30:00.102
not a simulation run by servers
designed to keep us complacent.

30:03.230 --> 30:05.083
Will they let me
through security with it?

30:05.107 --> 30:06.150
It's cloaked.

30:16.911 --> 30:19.205
It's nothing like your palace.

30:20.247 --> 30:23.375
It's crowded. It's chaotic.

30:24.293 --> 30:25.544
But it's alive.

30:27.630 --> 30:29.215
And it's waiting for you.

30:30.132 --> 30:31.592
Come with me.

30:42.478 --> 30:44.688
You missed the dinner bell.

30:45.481 --> 30:50.027
- Sorry.
- Punctuality. Routine. Respect.

30:51.153 --> 30:54.174
These may be practiced traits
to the everyman,

30:54.198 --> 30:57.243
but they are innate to a Cleon.

30:57.827 --> 30:59.096
At least, they should be.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.204
Of course.

31:00.999 --> 31:05.128
I was just learning about Trantor.
The rest of it.

31:05.726 --> 31:07.561
We are Trantor.

31:08.462 --> 31:11.715
Nothing outside the palace walls
is relevant.

31:26.920 --> 31:27.962
Hari?

31:30.609 --> 31:32.754
Computer, what am I looking at?

31:32.778 --> 31:35.794
Hari Seldon
Quantum Consciousness Protocol.

31:36.073 --> 31:37.825
It's a projection of some kind.

31:39.410 --> 31:42.431
Computer, identify the issue
with Hari Seldon Protocol.

31:42.455 --> 31:44.516
Incomplete neural uplink.

31:44.540 --> 31:46.178
Help me.

31:46.750 --> 31:48.770
Computer, what was the source of uplink?

31:48.794 --> 31:52.357
Initiated with
Raych Foss Arrival Protocol.

31:52.381 --> 31:53.442
Can you restart it?

31:53.466 --> 31:55.342
Authorization required.

31:56.260 --> 31:59.698
- Hari, can you hear me?
- Help me.

31:59.722 --> 32:04.536
Okay. Listen to me.
Focus on my voice. This is Gaal.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.079
Gaal!

32:06.103 --> 32:09.124
You've digitized your consciousness,
but something went wrong.

32:09.148 --> 32:12.127
You're glitching,
stuck in the loop of the past.

32:12.151 --> 32:13.736
Just concentrate on my voice.

32:14.445 --> 32:16.530
This is the present. This is now.

32:17.256 --> 32:19.609
That's it, Hari. Follow my voice.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.631
That is the past. This is now.

32:31.003 --> 32:32.546
What have you done to yourself, Hari?

32:33.130 --> 32:37.009
I had a data unit implanted in my brain
before we left Trantor…

32:38.552 --> 32:40.906
Synced to a port
hidden in Raych's knife.

32:40.930 --> 32:42.428
Recorded all my thoughts,

32:42.452 --> 32:45.363
memories,
everything, right up to the moment I...

32:46.936 --> 32:48.646
Something must've gone wrong.

32:49.939 --> 32:51.249
Where am I?

32:51.273 --> 32:54.669
On a ship called the Raven,
headed to Helicon,

32:54.693 --> 32:55.921
your homeworld, Hari.

32:55.945 --> 32:57.446
Helicon. Yes.

33:00.189 --> 33:01.190
How long?

33:03.619 --> 33:05.329
Thirty-four years.

33:09.333 --> 33:11.377
You're not supposed to be here.

33:12.670 --> 33:13.671
Where's Raych?

33:14.672 --> 33:16.358
He sent me instead.

33:16.382 --> 33:19.361
He wouldn't do that. You're supposed to
lead the First Foundation.

33:19.551 --> 33:20.719
He knew that.

33:21.095 --> 33:23.321
They'll be facing
their first crisis soon.

33:23.345 --> 33:24.366
Who's in charge?

33:24.390 --> 33:26.535
Lewis Pirenne, I'd imagine.

33:26.988 --> 33:28.620
He'll get them
through the settlement stage,

33:28.644 --> 33:31.081
but for what's coming next,
they'll need someone else, you.

33:31.105 --> 33:32.744
Raych knew that. Where's Raych?

33:33.482 --> 33:35.609
It's hard to explain.

33:37.653 --> 33:39.780
You're dead, Hari.

33:42.541 --> 33:43.709
You know that, right?

33:46.829 --> 33:48.223
Raych murdered you.

33:48.247 --> 33:49.594
They think I helped him.

33:50.541 --> 33:51.685
What? Why?

33:51.709 --> 33:55.392
I went to your cabin. Interrupted him.

33:56.088 --> 34:00.092
I saw him bent over you
with the knife in your chest.

34:00.676 --> 34:04.990
He threw me in the lifeboat
and stayed behind.

34:05.014 --> 34:06.324
What happened to him?

34:06.348 --> 34:07.946
They executed him.

34:08.768 --> 34:10.478
Raych is dead?

34:12.438 --> 34:13.773
Why, Hari?

34:15.441 --> 34:18.986
Hari? Why did he do it?

34:19.945 --> 34:20.988
Hari?

34:23.657 --> 34:25.075
Hari!

34:35.294 --> 34:38.689
We're running out of time.
We need to make a move. Now.

34:38.713 --> 34:41.276
We take their weapons,
level the playing field.

34:41.300 --> 34:43.677
I'm not a fighter. None of us are.

34:44.260 --> 34:47.515
Most people aren't, until they're left
with no other choice.

34:48.182 --> 34:49.224
Stop!

35:04.698 --> 35:06.075
An energy barrier.

35:08.494 --> 35:11.205
It's gotta be a tech precursor
to our fence on Terminus.

35:11.831 --> 35:14.500
I'm the only expert here
who can safely override it.

35:15.918 --> 35:17.586
But you'll need to uncuff me.

35:21.507 --> 35:23.193
Do it, Warden.

35:23.217 --> 35:24.552
Or we all die for nothing.

35:44.511 --> 35:47.712
That's it. We're all coded in.

36:08.846 --> 36:10.514
Fifteen seconds.

36:12.183 --> 36:14.703
Cuffs back on. Hold out your hands.

36:14.727 --> 36:15.895
What is this?

36:16.604 --> 36:20.287
The older ships used cooling
tanks for the jumpdrives. Careful.

36:20.900 --> 36:22.026
Stop stalling.

36:34.747 --> 36:36.415
Keep moving.

36:48.719 --> 36:49.887
Lewis!

37:12.284 --> 37:13.410
No! No!

37:29.051 --> 37:30.737
No, Phara.

37:30.761 --> 37:32.067
We still need her.

37:33.578 --> 37:37.248
There might be more barriers,
security protocols to override.

37:44.567 --> 37:46.402
Rowan, please.

37:47.194 --> 37:50.424
We're losing all our experts,
and we're running out of time.

37:50.448 --> 37:53.718
You wanna live to carry out
your strike against the Empire?

37:53.742 --> 37:55.887
You're not gonna do it
if you stay on board this ship.

37:55.911 --> 37:57.634
I'm never leaving the Invictus.

37:58.706 --> 38:00.124
And neither are you.

38:04.336 --> 38:07.649
You're gonna help us redirect the ship
before she jumps again.

38:07.673 --> 38:11.051
And then we'll guide it
right into the beating heart of Trantor.

38:13.846 --> 38:16.223
The Empire won't have a chance to run,

38:17.433 --> 38:19.226
just like my people did not.

38:21.103 --> 38:25.292
All of Trantor will be nothing
but a heap of poisonous ash,

38:25.316 --> 38:28.611
all its evils rendered silent
underneath it.

38:29.445 --> 38:32.090
We will deliver that justice to them,
Warden.

38:32.114 --> 38:37.411
We will die
to bring the Empire to its knees.

38:56.305 --> 38:58.307
Oxygen level at 2%.

38:58.974 --> 38:59.975
Hari?

39:01.060 --> 39:03.187
The ship's shut down without you.

39:04.563 --> 39:06.190
Temperature's dropped.

39:08.025 --> 39:10.337
I don't think I'll be able
to breathe much longer.

39:10.361 --> 39:13.572
Please authorize
reinstatement of life support systems.

39:18.369 --> 39:21.831
Please authorize
reinstatement of life support systems.

39:25.334 --> 39:26.335
Hari?

39:27.503 --> 39:29.731
- Please authorize reinstatement…
- Hari, please.

39:29.755 --> 39:32.275
- …of life support systems.
- Please, Hari. Please.

39:32.299 --> 39:33.676
Please. Please.

39:41.392 --> 39:43.144
Authorization complete.

40:02.955 --> 40:05.725
I owe you an explanation, Gaal.

40:05.749 --> 40:07.686
I recognize that now.

40:07.710 --> 40:09.271
Why did Raych do it?

40:09.295 --> 40:11.755
I don't understand. Why did he kill you?

40:12.111 --> 40:16.300
My death was an essential element
to the success of the Plan.

40:16.552 --> 40:18.196
Don't understand.

40:18.220 --> 40:21.783
The Foundation needs
more than a man to inspire it.

40:21.807 --> 40:24.977
It needs a myth
that can endure for centuries.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.082
And it worked.

40:29.106 --> 40:32.693
Do you remember what our mortality
projections had been for Terminus?

40:35.070 --> 40:37.424
34.2%.

40:37.448 --> 40:39.492
The actual rate was nearly half that.

40:40.284 --> 40:42.637
My death galvanized the Foundation.

40:42.661 --> 40:45.915
The Foundation isn't a religion, Hari.

40:46.499 --> 40:47.559
And you're not a god.

40:47.583 --> 40:50.544
No. Gods are impervious to knives.

40:51.504 --> 40:55.257
But you can kill them.
You just stop believing in them.

40:56.675 --> 41:00.363
I don't buy it.
I mean, you're egotistical,

41:00.387 --> 41:03.590
but I can't see you
sacrificing your life

41:03.614 --> 41:05.285
just to turn yourself into this.

41:05.309 --> 41:07.770
- Why not just wait until...
- I have Lethe Syndrome.

41:09.188 --> 41:11.333
Had Lethe Syndrome.

41:11.357 --> 41:12.900
Inherited from my father.

41:13.484 --> 41:17.297
Once the symptoms manifest,
the cognitive decline is steep.

41:17.321 --> 41:18.840
Think it through.

41:18.864 --> 41:21.259
We reach Terminus,
face famine and the elements,

41:21.283 --> 41:23.345
but I'm no longer
the hand of our salvation,

41:23.369 --> 41:26.288
but the crackpot who dragged
everyone to a frigid rock.

41:26.997 --> 41:29.976
But you told me it was your dream
to see Terminus.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.504
You said you wanted to
start the Foundation together.

41:34.088 --> 41:35.690
Yes.

41:35.714 --> 41:38.819
I said it loudly and often, didn't I?

41:38.843 --> 41:41.178
So often I started to bore myself.

41:42.263 --> 41:43.532
You were performing.

41:43.556 --> 41:45.992
I was engineering the narrative.

41:46.016 --> 41:48.018
That's a fancy way of saying you lied.

41:49.895 --> 41:51.522
Approaching debris disk.

42:01.365 --> 42:04.618
Helicon. Home.

42:06.412 --> 42:07.889
The debris field surrounds…

42:07.913 --> 42:09.623
Helicon's dark star.

42:10.624 --> 42:13.335
It's kept your homeworld hidden
all these years.

42:14.128 --> 42:19.008
I know where we are, Hari.
It's the why I'm struggling with.

42:20.259 --> 42:23.155
Did Raych know about this?
Your death? This ship?

42:23.179 --> 42:24.889
Raych knew everything.

42:25.973 --> 42:27.783
I was gonna take my life.

42:27.807 --> 42:30.603
He was gonna stay behind to explain why…

42:31.187 --> 42:36.329
Then, a week or so later,
disappear and reunite with me here.

42:38.861 --> 42:41.405
He loved you. That wasn't a lie.

42:43.741 --> 42:45.761
You should've warned me.

42:45.785 --> 42:47.036
Would you have listened?

42:47.787 --> 42:50.998
I am so tired of this.

42:51.776 --> 42:55.696
You deciding what I need to know
when I need to know it.

42:57.505 --> 42:59.215
What changed your plan?

43:00.090 --> 43:02.676
- You really need me to answer that?
- Tell me.

43:03.469 --> 43:05.554
He wasn't ever going to leave you.

43:08.140 --> 43:10.309
So you made Raych kill you.

43:11.602 --> 43:13.521
That way he would have to leave me.

43:15.397 --> 43:17.334
- You used him.
- That's unfair.

43:17.358 --> 43:18.460
You used both of us.

43:18.484 --> 43:20.444
Raych was always meant to be here.

43:21.028 --> 43:22.798
Not you. Raych.

43:22.822 --> 43:25.342
You were meant to stay on Terminus,
to lead Terminus.

43:25.366 --> 43:27.014
Exactly!

43:27.038 --> 43:29.429
There was never a version of your plan

43:29.453 --> 43:32.468
where Raych and I were within
light-years of each other.

43:32.957 --> 43:37.765
You didn't care about what we wanted,
as long as your plan was safe!

43:38.129 --> 43:40.518
You're too smart to play the victim,
Gaal.

43:41.882 --> 43:45.570
You welcomed your part in this
the moment you solved Abraxas.

43:45.594 --> 43:46.655
I what?

43:46.679 --> 43:49.199
You could've submitted the answer
anonymously.

43:49.223 --> 43:51.868
You chose recognition.

43:51.892 --> 43:54.454
No one forced you to come to Trantor.

43:54.478 --> 43:56.206
I came under false pretenses.

43:56.230 --> 43:59.084
You came knowing full well
the attention it would bring you

43:59.108 --> 44:01.444
and the danger that put your family in.

44:02.361 --> 44:04.423
You made a choice, Gaal.

44:04.447 --> 44:07.134
You wanted a different life
to the one mapped out for you.

44:07.158 --> 44:09.177
When we were hauled up
in front of the Emperor,

44:09.201 --> 44:11.287
you made a choice to lie to him.

44:12.037 --> 44:16.184
"If you kill me, the fall accelerates."
Isn't that what you told him?

44:16.208 --> 44:18.919
Fine. We're both hypocrites.

44:19.545 --> 44:22.607
If this was really only about
the path psychohistory laid out,

44:22.631 --> 44:25.718
then you would've let Cleon kill you
in that throne room.

44:26.427 --> 44:28.113
Your followers would've been exiled,

44:28.137 --> 44:30.639
and everything would've
fallen into place as planned.

44:31.974 --> 44:33.309
That's true.

44:34.643 --> 44:36.496
So why didn't you?

44:36.520 --> 44:37.646
I wanted to live.

44:38.689 --> 44:40.608
Well, so did Raych.

44:42.088 --> 44:47.877
Now I'm here instead of on Terminus,
and Raych is dead.

44:48.741 --> 44:51.827
- And that's on you. Not me.
- Is it?

44:52.995 --> 44:55.432
Don't you dare put this on me.

44:55.456 --> 44:58.459
You weren't supposed to be
anywhere near my cabin the night I died.

44:59.919 --> 45:01.563
You were meant to be swimming.

45:01.587 --> 45:05.358
Every night, 40 lengths of the pool.
Counting primes like clockwork.

45:05.382 --> 45:07.009
I've heard enough from you.

45:11.514 --> 45:13.075
I liked you better when you were dying.

45:13.099 --> 45:16.703
- You came to my cabin. Why?
- I was worried about Raych.

45:16.727 --> 45:19.414
- So why not go to his?
- I did. He wasn't there.

45:19.438 --> 45:21.482
- Then what happened?
- I don't know. I...

45:23.317 --> 45:25.170
Computer, divert from the debris field.

45:25.194 --> 45:27.422
Authorization required.

45:27.446 --> 45:29.174
Something is going to pierce the hull.

45:29.198 --> 45:31.843
Hari, if you're in the mainframe,
you can turn us around.

45:31.867 --> 45:33.386
The shields are strong.

45:33.410 --> 45:35.305
Any micro-breaches
will seal automatically.

45:35.329 --> 45:37.140
Turn us around. This is too much.

45:37.164 --> 45:39.267
- Why did you break your routine?
- I can't...

45:39.291 --> 45:41.269
Why did you get out of that pool?

45:41.293 --> 45:42.938
I know what you're trying to do.

45:42.962 --> 45:45.649
You were worried about Raych.
You went to his cabin.

45:45.673 --> 45:47.424
He wasn't there. Then what happened?

45:48.884 --> 45:52.596
86,981,803.

45:55.307 --> 45:56.701
I could feel it in the air.

45:56.725 --> 46:00.288
86,981,821.

46:00.312 --> 46:02.958
A sense of doom.

46:02.982 --> 46:04.668
I just... I had a feeling.

46:04.692 --> 46:06.670
86,981,827.

46:06.694 --> 46:09.047
What kind of a feeling?
A memory? A vision? What?

46:09.071 --> 46:10.459
A compulsion?

46:13.451 --> 46:15.595
Like my body knew
something before I did.

46:15.619 --> 46:17.675
Hari, the sky.

46:18.539 --> 46:20.892
Like knowing the Star Bridge would fall.

46:20.916 --> 46:23.228
Like knowing
when they'd come to arrest me.

46:23.252 --> 46:24.462
How are you awake?

46:25.045 --> 46:26.606
Did you say something?

46:26.630 --> 46:28.525
No. But I was going to ask...

46:28.549 --> 46:31.027
Someone would speak before they did.

46:31.051 --> 46:33.029
The prodigy speaks.

46:33.053 --> 46:35.198
86,981,000...

46:35.222 --> 46:36.908
We're all different, Ms. Dornick.

46:36.932 --> 46:39.286
And if you don't know what it is,
I urge you to figure it out

46:39.310 --> 46:42.080
before someone else does
and uses it against you.

46:42.104 --> 46:44.624
86,981,827.

46:44.648 --> 46:45.751
Terminus.

46:45.775 --> 46:46.954
You're exiling us.

46:47.568 --> 46:49.206
Did you say something?

46:50.070 --> 46:51.906
The prodigy speaks.

46:52.406 --> 46:54.551
You're exiling us.

46:54.575 --> 46:55.796
I'm sorry.

46:56.619 --> 46:57.912
How are you awake?

46:59.330 --> 47:01.016
Did you say something?

47:01.040 --> 47:02.750
- I'm sorry.
- You're exiling us.

47:03.709 --> 47:05.854
- How are you awake?
- I'm sorry.

47:05.878 --> 47:07.463
Did you say something?

47:18.599 --> 47:22.073
That's why I came to your cabin.
That's what you couldn't predict.

47:23.896 --> 47:27.108
I knew what was gonna happen
before it did.

47:27.858 --> 47:30.539
Not through math,
not through calculations…

47:32.488 --> 47:34.198
I think I can feel the future.
