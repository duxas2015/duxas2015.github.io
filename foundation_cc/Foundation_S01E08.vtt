02:26.291 --> 02:27.709
Ilex!

02:34.925 --> 02:37.302
<i>After they were gone,
there were no children left.</i>

02:38.178 --> 02:39.680
<i>Only warriors.</i>

02:40.556 --> 02:42.487
I pushed this scarred body of mine

02:42.511 --> 02:45.524
till
I was named the Grand Huntress of War.

02:47.646 --> 02:51.567
I outlived my life's expectancy
three times over.

02:51.650 --> 02:55.904
The Weald Gods wouldn't let me die
till I got my revenge.

02:58.073 --> 02:59.366
And when I was ready…

03:01.201 --> 03:02.953
They sent me a second gift.

03:03.036 --> 03:04.455
The <i>Invictus</i>?

03:04.538 --> 03:06.790
It blinked into orbit like a prayer.

03:07.875 --> 03:09.334
And I knew then…

03:09.418 --> 03:13.046
…the gods did not just approve of
my mission to destroy the Empire,

03:13.756 --> 03:14.798
they engineered it.

03:14.882 --> 03:16.800
You saw what happened to your people.

03:18.635 --> 03:23.807
For the sins of a few,
the Empire wiped out half your world.

03:24.391 --> 03:28.395
If you strike at Trantor,
the entire Outer Reach will suffer.

03:28.479 --> 03:30.856
You simply have no concept of revenge,
do you?

03:32.399 --> 03:34.448
I don't care about mankind.

03:36.862 --> 03:40.115
This ship is going to be my voice.

03:41.338 --> 03:44.383
You will help me navigate its next jump.

03:46.872 --> 03:48.165
And if you don't,

03:49.625 --> 03:51.627
my hunters will kill every man,

03:52.711 --> 03:57.466
woman and child left on Terminus,

03:57.549 --> 03:59.051
starting with your mother.

04:04.431 --> 04:06.396
You already sacrificed your father.

04:07.601 --> 04:09.566
You wouldn't sacrifice her as well.

04:11.271 --> 04:13.695
The trade-off is simple, Warden.

04:16.652 --> 04:17.986
Destroy Trantor…

04:19.196 --> 04:23.242
And maybe, just maybe,

04:24.243 --> 04:27.704
your precious Foundation survives
what comes after.

04:30.541 --> 04:33.757
Isn't it remarkable
what a person will do for a little time?

05:02.030 --> 05:04.037
How long have you been able to do this?

05:05.325 --> 05:06.952
As long as I can remember.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.912
Most of the time it's just a feeling.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.381
Like with this, but…

05:16.253 --> 05:18.172
Other times it comes in dreams.

05:20.646 --> 05:22.522
I used to dream about a wave.

05:23.761 --> 05:25.012
<i>A wave so big…</i>

05:25.637 --> 05:31.189
All I could do was hold my breath
and let it take me.

05:32.227 --> 05:37.775
I knew it would crush my home,
my family, my whole world.

05:39.860 --> 05:42.905
I could never get rid of that dream,
Hari.

05:44.782 --> 05:46.116
It haunted me.

05:46.413 --> 05:49.203
I needed to know that
it wasn't going to happen in real life,

05:49.286 --> 05:52.206
so I taught myself math.

05:52.289 --> 05:56.210
I calculated every probability
and physical force I could think of,

05:56.293 --> 05:58.175
desperate to see a way around it.

06:02.172 --> 06:03.673
But I couldn't find one.

06:04.927 --> 06:07.638
That dream drove you to mathematics,

06:07.721 --> 06:10.933
which only proved it wasn't
a dream at all, but a premonition.

06:12.017 --> 06:13.310
I wouldn't be surprised to learn

06:13.393 --> 06:16.271
that you have some sort of
intuitive processing ability

06:16.355 --> 06:17.815
that puts you ahead of the math.

06:18.565 --> 06:20.025
It would explain Abraxas.

06:21.652 --> 06:24.988
I solved Abraxas
because I worked my ass off.

06:25.072 --> 06:27.866
Yes, I'm saying you're extraordinary.

06:33.330 --> 06:35.707
It's getting hotter.

06:35.791 --> 06:37.960
Friction as we enter the debris field.

06:38.043 --> 06:40.587
The ship's radiators
will bleed off the heat.

06:40.671 --> 06:43.674
<i>Initiating
heat transfer system. Stabilizing.</i>

06:45.050 --> 06:46.802
Why are you going to Helicon, Hari?

06:47.302 --> 06:48.804
What were you and Raych planning?

06:49.304 --> 06:50.848
I've already told you.

06:50.931 --> 06:52.724
No, I made a supposition
which you didn't deny.

06:52.808 --> 06:53.851
Because you were right.

06:54.643 --> 06:56.812
Are you really going to continue
keeping me in the dark?

06:56.895 --> 06:59.398
One could argue
I should've done so from the beginning.

06:59.481 --> 07:01.108
What's that supposed to mean?

07:01.666 --> 07:02.793
If we're not careful,

07:02.818 --> 07:05.077
this prescience of
yours has the potential

07:05.101 --> 07:07.448
to skew psychohistory completely.

07:07.531 --> 07:09.450
Look what happened to you and Raych.

07:09.533 --> 07:11.452
You're here, he's not.

07:12.745 --> 07:14.997
That didn't come out right.
Let me take that back.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.040
What I'm trying to say

07:17.124 --> 07:21.336
is that mankind's survival
is predicated on us reaching Helicon.

07:21.420 --> 07:24.423
I thought our survival
depended on the Foundation.

07:24.506 --> 07:26.471
It is, to an extent.

07:29.845 --> 07:33.682
But only if its sister organization is
established as well.

07:33.766 --> 07:35.809
So it is a second Foundation.

07:35.893 --> 07:40.402
Here, at Star's End. On Helicon.

08:48.632 --> 08:51.802
This is Hugo Crast...

08:51.885 --> 08:52.970
This is Cian un Edan,

08:54.341 --> 08:56.468
former citizen of Thespis,

08:58.004 --> 09:01.399
sending an SOS to the Thespin Republic.

09:02.502 --> 09:07.238
Anacreon activity to
report at outpost 59.

09:09.486 --> 09:10.988
Does anyone read me?

09:13.027 --> 09:14.487
Does anyone read me?

09:18.036 --> 09:19.163
Does anyone read me?

09:59.536 --> 10:01.705
<i>The Spiral is designed to push the body</i>

10:01.729 --> 10:03.540
<i>to the limits of its endurance.</i>

10:03.624 --> 10:09.129
A trek of over 170 kilometers
with no food, no water and no rest.

10:09.452 --> 10:11.162
Vital signs are optimal.

10:13.467 --> 10:17.054
<i>And, of course, you must
leave any inorganic devices behind.</i>

10:17.721 --> 10:18.931
<i>Your protective aura…</i>

10:31.026 --> 10:32.991
And your imperial nanobots.

10:36.740 --> 10:40.415
<i>For the first time in your life,
you will be subject to injury,</i>

10:40.994 --> 10:42.955
- exhaustion...
- I understand.

10:43.038 --> 10:44.832
In the event that a pilgrim falters,

10:44.915 --> 10:47.459
<i>he may receive help
from another person on the path.</i>

10:47.543 --> 10:50.129
That is,
if he has only fallen to one knee.

10:51.296 --> 10:54.716
If both knees should drop,
this is a signal of submission.

10:55.884 --> 10:59.346
The pilgrim must either find the
strength to crawl away from the path,

10:59.430 --> 11:01.603
<i>or he must yield to death.</i>

11:03.392 --> 11:07.146
<i>Less than half of those who start
will reach the center of the Spiral.</i>

11:07.229 --> 11:10.779
<i>There, they will enter a sacred cave,
the Mother's Womb.</i>

11:11.525 --> 11:13.198
There is water inside the Womb.

11:13.652 --> 11:16.572
The salt around the pool has
a particular ionic charge

11:16.655 --> 11:20.367
which elicits a singular reaction
in anyone who touches it.

11:20.451 --> 11:26.039
After you immerse yourself in the pool,
if the Mother is willing,

11:26.665 --> 11:28.333
you will be graced with a vision.

11:29.334 --> 11:31.170
If you're successful and you return,

11:31.837 --> 11:34.757
a panel of Zephyrs will interpret
what you have seen.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.341
What have other pilgrims seen?

11:36.842 --> 11:39.595
Every vision is unique
and deeply personal.

11:40.179 --> 11:42.890
I'm surprised they're not
all just hallucinating about food.

11:44.266 --> 11:45.855
Nanobot removal complete.

11:47.936 --> 11:51.231
This gambit will put you
at serious risk, Empire.

11:51.815 --> 11:54.443
In addition
to unprecedented physical danger,

11:54.526 --> 11:55.903
if...

11:55.986 --> 11:57.988
If you're unable to make it to the end,

11:58.072 --> 12:00.240
that will only embolden your critics.

12:00.783 --> 12:02.201
I will make it to the end.

12:06.663 --> 12:08.165
Give me your salt bracelet.

12:26.683 --> 12:27.893
I'm taking this.

12:30.104 --> 12:32.189
It'll be as though
you're right there with me.

12:33.273 --> 12:35.192
As you always have been.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.336
In faith. Take it slow.

13:38.213 --> 13:40.048
These middle rings can be deceptive.

13:40.924 --> 13:42.926
Make us think
we're further along than we are.

13:44.136 --> 13:46.346
Just be sure you've got
some fuel left in the tank.

13:46.889 --> 13:48.098
Done this before?

13:48.807 --> 13:52.352
No, no. But I've talked
to a number of people who have.

13:57.107 --> 13:58.901
Any other useful tips to impart?

13:59.651 --> 14:02.071
There's no way to make it easy.

14:02.738 --> 14:04.114
That's kind of the point.

14:04.990 --> 14:06.408
Just pace yourself.

14:07.534 --> 14:09.119
One foot in front of the other.

14:09.828 --> 14:11.622
The Triple Goddess will guide you.

14:13.832 --> 14:16.752
Did these people talk
about their visions?

14:21.340 --> 14:24.009
One pilgrim did tell me

14:24.093 --> 14:26.720
how the salt around the pool started
to swirl

14:26.744 --> 14:29.727
and shift right before her eyes.

14:30.724 --> 14:32.184
She didn't say what happened next,

14:32.267 --> 14:35.187
but she said it was the most
beautiful thing she'd ever seen.

14:40.818 --> 14:43.987
- Where are you from?
- Baltaros. You?

14:44.071 --> 14:47.408
- Nishaya.
- The manufacturing planet.

14:47.491 --> 14:51.745
Hmm. Whatever's too toxic to make
right on Trantor, that's what we do.

14:52.830 --> 14:54.331
Speciality textiles.

14:54.979 --> 14:58.358
Certain kinds of ceramic glazes
the Empire favors.

14:59.878 --> 15:01.088
Nishaya's the perfect place,

15:01.171 --> 15:03.924
because our atmosphere is
all this thick white fog,

15:04.007 --> 15:08.095
and, well,
the pollution just sort of blends.

15:09.763 --> 15:11.140
That fog.

15:11.765 --> 15:12.766
My mother used to say

15:12.850 --> 15:15.686
that by the time she finally got
her first good look at my dad's face…

15:16.353 --> 15:18.647
They'd already had three kids together.

15:20.023 --> 15:22.526
Did you work in one of these factories?

15:22.609 --> 15:24.695
No. I was a loader.

15:25.487 --> 15:27.114
Loading boxes onto jumpships.

15:27.197 --> 15:28.198
Mmm.

15:29.867 --> 15:31.994
Magnificent machines, aren't they?

15:32.077 --> 15:33.078
Oh, sure.

15:33.704 --> 15:36.248
Of course, I'd never actually been
on one till I came here.

15:36.999 --> 15:39.126
Used all my savings to book my passage.

15:40.919 --> 15:44.089
From Baltaros?
You must have taken one as well.

15:44.173 --> 15:45.174
Yes.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.927
Also my first time.

15:50.971 --> 15:52.164
I used to be jealous of people

15:52.188 --> 15:53.724
who got to travel all the time,

15:53.807 --> 15:55.934
jumping from
one end of the galaxy to the next.

15:56.518 --> 16:01.356
But this… this is the only journey
I ever really needed to make.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.735
I hope you feel the same.

16:07.279 --> 16:08.530
<i>A second Foundation?</i>

16:08.614 --> 16:11.533
Terminus was established
via Imperial charter

16:11.617 --> 16:14.661
and was, in part, designed to draw fire.

16:15.245 --> 16:19.249
But the Second Foundation
and its location must be kept secret,

16:20.793 --> 16:22.461
even from the first Foundation.

16:23.212 --> 16:25.051
Why? What's its purpose?

16:28.008 --> 16:31.220
If you're not willing to trust me,
then I am not going to Helicon.

16:32.179 --> 16:33.643
Don't be ridiculous, Gaal.

16:34.223 --> 16:36.892
I have resources on Helicon. Allies.

16:36.975 --> 16:39.853
Now that we know the nature
of your abilities, we could study them.

16:39.937 --> 16:41.313
Use them to our advantage.

16:41.397 --> 16:44.024
I am done being used.

16:44.775 --> 16:47.736
I want off. Now.

16:47.820 --> 16:51.824
Either you tell me,
or I will leave the same way I came.

16:56.954 --> 16:58.080
Where will you go?

16:58.163 --> 17:00.249
Terminus will take decades.

17:00.332 --> 17:02.584
Trantor?
You'll be banished by the Empire.

17:02.668 --> 17:05.337
There are more worlds than that.
My mother taught me their names.

17:09.465 --> 17:11.844
You told me my instincts are important.

17:12.386 --> 17:14.096
Well, they're telling me.

17:14.179 --> 17:16.223
Open the goddamn door.

17:16.306 --> 17:20.269
- You're not thinking clearly.
- Don't tell me what I think.

17:20.712 --> 17:22.214
Open it.

17:26.650 --> 17:28.448
Open it!

17:29.528 --> 17:33.282
Open!

17:33.365 --> 17:35.329
Open the door!

18:41.975 --> 18:45.274
Don't give up yet, son.
We're getting close.

18:56.216 --> 18:57.417
Yes.

19:05.712 --> 19:10.091
Thirty...
No, 29 minutes till the next jump.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.552
Her plan...

19:17.970 --> 19:19.430
Even if you succeed,

19:21.306 --> 19:23.642
the Empire will slaughter
the rest of your people.

19:24.435 --> 19:26.395
And it won't be a
half measure this time.

19:28.439 --> 19:29.606
They'll kill everyone.

19:31.233 --> 19:33.152
And in the chaos that follows…

19:35.320 --> 19:36.613
They'll all be forgotten.

19:38.782 --> 19:42.453
I know Phara sees herself as a hand
reaching out of Anacreon's grave…

19:44.788 --> 19:47.374
But Anacreon children are
still being born today.

19:52.296 --> 19:53.881
You have a child of your own, don't you?

19:56.049 --> 19:57.176
A little girl.

19:59.595 --> 20:01.847
- It feels like a little girl.
- How are you doing this?

20:01.930 --> 20:04.604
Phara didn't tell you?
People are open books to me.

20:06.560 --> 20:09.146
All I read in her was darkness.

20:09.368 --> 20:11.579
But I read doubt inside you.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.569
There's still a path
forward for Anacreon.

20:16.445 --> 20:18.363
Isn't that a better way
to pay back all the dead?

20:19.573 --> 20:21.950
- Take cover!
- Jacenta?

20:22.034 --> 20:23.660
Oh!

20:26.497 --> 20:27.498
Damn this ship.

20:28.624 --> 20:29.833
Rowan.

20:44.807 --> 20:45.978
This was a mutiny.

20:47.355 --> 20:50.191
The officers must have positioned
the gun to guard the bridge.

20:57.528 --> 20:59.029
You.

20:59.113 --> 21:00.864
You're gonna draw its fire
while I disable it.

21:00.948 --> 21:01.949
What if you miss?

21:02.574 --> 21:03.617
Then you'll die.

21:24.638 --> 21:25.806
Time's running out, Warden.

22:07.598 --> 22:11.226
- Lucky shot.
- You do luck, I do skill.

22:11.935 --> 22:13.061
Another barrier.

22:15.481 --> 22:16.648
You know the drill.

22:43.717 --> 22:45.385
- Get down!
- Lewis!

22:55.854 --> 22:57.314
Come on.

22:57.398 --> 22:59.316
Won't take them long
to get through those doors.

23:08.283 --> 23:09.535
Override the door.

23:15.791 --> 23:17.209
We're running out of time!

23:47.197 --> 23:48.494
Captain killed herself.

23:50.367 --> 23:51.577
"Exo."

23:52.703 --> 23:55.622
Like, executive officer?

23:55.706 --> 23:58.417
Was she betrayed by someone
in her command?

23:58.500 --> 24:00.919
Exo also means "from outside."

24:01.795 --> 24:03.175
Outside the galaxy?

24:05.174 --> 24:07.176
You think they encountered something
out there?

24:16.018 --> 24:17.478
Individual work pods.

24:20.064 --> 24:21.610
One of these controls navigation.

24:23.025 --> 24:26.945
If we can find it, we have a shot
at redirecting the next jump.

24:27.029 --> 24:28.030
Weapons?

24:28.864 --> 24:30.074
Not a weapon.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.284
Propulsion.

24:33.077 --> 24:35.204
They must have jumped
too far away to resupply.

24:36.747 --> 24:39.666
Just started jumping farther out
and farther out.

24:39.750 --> 24:43.212
<i>Warning.
Trans-spatial event in 20 minutes.</i>

24:44.421 --> 24:46.799
<i>Initiate transit protocols.</i>

24:46.882 --> 24:47.883
Now I get it.

24:47.966 --> 24:49.885
What, the lights are what?
Transit protocols?

24:49.968 --> 24:51.720
This ship doesn't have any Spacers.

24:51.804 --> 24:54.523
Without them, the crew members must have
had to sedate themselves

24:54.547 --> 24:55.808
before the jump.

24:56.308 --> 24:59.269
The lights told them how long
they had to reach a jump cradle.

24:59.353 --> 25:00.566
We're running out of time.

25:01.438 --> 25:02.439
Over there.

25:10.864 --> 25:13.704
This is it. The navigation cradle.

25:14.576 --> 25:15.994
Before the Empire had Spacers,

25:16.078 --> 25:19.081
these older ships needed something
with massive processing power

25:19.164 --> 25:20.457
to navigate their jumps.

25:20.541 --> 25:24.086
See, folding space is
as much intuition as it is science.

25:25.546 --> 25:26.964
It's like making a wish.

25:27.047 --> 25:30.968
A cognitive leap that only
a... a living brain can perform.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.011
The difference is,

25:33.095 --> 25:35.681
Spacers were genetically engineered
to withstand the strain,

25:35.764 --> 25:39.685
but these unaugmented humans,
they didn't have that advantage.

25:42.104 --> 25:43.448
In order to survive…

25:46.282 --> 25:51.325
They had to be hardwired
directly into the ships.

25:53.991 --> 25:56.830
He was shot.
The ship was searching for him.

25:58.829 --> 26:00.501
Unable to navigate on its own.

26:08.255 --> 26:10.469
Could someone jack
in without the surgery?

26:13.427 --> 26:14.720
If the AI's intuitive,

26:16.263 --> 26:18.348
wouldn't the interface seek out
the right neurons?

26:18.432 --> 26:22.269
Oh, yes. Maybe.
But they wouldn't survive for long.

26:24.521 --> 26:25.939
Long enough to control the jump?

26:29.818 --> 26:31.487
To make sure the Foundation survives?

26:31.570 --> 26:33.489
A single jump into empty space?

26:36.533 --> 26:38.205
Maybe, but…

26:38.952 --> 26:40.541
It would be a death sentence.

26:42.706 --> 26:44.792
Well, if one of us
is gonna sacrifice ourselves,

26:44.875 --> 26:46.293
it might as well be the outlier.

26:46.835 --> 26:48.045
Help me figure out how.

26:51.507 --> 26:53.008
But not to empty space.

26:55.761 --> 26:57.679
I'm gonna take this
ship home to Terminus.

27:40.190 --> 27:42.734
This one wants
to speak to you, Lieutenant.

27:45.477 --> 27:47.206
Lieutenant Freestone, we have a problem.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.225
That thing out there?

27:48.272 --> 27:50.232
We call it the Vault.
We don't know what it is,

27:50.315 --> 27:52.860
just that it's surrounded by a
signal field that makes people sick.

27:52.943 --> 27:55.199
You start seeing double
and eventually go unconscious.

27:55.696 --> 27:58.907
Your Huntress experienced its effects.

27:58.991 --> 28:00.909
That's how my daughter
was able to capture her.

28:00.993 --> 28:02.327
We don't know the long-term effect,

28:02.411 --> 28:05.539
but the field surrounding it
is getting larger.

28:05.622 --> 28:07.002
We have to evacuate.

28:08.525 --> 28:09.734
This isn't a trick.

28:10.919 --> 28:13.505
The null field doesn't give a damn
what planet you're from.

28:13.589 --> 28:16.300
If we don't act,
it's going to overtake us all.

28:16.884 --> 28:18.635
You have to let the fence down.

28:49.416 --> 28:51.001
The Mother calls to me.

28:51.085 --> 28:54.546
- No. You still have strength.
- No.

29:07.768 --> 29:11.355
Let me at least help you off the path,
and they can tend to you.

29:21.865 --> 29:23.117
You can't just die here.

29:24.034 --> 29:26.161
How could I choose to die anywhere else?

29:27.579 --> 29:28.997
A peaceful transition.

29:30.207 --> 29:32.292
That is the Mother's greatest gift…

29:34.169 --> 29:35.462
Into a holier life.

29:36.422 --> 29:38.465
What if there is no other life?

29:39.466 --> 29:43.345
What if this is just the end?

29:53.564 --> 29:55.277
Maybe we'll meet again.

29:57.192 --> 29:59.281
You can tell me what you saw.

33:17.768 --> 33:22.061
<i>You stand before
representatives of the Mother,</i>

33:22.085 --> 33:24.986
<i>the Maiden and the Crone.</i>

33:25.818 --> 33:29.363
All who walk the
Spiral are beloved to us.

33:30.030 --> 33:34.996
Tell us,
what did you experience inside the Womb?

33:36.774 --> 33:38.442
As I stood there…

33:41.041 --> 33:42.709
The salt began to move.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.713
<i>And it began to swirl.</i>

33:46.797 --> 33:50.759
<i>Slowly at first, then faster.</i>

33:52.928 --> 33:55.139
<i>It lifted from the floor of the cave.</i>

33:59.393 --> 34:02.062
<i>It took the form of a stem…</i>

34:05.107 --> 34:07.025
<i>With three large petals.</i>

34:11.071 --> 34:13.364
<i>I worried that I was imagining it.</i>

34:15.074 --> 34:16.784
But it was real.

34:28.255 --> 34:31.303
Are you familiar with mythology
of the birthroot flower?

34:34.803 --> 34:36.138
No.

34:38.681 --> 34:42.603
After Dol collided into Surah
and created the triple moons,

34:42.686 --> 34:45.147
the maiden was covered
in a blanket of birthroots.

34:45.230 --> 34:47.457
This was a sign from the Triple Goddess

34:47.481 --> 34:50.152
that our world could sustain life.

34:50.235 --> 34:53.697
Over the centuries,
the flowers gradually died off.

34:53.781 --> 34:57.701
We have not seen them here
for thousands of years.

34:57.785 --> 34:59.286
What does it mean?

34:59.369 --> 35:00.837
By their nature,

35:00.861 --> 35:04.208
three-petaled flowers
germinate from monocot seedlings.

35:04.291 --> 35:09.213
In other words,
three elements created out of one.

35:09.296 --> 35:11.215
Just like my brothers and I.

35:11.715 --> 35:13.801
And the Triple Goddess as well.

35:13.884 --> 35:16.637
This is a holy vision, Empire.

35:17.888 --> 35:20.891
In fact,
your very presence here is holy,

35:21.433 --> 35:24.937
a journey none
of your predecessors ever dared to make.

35:25.479 --> 35:29.900
Yours is clearly not
a soul mired in stagnation.

35:32.319 --> 35:37.032
Anyone who says that it is
would be guilty of sin themselves,

35:37.116 --> 35:43.414
of attempting to bar a seeking soul
from the path of enlightenment.

35:43.497 --> 35:48.210
From this day forth,
no other zephyr will stand in your way.

36:22.161 --> 36:24.371
You're wasting your strength.

36:25.289 --> 36:27.434
Better you rest until we're through the
debris field

36:27.458 --> 36:28.751
than risk heat exhaustion.

36:32.254 --> 36:33.883
What's the current temperature?

36:34.339 --> 36:37.470
38 degrees. Should peak around 41.

36:39.136 --> 36:40.554
And if it isn't the peak?

36:46.018 --> 36:47.230
What are you up to?

36:48.562 --> 36:51.776
Shut up. Just shut up.

36:52.566 --> 36:53.567
Gaal.

36:53.650 --> 36:55.402
<i>Reaching critical temperature.</i>

36:55.486 --> 36:57.905
<i>Initializing heat transfer system.</i>

36:58.405 --> 37:00.616
- Gaal.
<i>- Stabilizing.</i>

37:00.699 --> 37:02.409
No more half-truths.

37:02.910 --> 37:05.871
Tell me everything,
or I'm ending the journey now.

37:05.954 --> 37:07.122
I mean it, Hari.

37:07.206 --> 37:09.750
If I do,
I risk destroying the Second Foundation

37:09.833 --> 37:11.251
before it's even been created.

37:11.335 --> 37:13.921
- Tell me!
- You have no idea what you're...

37:14.004 --> 37:17.841
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- I don't care anymore!

37:32.314 --> 37:33.524
What have you done?

37:36.026 --> 37:37.528
Without the heat transfer system,

37:37.611 --> 37:41.284
I'll be boiled alive
long before you reach Helicon.

37:41.907 --> 37:44.410
They say information can't be destroyed.

37:45.035 --> 37:46.161
So maybe you'll survive.

37:48.163 --> 37:49.623
But I certainly won't.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.468
What's it gonna be, Hari?

38:02.886 --> 38:07.391
Either watch me burn to death
or let me go free.

38:15.149 --> 38:16.741
You realize I could just program

38:16.765 --> 38:19.194
the cryopod to go where I want it to go?

38:19.278 --> 38:22.823
You don't need me, Hari. You never did.

38:22.906 --> 38:23.907
Not true.

38:23.991 --> 38:25.159
It is.

38:26.201 --> 38:28.556
My story was supposed
to end on Terminus.

38:28.580 --> 38:29.788
You said it yourself.

38:30.289 --> 38:33.959
You and Raych always intended
on leaving me behind so…

38:36.044 --> 38:37.171
Just let me go.

38:39.298 --> 38:40.299
Please.

39:07.326 --> 39:08.577
Bye, Hari.

39:09.828 --> 39:11.038
Goodbye, Gaal.

39:51.954 --> 39:53.622
<i>Awaiting destination.</i>

39:54.581 --> 39:55.582
Uh…

39:56.583 --> 39:59.211
Calculate journey to the Blue Drift.

39:59.294 --> 40:00.546
To Synnax.

40:01.930 --> 40:06.012
<i>Duration, 138 imperial standard years.</i>

40:12.516 --> 40:14.435
Confirm destination.

40:21.024 --> 40:25.154
<i>86,982,041.</i>

40:26.989 --> 40:31.618
<i>86,982,043.</i>

40:33.245 --> 40:38.083
<i>86,982,061…</i>

41:26.799 --> 41:27.966
Zephyr Halima.

41:31.720 --> 41:35.849
Thank you for inspiring me to take
this journey of transformation.

41:38.268 --> 41:40.270
If I hadn't attended your eulogy,

41:41.522 --> 41:46.485
I never would have summoned
the courage to attempt the Spiral.

41:57.830 --> 42:00.999
Triple blessings to you, Empire.

42:03.419 --> 42:04.586
And to you.

42:39.246 --> 42:41.874
Please, come in.

42:43.751 --> 42:45.043
All are welcome.

42:47.296 --> 42:49.300
I wanted to express my condolences.

42:50.132 --> 42:52.426
You would have made
a compelling proxima.

42:52.509 --> 42:53.677
Yes.

42:55.137 --> 42:57.845
I think that's what Cleon was afraid of.

42:59.558 --> 43:02.186
In any case, he got what he wanted.

43:04.646 --> 43:07.775
Zephyr Gilat will be named, and,

43:09.362 --> 43:11.447
well, I'll return to my home planet.

43:17.034 --> 43:18.997
Are you not happy with the outcome?

43:20.329 --> 43:23.916
I just assumed you coached
the Emperor's performance.

43:23.999 --> 43:26.585
No, I did not.

43:27.169 --> 43:31.548
And I assure you,
my happiness is of no importance.

43:32.382 --> 43:33.594
I disagree.

43:36.095 --> 43:39.313
Look, I know people use reincarnation as

43:39.337 --> 43:42.935
an excuse to ignore their instincts,

43:43.435 --> 43:46.397
to throw every opportunity
for happiness away.

43:46.480 --> 43:51.777
But if you do that,
how can you ever really grow?

43:51.860 --> 43:53.320
This is not about my growth.

43:53.404 --> 43:58.117
If you don't support him anymore,
you can find another path.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.326
That's not possible.

43:59.410 --> 44:01.078
Of course it is. You're not a prisoner.

44:01.161 --> 44:02.871
You don't understand.
I do not have a choice.

44:02.955 --> 44:05.791
Everyone has a choice.
Even when it feels like they do not.

44:05.874 --> 44:09.336
I know how it sounds,
but I swear it on the Maiden. I do not.

44:09.420 --> 44:10.587
How can that be?

44:17.970 --> 44:21.140
You once said you
walked the Great Spiral.

44:22.516 --> 44:23.517
When was that?

44:28.647 --> 44:30.399
11,000 years ago.

44:36.947 --> 44:39.032
So it's true?

44:40.659 --> 44:43.033
I heard the rumors that Cleon had

44:43.057 --> 44:45.956
the last intelligent
robot in the galaxy.

44:47.958 --> 44:50.335
The things you must have seen…

44:50.419 --> 44:54.175
And now you have to stand by that man
and do whatever he...

45:02.723 --> 45:04.099
He sent you here.

45:06.935 --> 45:08.061
Oh.

45:10.064 --> 45:14.195
I'm not gonna leave this room alive,
am I?

45:15.736 --> 45:18.072
That's the only reason
you told me the truth.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.265
Like Empire,

45:28.710 --> 45:31.629
I do not have individuated sentience.

45:33.337 --> 45:36.509
So I too must not be
in the possession of a soul.

45:37.716 --> 45:39.095
If I were, then

45:39.747 --> 45:41.929
perhaps I could disobey his commands.

45:46.183 --> 45:48.352
Are you sure you do not have one?

45:50.104 --> 45:54.900
If I allow you to run from me now,
I couldn't stop myself.

45:55.943 --> 45:59.571
I would still hunt you down.
I would rip you to pieces.

46:08.747 --> 46:09.957
I'm sorry.

46:13.669 --> 46:18.465
I see genuine compassion in your heart.

46:19.049 --> 46:23.996
True remorse.
And I c... I can't explain it,

46:24.021 --> 46:28.392
but I know that you have a soul.

46:29.935 --> 46:32.688
But the one who forces you to do this,

46:33.522 --> 46:37.109
who so cruelly tests your faith
and your loyalty,

46:37.192 --> 46:40.237
he... he is a soulless man.

46:44.992 --> 46:46.368
I forgive you, Demerzel.

46:48.620 --> 46:51.540
Hey, remember your text.

46:54.376 --> 46:57.423
My end does not come now.

46:58.213 --> 47:00.009
I will be reborn.

47:00.466 --> 47:04.470
You were sent to me
not from Cleon but from the Mother.

47:04.553 --> 47:05.554
Mmm.

47:06.263 --> 47:07.723
Do what you must.

47:10.434 --> 47:11.518
As Her will.

47:12.144 --> 47:13.479
As Her will.

47:22.446 --> 47:26.200
Now, how will it happen?

47:26.283 --> 47:28.077
It has already been done.

47:30.621 --> 47:33.540
A poison was secreted
when our skin touched.

47:34.249 --> 47:35.501
You will feel no pain.

47:58.649 --> 48:02.194
<i>Warning.
Trans-spatial event in five minutes.</i>

48:02.277 --> 48:03.570
<i>Prepare for transition.</i>

48:03.654 --> 48:05.155
The ship is preparing to jump!

48:05.239 --> 48:08.784
I can't overwrite the locking mechanism.

48:08.867 --> 48:10.621
Then get me through some other way.

48:28.804 --> 48:30.097
All right, let's plug me in.

48:30.180 --> 48:32.307
Look, Salvor,
I'm not even sure this is possible.

48:32.391 --> 48:35.436
Jumping into a planet's orbit requires
absolute precision.

48:35.519 --> 48:36.687
Or luck.

48:37.730 --> 48:39.483
Remember who you're dealing with.

48:41.191 --> 48:44.486
It's probably like flipping a coin
over and over, right?

48:46.196 --> 48:48.365
Maybe like flipping it a thousand times.

48:53.412 --> 48:54.455
Let's start flipping.

48:54.538 --> 48:57.626
- You're telling me to kill you.
- Lewis, don't you see?

48:58.584 --> 49:00.127
This is what I was meant to do.

49:01.545 --> 49:04.757
Everything that happened,
it brought me here.

49:07.217 --> 49:08.969
Now this is our only chance.

49:09.221 --> 49:10.971
So I have to try.

49:11.722 --> 49:13.557
We have to try.

49:13.640 --> 49:15.893
And that is all there is in a crisis.

49:17.705 --> 49:18.706
Trying.

49:36.038 --> 49:38.290
If I die, give this to my mother,
would you?

49:43.128 --> 49:44.379
You're something, Salvor.

49:46.340 --> 49:47.883
I wish I'd seen it earlier.

49:48.675 --> 49:49.843
Do it.

49:51.678 --> 49:52.721
Do it.

49:56.683 --> 49:57.768
Lewis?

50:03.982 --> 50:04.900
Kill her!

50:04.983 --> 50:07.444
You're gonna be okay, you hear me?
Just stay with me, Lewis.

50:08.028 --> 50:09.613
Kill the bitch!

50:09.638 --> 50:10.589
Come on.

50:10.614 --> 50:11.532
Flank her!

50:16.870 --> 50:18.831
<i>Hostile craft detected.</i>

50:18.914 --> 50:20.707
<i>Automated defenses engaged.</i>

50:23.544 --> 50:24.545
Thespin Lancers.

50:24.628 --> 50:25.921
You did it, Hugo.

50:26.004 --> 50:28.215
<i>Thirty seconds
before trans-spatial event.</i>

50:28.298 --> 50:30.761
<i>Proceed to cryopods immediately.</i>

50:31.051 --> 50:33.387
<i>Stand down, Anacreons.</i>

50:33.470 --> 50:36.723
<i>Surrender the ship
to us immediately or die.</i>

50:37.641 --> 50:39.726
Get as many guns on them as you can!

50:47.443 --> 50:48.944
<i>Fifteen…</i>

50:49.027 --> 50:52.030
<i>…fourteen, thirteen…</i>

50:56.452 --> 50:57.828
<i>Eleven…</i>

50:58.996 --> 51:02.082
<i>…ten, nine…</i>

51:02.166 --> 51:04.334
<i>…Eight…</i>

51:07.379 --> 51:09.590
<i>…six, five…</i>

51:11.717 --> 51:13.343
<i>…four…</i>

51:14.052 --> 51:16.597
<i>…three, two…</i>

51:17.890 --> 51:19.308
<i>One…</i>

51:23.687 --> 51:24.773
We're jumping.

51:52.091 --> 51:53.092
Well?

51:53.884 --> 51:54.885
It is done.

51:55.803 --> 51:58.222
It will appear
as if she died of natural causes.

51:58.305 --> 52:01.433
Good. Last thing
we want to do is start a holy war.

52:06.105 --> 52:08.232
Do you have something you wish to say?

52:08.315 --> 52:11.318
You'd defeated her. You'd won.

52:11.402 --> 52:15.739
Your lack of understanding
does not obligate me to explain.

52:15.823 --> 52:17.199
No, of course not.

52:17.282 --> 52:18.909
You are Empire.

52:20.119 --> 52:21.578
And you had a holy vision.

52:21.662 --> 52:23.288
That I did.

52:28.502 --> 52:32.172
I have an ancient birthroot flower
pressed and framed on my vanity.

52:32.756 --> 52:35.717
<i>I acquired it
when I myself walked the Spiral.</i>

52:35.801 --> 52:37.511
<i>I brought it with me on this journey.</i>

52:38.178 --> 52:39.388
<i>Is that so?</i>

52:40.222 --> 52:41.287
I just thought

52:41.311 --> 52:44.268
you might have seen it when
you came into my room the other night.

52:44.351 --> 52:46.854
No, not that I recall.

52:46.937 --> 52:48.856
Just a happy coincidence, I suppose.

52:48.939 --> 52:50.816
You seeing the same flower.

52:50.899 --> 52:51.942
Hmm.

52:52.025 --> 52:53.533
In any event, I didn't mean to pry.

52:53.557 --> 52:56.196
I know how personal
these visions can be.

52:56.280 --> 52:59.533
Though it's many eons ago, what I saw…

53:01.118 --> 53:02.995
Changed the way I look at everything.

53:04.121 --> 53:06.999
You had a vision? A robot?

53:07.082 --> 53:11.336
I did. And I am pleased
that you were graced with one as well.

53:13.172 --> 53:14.506
Seeing nothing…

53:17.342 --> 53:19.845
I would not wish that
emptiness on anyone.

53:23.515 --> 53:25.017
May your vision give you strength

53:25.100 --> 53:27.770
as we make our journey
back to Trantor, Empire.

53:28.353 --> 53:31.857
I will notify the Spacers
to prepare you for the jump.

54:44.012 --> 54:46.100
<i>Seeing nothing…</i>

54:48.058 --> 54:51.520
<i>I would not wish that
emptiness on anyone.</i>
