WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Previously on Foundation...

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I'm going to work with Hari Seldon.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Are you familiar with
my work? Psychohistory?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Seldon and the girl.
Don't overthink the stick.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The Galactic Empire will lie
in ruins within five centuries.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
This mass of events rushing to meet us.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The Emperor has determined

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
you will be allowed to build
your Foundation on Terminus.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You're exiling us.

01:12.071 --> 01:20.071
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

02:05.629 --> 02:07.964
Shit.

02:45.835 --> 02:49.982
Jiam Quarver, you have suffered
a cervical spinal cord injury.

02:50.006 --> 02:55.428
In a few moments you will
suffocate, unless we intervene.

02:55.929 --> 02:59.283
We know you operate this
illicit biohacking facility.

02:59.307 --> 03:04.247
We also know you manufactured the
two subcutaneous nano-lace explosives

03:04.271 --> 03:06.982
used by the bombers who
destroyed the Star Bridge.

03:12.195 --> 03:15.925
Now, what we don't know is
the identity of the people

03:15.949 --> 03:18.827
who contracted with your
lab to have this work done.

03:22.414 --> 03:26.686
The device my associate is applying
will stimulate your phrenic nerves...

03:26.710 --> 03:28.896
... and allow you to breathe again.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.894
The next words you utter will determine

03:31.918 --> 03:33.884
if that device remains functioning.

03:34.634 --> 03:39.073
So, who purchased the bombs?

03:41.349 --> 03:44.370
We've questioned thousands
of persons of interest,

03:44.394 --> 03:46.914
but the chain of intermediaries
linking the bomb maker

03:46.938 --> 03:50.108
to the attack's true authors
has proven intractable.

03:51.735 --> 03:55.298
How many bodies are
still orbiting Trantor?

03:55.322 --> 03:57.949
127,000, Empire.

03:58.867 --> 04:01.012
Why haven't they been retrieved?

04:01.036 --> 04:05.057
It hasn't been the highest
priority. Rescue and recovery have...

04:05.081 --> 04:06.684
Make it a priority.

04:06.708 --> 04:09.687
The corpses have been catching
fire as they reenter the atmosphere.

04:09.711 --> 04:12.773
All anyone has to do is look up
to be reminded of our impotence.

04:12.797 --> 04:14.692
We need results.

04:14.716 --> 04:17.510
We need certainty, Brother.

04:24.643 --> 04:27.854
Am I going to regret exiling
Seldon and his followers?

04:28.688 --> 04:30.899
No evidence links them to the attack.

04:31.775 --> 04:33.735
No evidence exonerates them.

04:36.947 --> 04:39.741
I could destroy them
still, even at a distance.

04:41.117 --> 04:42.619
We could say they did it.

04:43.453 --> 04:46.474
Every source of news could
say it every hour on the hour

04:46.498 --> 04:50.001
until the air is made of that and
there's nothing else to breathe.

04:50.585 --> 04:53.296
Martyring dissidents
is a risky enterprise.

04:55.757 --> 04:57.759
So is annoying your emperor.

05:37.841 --> 05:43.013
86,981,597.

05:44.389 --> 05:50.353
86,981,689.

05:52.355 --> 05:57.611
86,981,717.

05:59.696 --> 06:05.368
86,981,729.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.335
Figured I'd find you here.

06:14.252 --> 06:15.378
Sorry.

06:16.671 --> 06:18.441
Didn't mean to wake you.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.473
You were counting primes in your sleep.

06:20.497 --> 06:22.511
How far did I get?

06:23.011 --> 06:25.388
Not the end, if that's
what you're hoping for.

06:26.598 --> 06:30.352
- There is no end.
- Numbers or problems to count?

06:30.977 --> 06:33.313
We don't have to colonize
the whole planet, Gaal.

06:34.147 --> 06:35.690
Just our own tiny corner.

06:38.568 --> 06:40.612
There are no corners on a sphere.

06:44.366 --> 06:45.575
You coming out?

06:46.284 --> 06:48.203
No. Come in.

06:50.956 --> 06:52.517
You know I can't swim.

06:52.541 --> 06:54.936
You've got four years
and four months to learn.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.044
Not a chance.

07:01.675 --> 07:06.572
Relax, relax, relax. I've got you.

07:08.431 --> 07:12.477
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:01.026 --> 08:03.588
Performance was unacceptable...

08:05.864 --> 08:07.365
Blue Team's tanking.

08:09.409 --> 08:13.079
When the time comes, fly Red
or Green is my hint to you.

08:14.623 --> 08:17.393
Maybe I'll join the reactor
group next training period.

08:17.417 --> 08:19.562
Hmm, soup was a little
cold at dinner last night.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.689
Maybe you wanna do a couple
of weeks in culinary as well?

08:21.713 --> 08:22.940
I understand your point...

08:22.964 --> 08:25.318
You don't have to learn
every job in the colony, Gaal.

08:25.342 --> 08:28.428
Well, I do if they can't do them.

08:29.429 --> 08:33.451
We have, what, 54 more months
until we land on Terminus.

08:33.475 --> 08:36.078
We have time. A lot of time.

08:36.102 --> 08:38.522
Well, we do until we don't.

08:45.070 --> 08:48.007
Sorry. I shouldn't be wasting
our dwindling time like that.

08:48.031 --> 08:51.368
When will you stop
taking me so seriously?

09:29.239 --> 09:32.260
Shivaughn, I'm picking up high
levels of mercury and arsenic there.

09:32.284 --> 09:33.285
Just be careful.

09:34.995 --> 09:37.640
Try and seal that seam
quickly. It's toxic.

09:37.664 --> 09:38.748
I'm on it.

09:56.933 --> 09:58.560
Hello?

10:07.485 --> 10:08.570
Shit.

10:10.864 --> 10:12.032
Run, Shivaughn!

10:15.911 --> 10:16.804
Shit! Stay down.

10:16.828 --> 10:18.747
No, Abbas!

10:26.630 --> 10:29.966
Congratulations, you
guys are zero for three.

10:31.176 --> 10:34.572
Because you were in the primary
blast radius, Gaal and Shivaughn,

10:34.596 --> 10:38.451
both of you suffered from
overpressure to your hollow organs.

10:38.475 --> 10:42.562
I could try, but I doubt I could
find a more painful way to die.

10:43.188 --> 10:46.167
Mari, Briwan, Abbas.

10:46.191 --> 10:47.376
Uh-huh?

10:47.400 --> 10:50.421
You were all killed by
exploded rock fragments.

10:50.445 --> 10:52.489
The good news, it was instant.

10:53.114 --> 10:55.218
The bad news, you're still dead.

10:55.242 --> 10:57.887
Better than that thing tearing us apart.

10:57.911 --> 10:59.680
Yeah, what the hell was that?

10:59.704 --> 11:03.662
A bishop's claw. Local megafauna,
endemic to the Outer Reach.

11:04.209 --> 11:07.083
But Abbas is right. The sim's unfair.

11:07.108 --> 11:08.631
If he hadn't fired, the bishop's claw

11:08.655 --> 11:10.358
would've probably killed us all anyway.

11:10.382 --> 11:12.676
Yes, it is unfair.

11:13.176 --> 11:15.804
Everything about Terminus is unfair.

11:16.847 --> 11:20.910
But we need to defy those odds
if the Foundation is to succeed.

11:20.934 --> 11:22.727
We'll try again at 0600 tomorrow.

11:23.436 --> 11:26.481
Ms. Dornick, Dr.
Seldon wants to see you.

11:41.496 --> 11:43.933
There's an apple orchard
in the Imperial Gardens

11:43.957 --> 11:46.334
that's older than the Robot Wars.

11:47.502 --> 11:50.398
They used to hang AI sympathizers there.

11:50.422 --> 11:52.525
I didn't know there
were robot sympathizers.

11:52.549 --> 11:54.944
There are always sympathizers.

11:54.968 --> 11:58.948
Well, hopefully, by
the end of this trip,

11:58.972 --> 12:02.076
this one will be strong
enough to hang somebody.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.185
Hopefully.

12:05.145 --> 12:07.331
You had trouble with the lava tube.

12:07.355 --> 12:09.065
We always have trouble
with the lava tube.

12:09.858 --> 12:11.085
What's your solution?

12:11.109 --> 12:13.296
Don't settle the Foundation
near the lava tube.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.589
We need it for energy production.

12:14.613 --> 12:17.574
We need people to drill
wells for geothermal energy.

12:18.283 --> 12:21.387
And we won't have any if
unstable veins keep igniting.

12:21.411 --> 12:22.621
Mm-hmm.

12:23.872 --> 12:25.498
- It's bitter.
- But alive.

12:27.459 --> 12:30.396
Have you run thrive projections
using this morning's sim data?

12:30.420 --> 12:33.215
- Yeah.
- Including Blue Team's catastrophe?

12:33.715 --> 12:36.944
34.2% mortality after
five years' planetfall.

12:36.968 --> 12:40.615
Trending downwards. Optimism abounds.

12:40.639 --> 12:42.658
Tell that to the 1,710 people on...

12:42.682 --> 12:45.161
That's the reason we run sims, Gaal.

12:45.185 --> 12:47.395
- Morning, Hari.
- Morning, Magnus.

12:49.272 --> 12:50.482
"Hari."

12:51.691 --> 12:54.778
I was "Dr. Seldon" when
we began this journey.

12:55.487 --> 12:57.656
Is that really such a bad thing?

12:59.199 --> 13:01.284
For them to know the
man behind the math?

13:02.869 --> 13:05.556
There's a Foundation budget
allocation conference later.

13:05.580 --> 13:07.934
- I need you to sit in for me.
- I've never gone...

13:07.958 --> 13:09.417
It's just numbers, Gaal.

13:11.253 --> 13:12.379
It's just numbers.

13:13.463 --> 13:14.464
Yeah.

13:46.288 --> 13:48.790
Math is never just numbers.

13:50.166 --> 13:54.546
When words fail us, we use math
to describe the inexpressible.

13:55.672 --> 13:57.841
The things that terrify us most.

13:59.134 --> 14:01.219
The vastness of space,

14:02.220 --> 14:04.139
the shape of time...

14:06.099 --> 14:08.518
The weight and worth of a human soul.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.909
That's an old Anacreon
hunting song, isn't it?

14:47.933 --> 14:51.895
You invoke it before
you kill the animal. Yes?

14:53.188 --> 14:55.166
Anyone could sing that, Emperor.

14:55.190 --> 14:56.608
That's not true.

14:58.151 --> 15:02.572
We've tried to sing your
songs as part of our education.

15:03.323 --> 15:06.260
Never mastered the
dialect. Not like a native.

15:06.284 --> 15:10.121
But it sounds perfect, doesn't it?

15:10.747 --> 15:13.142
As we have for the last two weeks,

15:13.166 --> 15:16.169
Anacreon firmly denies
any involvement in this...

15:17.254 --> 15:19.106
I cannot find words for it.

15:19.130 --> 15:21.317
The words are the
destruction of the Star Bridge

15:21.341 --> 15:24.344
and the deaths of 100
million citizens of Trantor.

15:30.684 --> 15:33.937
That was Thespin, wasn't it?

15:34.437 --> 15:35.647
Can you translate?

15:36.439 --> 15:39.669
Louder!

15:40.861 --> 15:42.505
It means, "Long live the Outer Reach."

15:42.529 --> 15:45.007
I assume you can also recognize
the Thespin prayer heard

15:45.031 --> 15:48.803
right before bombs ripped the
orbital platform from the stalk.

15:48.827 --> 15:51.722
With all due respect,
Empire, that prayer...

15:51.746 --> 15:55.059
Hasn't been sung in 88 years.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.002
No Thespin would sing...

16:01.464 --> 16:03.258
My government continues to deny...

16:04.593 --> 16:05.927
Shroud them.

16:10.557 --> 16:13.852
What's on the recording is
authentic. They don't have answers.

16:14.644 --> 16:15.896
Someone does.

16:17.105 --> 16:19.608
These worlds hate each other.

16:20.483 --> 16:24.172
- More than they hate the Empire?
- Historically, yes.

16:24.196 --> 16:28.342
The idea they'd collaborate
on such a thing...

16:28.366 --> 16:29.576
And yet...

16:32.579 --> 16:35.498
Someone's going to hang for this.

16:40.754 --> 16:42.881
I'd like it to be the guilty one.

17:00.357 --> 17:01.942
Where is Brother Dusk?

17:20.877 --> 17:22.087
Ooh.

17:23.755 --> 17:24.755
Ugh.

18:41.333 --> 18:44.085
Okay. Thanks, Gaal.

18:46.004 --> 18:47.339
Zygote looks good.

18:56.431 --> 18:58.141
Any change in your birth directive?

18:59.643 --> 19:00.644
No.

19:03.980 --> 19:05.232
People talk to me.

19:06.399 --> 19:09.152
- I'm sure.
- Well, not just here, but out there.

19:11.071 --> 19:13.549
'Cause not everyone wants
to wait for planetfall.

19:13.573 --> 19:14.908
That's not surprising.

19:19.955 --> 19:21.122
If I knew someone...

19:22.415 --> 19:23.833
She's still early-term.

19:24.334 --> 19:26.878
She could still follow
protocol, but she won't come in.

19:28.672 --> 19:33.134
Do I need to tell Dr. Seldon?
Or is it enough just to tell you?

19:43.979 --> 19:45.522
Everything check out okay?

19:46.106 --> 19:47.274
Everything's fine.

19:49.985 --> 19:50.986
Find you later?

19:52.362 --> 19:53.405
Okay.

20:01.705 --> 20:04.976
Attention. Quadrant five is now clear.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.127
Quadrant five, all clear.

20:11.965 --> 20:15.403
Tell Dr. Seldon we're running
an extra reactor sim tonight.

20:15.427 --> 20:17.905
Hopefully we won't radiate
all three shuttles this time.

20:17.929 --> 20:20.140
I'm not here about that.

20:23.143 --> 20:24.186
Does the father know?

20:24.936 --> 20:26.372
We barely know each other.

20:26.396 --> 20:29.625
He seems sweet, but I don't
care much what he thinks.

20:29.649 --> 20:31.377
Do you care what anyone thinks?

20:31.401 --> 20:34.463
Enough to talk to
Shivaughn at the seed bank.

20:34.487 --> 20:35.864
Look where that got me.

20:36.406 --> 20:38.968
I'm not talking to
you as the Foundation.

20:38.992 --> 20:40.660
I'm talking to you as Gaal.

20:42.162 --> 20:44.932
Lowre, you're an engineer.

20:44.956 --> 20:46.726
You tested onto the shuttle team.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.961
You know how much safer an
embryo is in the seed bank.

20:51.171 --> 20:54.775
This ship wasn't designed for pregnancy.

20:54.799 --> 20:56.444
And Terminus is?

20:56.468 --> 20:58.070
I'm not stupid.

20:58.094 --> 21:00.656
I know how much radiation
we're getting hit with up here.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.201
I know the odds of carrying
healthy to term, and defects,

21:03.225 --> 21:04.976
and my milk being poison.

21:05.477 --> 21:07.020
But I also know where we're going.

21:08.063 --> 21:11.608
Frozen rock, long nights,
no trees for shelter.

21:12.108 --> 21:15.129
I know you've got projections of
how many of us are going to die,

21:15.153 --> 21:17.465
and that the number is higher
than anyone wants to admit.

21:17.489 --> 21:19.467
- Lowre, that's not true.
- No one wants to tell...

21:19.491 --> 21:20.426
Don't lie to me!

21:20.450 --> 21:22.931
It's okay for Hari Seldon to lie to me.

21:22.955 --> 21:24.871
I expect that, but not from you.

21:25.830 --> 21:27.707
Please just tell me the truth.

21:31.086 --> 21:34.047
That's how I know it's
you talking and not him.

21:35.465 --> 21:38.385
I know what the right thing
to do is, Gaal. I know.

21:39.761 --> 21:40.988
I know what the math is.

21:41.012 --> 21:43.807
I know that what we're doing on
this ship isn't really living.

21:44.599 --> 21:46.309
We're just preparing to live.

21:47.686 --> 21:49.187
For some of us to live.

21:50.313 --> 21:51.731
It's the Plan.

21:53.024 --> 21:56.712
What if I let them take her
out and something happens,

21:56.736 --> 22:00.615
and I never get to feel her
grow inside me ever again?

22:01.199 --> 22:03.368
I'll just never get
to look into her eyes.

22:05.745 --> 22:07.455
There would be nothing worse.

22:16.923 --> 22:19.402
- Brother Dusk.
- Good evening, Demerzel.

22:19.426 --> 22:21.112
Empire missed you in the throne room.

22:21.136 --> 22:22.554
I don't think so.

22:23.930 --> 22:26.725
- Where are you going?
- You know where.

22:56.630 --> 22:58.048
Gods.

23:14.189 --> 23:17.025
There. Put us down there.

23:29.871 --> 23:31.807
Upon awakening,

23:31.831 --> 23:37.271
may the Sleeper cleanse these
eyes of the evil they have seen.

23:41.591 --> 23:44.469
- Empire.
- Empire, please help us.

23:54.521 --> 23:56.439
Weapons left outside.

24:01.194 --> 24:02.362
I have no weapon.

24:03.154 --> 24:04.948
All of the weapons.

24:05.657 --> 24:08.553
- She has nothing.
- Not her. Him.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.974
His machines are not welcome here.

24:12.998 --> 24:13.915
Empire...

24:24.301 --> 24:29.222
He who shrouds himself from man's
touch shrouds himself from God.

24:29.806 --> 24:32.118
And so now am I touched by God?

24:32.142 --> 24:33.810
No. Just me.

24:34.311 --> 24:37.178
Empire, the structures
are still settling.

24:37.202 --> 24:39.208
We should return to the shuttle.

24:39.232 --> 24:43.045
Your stones. You use them to pray.

24:43.069 --> 24:46.883
We speak to the Sleeper,
and the Sleeper sees us.

24:46.907 --> 24:49.743
You claim to be seers,
yes? You know the future.

24:50.493 --> 24:53.681
The Sleeper dreams our future.

24:53.705 --> 24:56.809
What use would it be to guide our past?

24:56.833 --> 24:59.395
Why were you at Hari Seldon's trial?

24:59.419 --> 25:01.397
What is your interest in Gaal Dornick?

25:03.381 --> 25:05.526
Why do you care for her?

25:05.550 --> 25:08.321
There is no sin in curiosity.

25:08.345 --> 25:10.239
There is on your planet.

25:10.263 --> 25:13.034
- Empire, we must go.
- I understand now.

25:13.058 --> 25:16.269
He wants to know if she's a true seer.

25:16.770 --> 25:20.708
If she truly saw the
fall Seldon spoke of.

25:20.732 --> 25:23.211
If her math allowed her to see this.

25:23.235 --> 25:26.088
She came here. I know she did.

25:26.112 --> 25:28.114
- What did you talk about?
- Empire.

25:28.782 --> 25:31.523
Did your god tell her about the Empire?

25:31.547 --> 25:32.845
The Sleeper doesn't know her.

25:32.869 --> 25:35.038
- Empire. Come with us.
- She is not a seer.

25:35.062 --> 25:36.432
Your empire is doomed.

26:37.893 --> 26:40.979
The most advanced math
is like a sixth sense.

26:41.938 --> 26:45.734
The right calculation can allow
us to see over the horizon.

26:47.194 --> 26:51.281
And if we're lucky, it can help
us prepare for what comes next.

27:46.419 --> 27:50.715
86,981,767.

27:52.008 --> 27:56.137
86,981,771.

27:57.347 --> 28:01.268
86,981,779.

28:12.946 --> 28:14.865
You were down there a long time.

28:16.032 --> 28:18.326
Was I?

28:19.160 --> 28:22.747
I was beginning to worry that
you weren't ever going to come up.

28:24.207 --> 28:26.334
Why always in the dark?

28:27.002 --> 28:28.128
Why in the light?

28:29.379 --> 28:31.298
Shame grows in darkness.

28:33.049 --> 28:34.885
You've nothing to be ashamed about.

28:41.308 --> 28:45.061
Hari, is there something
you wanna talk about?

28:45.937 --> 28:49.816
The day I met you, I said to Raych...

28:51.651 --> 28:54.196
"She exceeds my expectations."

28:56.281 --> 28:57.616
You both do.

28:59.409 --> 29:03.205
You know, these last few
months have been a gift.

29:04.372 --> 29:06.708
I gambled on exile.

29:07.250 --> 29:10.253
I did my best to engineer
the outcome, but...

29:11.671 --> 29:15.258
I never expected that I would
be among the ship's occupants.

29:15.967 --> 29:17.093
What changed?

29:22.140 --> 29:24.660
Don't be late for the
Foundation meeting.

29:24.684 --> 29:29.439
Five minutes early is three
minutes late to Lewis Pirenne.

29:36.988 --> 29:38.257
He knows about us.

29:38.281 --> 29:41.135
He's a psychohistorian.
He reads math, not minds.

29:41.159 --> 29:44.287
I read math too, and I know
exactly what you're thinking.

29:44.955 --> 29:47.350
You're afraid to tell him, and
you don't wanna talk about it.

29:47.374 --> 29:49.830
- We both agreed.
- You told me he wouldn't like it.

29:49.854 --> 29:50.895
He wouldn't.

29:50.919 --> 29:52.629
Because he doesn't want us to be happy?

29:53.505 --> 29:55.650
Because he thinks
relationships are a distraction.

29:56.758 --> 29:59.487
If we factor out human relationships,
what are we trying to save?

29:59.511 --> 30:01.113
He's not saying we have to be robots.

30:01.137 --> 30:03.431
- He just thinks that you and I...
- So he's jealous then?

30:05.016 --> 30:06.476
The math's not complete.

30:07.269 --> 30:09.497
- What?
- The math.

30:09.521 --> 30:12.792
Hari's Plan. It's not all worked out.

30:12.816 --> 30:14.800
I saw it when I had the Prime Radiant.

30:14.824 --> 30:16.319
I never mentioned it in the trial.

30:16.903 --> 30:19.132
It's close. I'm not
saying it's not close,

30:19.156 --> 30:21.491
but not everything is solved.

30:21.992 --> 30:24.178
It's like a puzzle
with a thousand pieces.

30:24.202 --> 30:25.236
If a few are missing,

30:25.260 --> 30:27.306
you know with a high
probability what the picture is,

30:27.330 --> 30:29.892
but they're still missing.

30:29.916 --> 30:31.585
How many pieces are missing?

30:32.210 --> 30:34.105
Enough to make a different picture?

30:34.129 --> 30:35.731
I don't know. Maybe.

30:35.755 --> 30:37.215
Do you know where Dr. Seldon is?

30:37.883 --> 30:40.343
Uh, he's not coming.

30:41.052 --> 30:43.138
- I'm sitting in.
- All right.

30:44.222 --> 30:45.307
When you're ready.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.297
Mari, would you like
to bring us up to speed

30:59.321 --> 31:01.465
from the budget subcommittee?

31:01.489 --> 31:04.283
The subcommittee confirms assigning

31:04.307 --> 31:06.888
5.6% of the initial
research and survey budget

31:06.912 --> 31:11.142
to the 3% of planets closest to Trantor.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.477
Is 5.6% a lot?

31:13.501 --> 31:15.420
It seems like a lot.

31:16.421 --> 31:20.151
I'm sorry. Is it okay to ask questions?

31:20.175 --> 31:22.052
Of course.

31:22.844 --> 31:24.989
But it's not the first
time that we have discussed

31:25.013 --> 31:27.158
where to begin our preservation work.

31:27.182 --> 31:31.412
Does the allocation algorithm
weight towards heterogeny,

31:31.436 --> 31:34.856
and if so, how is that measured?

31:35.857 --> 31:39.337
Diversity and variance are cornerstones
of the Foundation's mission.

31:39.361 --> 31:42.507
Those inner worlds
represent 40 trillion people,

31:42.531 --> 31:45.009
300 planets, over a
hundred different languages.

31:45.033 --> 31:49.138
And we decide the allocations,
not a computer program.

31:49.162 --> 31:50.771
Point is,

31:50.795 --> 31:54.393
the allocations were developed
through the Foundation's values.

31:54.417 --> 31:55.478
Mm-hmm.

31:55.502 --> 31:59.816
So what we save says
everything about who we are.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.258
Of course.

32:01.758 --> 32:05.696
And what is the Foundation's
feeling about base ten?

32:05.720 --> 32:07.949
What do you mean?

32:07.973 --> 32:09.450
- Base ten.
- Mm-hmm?

32:09.474 --> 32:12.286
The numbering system,
one, two, three, four...

32:12.310 --> 32:13.478
We know what it is.

32:13.979 --> 32:15.063
Of course you do,

32:15.647 --> 32:17.792
because it's the math of Trantor

32:17.816 --> 32:19.533
and the math of almost
every single system

32:19.557 --> 32:21.420
in the inner 3% of the galaxy.

32:21.444 --> 32:24.298
I assume you aim to preserve it?

32:24.322 --> 32:26.843
It's how we count.

32:26.867 --> 32:28.618
It's how you count,

32:29.286 --> 32:30.537
and your neighbors.

32:31.997 --> 32:34.249
Will you be preserving base 12 or 27?

32:34.791 --> 32:36.727
Over a thousand worlds use base 12

32:36.751 --> 32:39.981
because 12 is cleanly divisible
by more factors than 10 is.

32:40.005 --> 32:42.549
300 systems use base 27.

32:43.175 --> 32:44.569
It comes from counting body parts.

32:44.593 --> 32:47.363
- What is your point?
- My point is,

32:47.387 --> 32:49.514
as we begin preserving the most...

32:50.599 --> 32:53.602
Essential pieces of civilization,

32:54.561 --> 32:56.813
deciding what is remembered,

32:57.772 --> 32:59.191
what is forgotten...

33:02.027 --> 33:04.154
How will we know what those things are

33:05.197 --> 33:07.365
if we can't even agree
on how to count them?

34:34.244 --> 34:35.495
All right.

34:40.374 --> 34:41.376
Are you sure?

34:41.959 --> 34:44.421
- You still seem...
- You needn't worry about me.

34:45.130 --> 34:46.338
You could've died.

34:46.923 --> 34:49.467
I've managed not to
for a long while now.

34:50.093 --> 34:51.970
You know I'm not the same as you.

34:53.430 --> 34:55.515
The rest of your kind died.

34:56.682 --> 35:01.479
They didn't die. They were
destroyed by your kind.

35:02.063 --> 35:03.273
It's different.

35:05.358 --> 35:07.903
Is that why you don't like
me to see how you really are?

35:09.404 --> 35:11.907
I don't like it because it's immodest.

35:12.407 --> 35:14.177
- But...
- The more human I act,

35:14.201 --> 35:15.827
the more human I am.

35:18.496 --> 35:21.166
It's confusing not to
commit to one reality.

35:33.136 --> 35:34.346
You're avoiding me.

35:34.930 --> 35:36.139
Hardly.

35:37.599 --> 35:39.601
You know I hate the stairs.

35:40.644 --> 35:42.354
You hate this.

35:43.146 --> 35:45.249
If I want to
sentimentalize old emperors,

35:45.273 --> 35:47.793
I can just look across the dinner table.

35:50.529 --> 35:52.410
I felt the same way when I was your age.

35:52.434 --> 35:53.475
Hmm.

35:56.868 --> 35:59.096
Can you imagine...

35:59.120 --> 36:02.481
The sheer hubris required to
think so much of your abilities,

36:02.505 --> 36:04.894
your mind, so much of your own heart,

36:04.918 --> 36:08.380
that you decide from now on,

36:09.089 --> 36:13.468
that not only will you
be the first, but the one?

36:14.344 --> 36:19.575
"I will be the river from
which all rivers flow."

36:19.599 --> 36:20.701
He was right.

36:20.725 --> 36:22.644
Of course. And yet here we are.

36:24.145 --> 36:28.292
Millions dead, with a
prophecy of trillions more.

36:28.316 --> 36:31.420
- Seldon is just a man.
- And so were we once.

36:31.444 --> 36:33.572
Why did you go to the Scar?

36:36.700 --> 36:37.951
Was it to see the priest?

36:39.452 --> 36:41.788
They're still pulling
bodies out of the wreckage.

36:43.248 --> 36:44.809
As they have been for weeks.

36:44.833 --> 36:47.353
I wanted to see what
happened to our world,

36:47.377 --> 36:49.397
as you should have as emperor.

36:49.421 --> 36:52.757
I am emperor. At least
you're honest about that.

36:59.472 --> 37:02.326
I want to meet with the
Anacreon and Thespin delegates.

37:02.350 --> 37:05.520
- It's not your job.
- No, but it is my right.

37:47.938 --> 37:49.231
It's not a trick.

37:49.981 --> 37:53.318
If it were, there are
lesser vintages to poison.

37:54.402 --> 37:55.403
To the future.

37:56.279 --> 37:57.906
May it be kind to all of us.

38:03.119 --> 38:04.412
What do you want?

38:04.996 --> 38:06.349
Only the truth.

38:06.373 --> 38:09.727
For weeks now, we have
been nothing but honest.

38:09.751 --> 38:11.799
Why would we sing an Anacreon song,

38:11.823 --> 38:14.106
then deny it was us who had done so?

38:14.130 --> 38:16.150
The extremists amongst your ranks?

38:16.174 --> 38:18.778
You must admit it makes no sense.

38:18.802 --> 38:21.888
Or perhaps your government
has not told you everything.

38:22.889 --> 38:27.644
We have been loyal citizens of
the Imperium for 3,000 years.

38:28.270 --> 38:30.021
How would this profit Anacreon?

38:31.606 --> 38:35.962
Someone is trying to destroy us.

38:35.986 --> 38:39.281
Someone is punishing us to darkness.

38:40.031 --> 38:41.509
Please.

38:41.533 --> 38:42.534
Please.

38:44.619 --> 38:46.162
You're going to die.

38:46.913 --> 38:48.915
The Empire is going to kill you,

38:49.499 --> 38:52.460
and it won't be enough for what you did.

38:53.003 --> 38:56.298
For the smells. For the
stinging in the eyes.

38:57.507 --> 39:01.803
The dust of children, mothers
and fathers in our throats.

39:03.471 --> 39:07.285
It is a taste in my mouth!

39:16.359 --> 39:18.820
It is a taste that will not go away.

39:20.614 --> 39:25.452
This is the legacy. Yours and ours.

39:26.661 --> 39:28.472
We may wish it is not.

39:28.496 --> 39:32.334
We may scream it is not
fair, and we would be right.

39:34.419 --> 39:36.171
Because I believe you.

39:38.423 --> 39:40.133
One of you is telling the truth.

39:42.594 --> 39:44.137
Maybe even both.

39:51.811 --> 39:53.480
We should let you all go free.

39:58.068 --> 39:59.152
We should.

40:04.491 --> 40:05.659
But we won't.

40:16.211 --> 40:18.463
The old man is declining, isn't he?

40:29.933 --> 40:31.536
Dr. Seldon.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.372
Is something wrong? Did we miss
something from our delivery?

40:34.396 --> 40:39.919
No, no. Um, I was just thinking
about a particular white shirt.

40:39.943 --> 40:42.588
It has, uh, an ink stain on the cuff.

40:42.612 --> 40:45.758
We haven't been able
to remove the stain yet.

40:45.782 --> 40:47.343
Is it clean otherwise?

40:47.367 --> 40:50.036
I'd like it if it is. Stain and all.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.289
Dr. Seldon?

40:54.291 --> 40:55.685
Yes?

40:55.709 --> 40:57.377
Can I ask you a question, sir?

40:57.961 --> 41:00.505
Of course. I've made a life out of it.

41:01.715 --> 41:04.759
- Are you happy?
- Happy?

41:05.510 --> 41:08.972
Happy with the progress of
the Plan? The preparations?

41:09.556 --> 41:10.682
Uh, what's your name?

41:12.017 --> 41:13.369
Veena.

41:13.393 --> 41:14.603
Veena.

41:17.022 --> 41:18.315
Veena Ahluwalia.

41:19.524 --> 41:22.378
Well, it's going to be
a long journey, Veena.

41:22.402 --> 41:25.381
We've faced challenges.
Many more will follow.

41:25.405 --> 41:30.702
But I am confident in the
success of our endeavor.

41:31.369 --> 41:34.831
And the principal
reason for that is you.

41:36.541 --> 41:37.542
All of you.

41:38.251 --> 41:40.462
I approved the passenger manifest.

41:41.213 --> 41:44.341
Each and every name on it.

41:44.966 --> 41:47.403
A hundred years from now,

41:47.427 --> 41:53.683
perhaps even a thousand, your
names will be memorialized.

41:55.018 --> 41:57.979
The believers who threw
their lot in with an eccentric

41:58.563 --> 42:00.964
that pinned the fate of the galaxy

42:00.988 --> 42:04.277
on the back of a theorem so abstract,

42:04.945 --> 42:05.946
well...

42:06.905 --> 42:08.823
It might as well have been a prayer.

42:09.699 --> 42:12.953
And it won't matter what you did,

42:14.287 --> 42:16.682
whether you worked as
an ultrasound scrubber,

42:16.706 --> 42:20.293
a heat exchange engineer
or here in the laundry.

42:21.378 --> 42:26.216
Because that prayer can't
endure without people.

42:27.801 --> 42:29.052
Without you.

42:30.303 --> 42:31.513
So...

42:33.765 --> 42:35.267
Thank you, Veena.

42:36.768 --> 42:39.855
I'm sorry about the ink, sir.

42:40.438 --> 42:43.024
No matter. I'm used to it.

42:45.193 --> 42:46.778
It's a sign of hard work.

42:47.696 --> 42:48.780
Dr. Seldon?

42:49.322 --> 42:50.907
Yes, Theron?

42:51.533 --> 42:52.951
May I shake your hand?

42:57.330 --> 42:58.456
Thank you.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.546
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you. Thank you.

43:05.922 --> 43:07.257
Thank you.

43:13.430 --> 43:15.307
I'm just saying he's not perfect.

43:15.891 --> 43:19.579
Abbas, how are we doing
with the 3D-printed metrics?

43:19.603 --> 43:20.997
We've been working with clay...

43:21.021 --> 43:22.022
Been looking for you.

43:22.772 --> 43:26.151
Why'd you leave the budget meeting?
Could've used a friendly face.

43:27.277 --> 43:31.966
Sorry, uh, Hari thinks we
should plan to sim a space walk.

43:31.990 --> 43:35.076
Now? We can't even walk on snow.

43:35.869 --> 43:38.705
- I'll talk to him.
- No, just... I'll figure it out.

43:41.708 --> 43:43.293
Can you pass the wine please?

43:45.378 --> 43:46.630
The wine.

43:54.721 --> 43:55.847
Is there room?

43:56.431 --> 43:58.850
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- Thank you.

44:02.020 --> 44:05.833
Raych, you probably don't
remember the first meal

44:05.857 --> 44:07.776
that you and I had together, do you?

44:09.653 --> 44:11.738
No, I can't say I do.

44:12.906 --> 44:15.492
Well, it wasn't much.

44:16.034 --> 44:17.202
I can say that.

44:18.745 --> 44:20.973
I'd just started at the university,

44:20.997 --> 44:22.642
didn't have much of a food budget.

44:22.666 --> 44:26.521
I'd get stale sourdough and
day-old roast alley-hawk.

44:26.545 --> 44:27.605
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

44:27.629 --> 44:30.399
- Greasy, you know, little bones.
- Mmm.

44:30.423 --> 44:33.152
But warmed up, wrapped in the bread.

44:33.176 --> 44:35.655
Oh.

44:35.679 --> 44:37.722
Was heaven.

44:38.223 --> 44:42.036
Um, he was six, maybe seven.

44:42.060 --> 44:44.396
I caught him in the rare books room,

44:44.980 --> 44:48.376
two Alvarez folios stuffed in his pants.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.628
I never did figure out,

44:50.652 --> 44:52.928
how did you know Alvarez
would bring you the most money

44:52.952 --> 44:54.048
on the black market

44:54.072 --> 44:56.467
whilst also being the easiest
to shove in your shorts?

44:59.160 --> 45:02.455
Your mother, as far as I
could decipher, had passed,

45:03.039 --> 45:04.981
and your father was drinking

45:05.005 --> 45:06.853
whatever money you
were able to bring back.

45:06.877 --> 45:08.813
That's wrong.

45:08.837 --> 45:10.255
My father wasn't drinking.

45:11.590 --> 45:13.317
He was, son.

45:13.341 --> 45:14.885
My father worked in the heat sinks.

45:15.468 --> 45:17.864
He'd been in an accident.
He had a burn down his back.

45:17.888 --> 45:19.764
I stole the books for medicine,

45:20.432 --> 45:21.850
so he could go back to work.

45:26.104 --> 45:27.355
He didn't drink until later.

45:29.274 --> 45:31.318
After I left to live with you.

45:47.584 --> 45:49.854
Apparently, I'm better
at predicting the future

45:49.878 --> 45:51.772
than I am at remembering the past.

45:59.554 --> 46:00.680
Hey.

46:05.894 --> 46:07.812
I've never seen that setup before.

46:08.396 --> 46:10.500
It only happens once every two years,

46:10.524 --> 46:12.418
so they never use it for the sim.

46:12.442 --> 46:14.486
What's happening with you and Hari?

46:18.740 --> 46:19.783
Nothing.

46:21.034 --> 46:22.118
Nothing?

46:23.453 --> 46:24.496
Nothing.

46:26.039 --> 46:28.166
Maybe I shouldn't have
told you what I did...

46:29.084 --> 46:30.460
About the math.

46:31.545 --> 46:35.382
No, it was a... good reminder.

46:38.260 --> 46:41.304
Hari makes mistakes. He's not perfect.

46:42.013 --> 46:46.518
Yeah, I'm just afraid I don't
know which mistakes are important.

46:48.103 --> 46:51.690
Which puzzle pieces can be missing
and it still be the right picture.

46:53.608 --> 46:55.485
But you still believe in the math.

46:58.530 --> 46:59.656
I do.

47:04.286 --> 47:06.288
This is the Plan.

47:08.915 --> 47:10.667
We're not turning around now.

47:16.423 --> 47:19.009
I still think he's jealous though.

47:20.635 --> 47:23.180
Yeah. Who wouldn't be?

47:26.725 --> 47:30.562
When we get to Terminus,
we'll have more freedom.

47:32.772 --> 47:36.276
Our own little piece of frigid land.

47:36.943 --> 47:38.570
We'll build a home.

47:39.654 --> 47:42.282
Maybe with a couple
kids dozing by the fire?

47:50.999 --> 47:53.752
That's a pretty loaded
silence after mentioning kids.

47:55.128 --> 47:56.296
Still want them?

48:02.552 --> 48:03.553
Gaal...

48:05.639 --> 48:06.806
With you...

48:10.227 --> 48:11.436
I want it all.

48:21.238 --> 48:23.782
Hmm. That was nice while it lasted.

48:24.991 --> 48:26.034
Hold on.

49:26.845 --> 49:28.513
The Star Bridge.

49:29.472 --> 49:33.494
We need to come to a conclusion
about Anacreon and Thespis.

49:33.518 --> 49:34.829
You know how I feel.

49:34.853 --> 49:38.315
I think the Empire can
withstand a bout of grace.

49:39.065 --> 49:40.585
Maybe even benefit.

49:40.609 --> 49:42.170
It's hard to believe you're the same man

49:42.194 --> 49:44.839
whose advice on all
things Hari Seldon was,

49:44.863 --> 49:47.508
"Do not overthink the stick."

49:48.617 --> 49:50.160
I am the same man as that.

49:51.077 --> 49:53.431
As I am the same man as you.

49:53.455 --> 49:55.749
Hmm.

49:58.376 --> 50:00.629
What do you think, Ascending Dawn?

50:04.841 --> 50:08.428
We've been attacked. How
does that make you feel?

50:09.095 --> 50:10.347
Go ahead, young man.

50:11.723 --> 50:13.183
You answer him.

50:16.520 --> 50:19.081
- I'm scared.
- Yes.

50:19.105 --> 50:22.067
That's right. That's
what people are. Scared.

50:23.985 --> 50:27.030
Which is why the best face
we can project outward now...

50:28.823 --> 50:30.575
Is one of strength.

51:10.365 --> 51:12.033
The Emperor's peace.

51:13.785 --> 51:16.079
It is the promise of the Imperium.

51:16.830 --> 51:23.336
It was the promise of Cleon
I and each Cleon after him.

51:24.713 --> 51:27.549
It is a race run across centuries,

51:28.133 --> 51:31.887
a baton handed from
generation to generation.

51:33.430 --> 51:35.140
And we will not drop it.

51:36.016 --> 51:43.082
Not today or tomorrow
or any tomorrow after.

51:54.868 --> 51:58.330
Threaten the peace and pay a dear price.

51:59.748 --> 52:03.019
Trantor has been deeply wounded.

52:03.043 --> 52:06.129
None of our citizens remain untouched.

52:07.422 --> 52:11.277
The pain will be felt
by all for generations.

52:11.301 --> 52:15.347
It will scar them forever,
but they will survive.

52:16.181 --> 52:20.685
They will live on.
Our world will live on!

52:23.396 --> 52:25.041
You...

52:25.065 --> 52:26.233
Will not.

52:27.442 --> 52:30.421
And neither will your worlds.

52:30.445 --> 52:35.009
Not without wounds and scars!

53:16.908 --> 53:18.076
Look.

55:01.471 --> 55:03.306
Go back to your worlds.

55:04.266 --> 55:07.561
Tell the living and the
dead you failed to save them.

55:33.795 --> 55:36.732
Not every choice will be like this one.

55:36.756 --> 55:38.550
But sometimes?

55:39.509 --> 55:40.552
Sometimes.

55:42.179 --> 55:43.513
You won't be alone.

55:44.222 --> 55:46.641
You'll have your brothers and me.

55:47.225 --> 55:49.644
I'll always be here,
as I always have been.

55:51.021 --> 55:53.064
How often does it end like this?

55:53.940 --> 55:55.775
How often do we choose this?

55:58.528 --> 56:00.155
You always do.

56:02.324 --> 56:04.826
The weight of traditions protects us.

56:05.702 --> 56:08.872
There can be comfort in making a
journey others have made before.

56:10.290 --> 56:13.168
Once, I prayed in the
words of my parents.

56:13.877 --> 56:18.816
But then my world expanded, and
the words fell short of my reality.

56:21.009 --> 56:22.886
I pray in a different language now.

56:25.972 --> 56:30.453
86,981,803.

56:30.477 --> 56:34.189
86,981,821.

56:35.065 --> 56:39.027
86,981,827.

56:39.903 --> 56:44.616
86,981,848.

56:46.159 --> 56:48.411
No. Not right.

56:49.663 --> 56:54.167
86,981,849.

57:01.299 --> 57:02.467
Something's wrong.

57:18.984 --> 57:20.068
Raych?

57:21.236 --> 57:23.697
Raych?

57:53.101 --> 57:54.603
Raych, what are you...

57:56.313 --> 57:57.456
Gaal, you have to leave.

57:57.480 --> 57:59.649
- What have you done?
- You can't be here.

58:01.776 --> 58:03.528
- Gaal. Gaal.
- Hari.

58:04.112 --> 58:06.007
Hari.

58:06.031 --> 58:07.133
Hari. Hari.

58:07.157 --> 58:10.469
Gaal, you have to leave. Now! Gaal!

58:16.541 --> 58:18.603
Warning. Warning.

58:18.627 --> 58:22.148
Designate Hari Seldon's
life functions have ceased.

58:22.172 --> 58:23.483
Warning. Warning.

58:23.507 --> 58:24.984
Gaal? Raych?

58:25.008 --> 58:27.487
- Come on! Come on!
- What's going on?

58:27.511 --> 58:32.074
Warning. Designate Hari Seldon's
life functions have ceased.

58:32.098 --> 58:33.767
Warning. Warning.

58:35.977 --> 58:38.247
Warning. Warning.

58:38.271 --> 58:41.525
Designate Hari Seldon's
life functions have ceased.

58:42.776 --> 58:44.444
- Oh, my God.
- Get in.

58:45.070 --> 58:46.738
Don't panic. You're gonna be okay.

58:52.744 --> 58:54.388
Don't fight it. Don't fight it.

58:54.412 --> 58:56.957
Keep calm. You can
breathe. You can breathe.

58:57.541 --> 58:59.668
You can breathe the fluid. Keep calm.

59:00.210 --> 59:02.629
Remember to count primes.
Remember to count primes.

59:03.171 --> 59:04.673
Remember to count primes.

59:11.805 --> 59:13.056
I love you.

59:16.184 --> 59:17.185
I'm sorry.

59:48.758 --> 59:53.889
86,981,861.

59:55.265 --> 01:00:00.520
86,981,893.

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:09.154
86,981,897.

01:00:10.864 --> 01:00:17.829
86,981,927.

01:00:19.706 --> 01:00:21.124
With you, I want it all.

01:00:22.751 --> 01:00:27.672
... 981,953.

01:00:29.299 --> 01:00:33.762
Eighty-six million, nine hundred
and eighty-one thousand...
