00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,308
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I KILLED HIM.

174
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,079
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

175
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,478
I JUST -- I WANTED TO OFFER
MR. KLAUSNER MY READING GLASSES.

176
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,087
YEAH, UH, I PROBABLY GOT
A DIFFERENT PRESCRIPTION.

177
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,088
ALL RIGHT. I THINK
I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.

178
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,060
DO -- DO YOU HAVE DYSLEXIA,
MR. KLAUSNER?

179
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,460
HOW DID YOU --

180
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:06,892
IT WOULD HELP EXPLAIN
WHY A MAN AS SMART AS YOU

181
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,257
DIDN'T MAKE IT
PAST EIGHTH GRADE,

182
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,395
AND WHY YOU DON'T
WANT TO READ THE LETTER.

183
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,469
IT'S NOTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF.

184
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,699
IT JUST MEANS
YOU'RE NOT OUR MAN.

185
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:13,973
Probert:
JUST BECAUSE HE'S DYSLEXIC

186
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,601
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S INNOCENT.

187
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,666
PROBERT, FOR HIM, WORDS AND
LETTERS SWIM AROUND THE PAGE.

188
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:21,436
SO, SADLY, HE AVOIDS READING
AND WRITING ALTOGETHER.

189
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,705
IT'S NOT LIKE HE SUDDENLY
WOKE UP ONE MORNING

190
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,484
AND DECIDED TO START
COMMUNICATING

191
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,183
BY CONSTRUCTING
ELABORATE CODES

192
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,054
BURIED INSIDE
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR.

193
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,052
SO IT'S BACK TO THE
NEEDLE-IN-A-HAYSTACK STRATEGY.

194
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,385
ACTUALLY,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

195
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:38,091
THERE MAY BE A WAY TO GET
THE NEEDLE TO COME TO US.

196
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,295
IN HIS CODE, THE KILLER SAYS,
"YOU'LL BE PROUD OF ME."

197
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,869
HE'S LOOKING
FOR APPROVAL.

198
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,298
IF I WRITE HIM BACK,

199
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,773
TELL HIM WHAT A GREAT JOB
I THINK HE'S DOING,

200
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,271
MAYBE HE'LL TALK TO ME.

201
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,612
YOU PLAN ON MAKING FRIENDS
WITH THIS LUNATIC?

202
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,779
WE'RE PEAS IN A POD.

203
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,738
Kate:
"YOU THINK YOU HAVE GUTS,

204
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,807
BUT ALL I HEAR IS WHINING
AND SELF-PITY."

205
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,076
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO,

206
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,583
GET HIM TO SARIN-GAS
THE WHOLE CITY?

207
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,215
I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A FAN LETTER.

208
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,950
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED REQUESTING
A NEW PARTNER?

209
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,615
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET
HIS ATTEXACTLY.RIGHT?

210
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,115
IF HE'S AS SMART
AS I THINK HE IS,

211
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,386
HE'LL SEE
THE HIDDEN MESSAGE.

212
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,763
EVERY 10 WORDS,
YOU SAID?

213
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,458
Daniel: "GREAT MOVE.

214
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,626
"I WISH I HAD YOUR GUTS.

215
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:24,298
"JUST ONE QUESTION --

216
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,977
"OUT OF ALL THE LYING, CHEATING
LAWYERS, WHY THAT ONE?

217
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,309
YOUR FRIEND,
KINDRED SPIRIT."

218
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,046
"KINDRED SPIRIT."
I LIKE THAT.

219
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,922
WE SHOULD RUSH A COPY OF THIS
TO THE PAPER

220
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,190
SO THEY CAN GET IT
IN TOMORROW'S EDITION.

221
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,148
MAYBE WE COULD
BRING IT OVER THERE

222
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,517
IN A HORSE AND BUGGY.

223
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:42,985
IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY?

224
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,663
LISTEN, PAPERS
HAVE ONLINE EDITIONS.

225
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,492
I'M JUST GONNA POST THIS
AS A COMMENT

226
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,996
TO THE ORIGINAL LETTER,
OKAY?

227
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,804
MAYBE HE'S NOT CHECKING
THE COMMENTS.

228
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,496
MAYBE HE DOESN'T EVEN
OWN A COMPUTER.

229
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,207
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE'S LIKE ME.

230
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,679
SOME PEOPLE STILL LIKE THE FEEL
OF A NEWSPAPER IN THEIR HANDS.

231
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,209
WHAT ARE YOU, A LUDDITE?

232
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,353
THE LUDDITES
WERE ONTO SOMETHING.

233
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:09,354
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE
WHO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ONLINE

234
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,282
LOSE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY
SIMPLE EMOTIONS

235
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,048
EXPRESSED IN PHOTOGRAPHS
OF HUMAN FACES.

236
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,586
I MEAN, COMPUTERS MAY BE THE
GREATEST TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE

237
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:18,063
OF THE LAST 100 YEARS, BUT THIS
WHOLE INTERNET THING IS --

238
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,731
INVALUABLE IN MAKING
INSTANTANEOUS CONTACT

239
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,231
AT CRUCIAL TIMES?

240
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,232
HE ANSWERED?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

241
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,534
"HEY, KINDRED SPIRIT.

242
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,865
"GLAD TO KNOW
I'M NOT ALONE.

243
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,201
"YOU'LL GET
YOUR ANSWER TOMORROW

244
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,596
"WHEN THE NEXT [BLEEP]
GETS HIS MAIL.

245
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,468
"BUT IF YOU'RE AS SMART
AS I THINK YOU ARE,

246
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,035
YOU CAN BE THERE
WHEN IT HAPPENS."

247
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,084
WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS THAT?

248
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,980
IT'S ANOTHER CIPHER.

249
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,712
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE I'M THE
ONLY ONE THAT GETS THE MESSAGE.

250
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,618
CAN YOU DECIPHER IT?

251
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,150
Codebreaker:
THAT'S A NASTY ONE.

252
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:52,026
AND IT'S ONLY, WHAT?

253
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,759
SIX HOURS BEFORE
THE MORNING POST COMES 'ROUND.

254
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,767
NOT SURE IF WE CAN CRACK IT
IN TIME.

255
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,883
NO. NO. NO.

256
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,723
IT'S NOT A VIGENÃ¨RE SEQUENCE.

257
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,889
AND IT'S NOT A POLYALPHABETIC
SUBSTITUTION, EITHER.

258
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,548
WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS THAT?

259
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,756
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
IF IT'S NOT WHAT IT IS?

260
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,659
TRACED THE I.P. ADDRESS THE GUY
USED TO SEND THE REPLY FROM.

261
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,232
CAME UP EMPTY.

262
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,799
CODEBREAKERS AT THE NSA
COME UP WITH ANYTHING?

263
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,458
NOTHING YET.

264
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,396
WELL, THEN
HE BETTER HURRY UP,

265
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,271
BECAUSE THE CHICAGO
POSTAL WORKERS

266
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,400
ARE ABOUT TO HAVE
THEIR MORNING COFFEE!

267
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,935
YEAH, DO YOU NOT THINK I'M
EXCRUCIATINGLY AWARE OF THAT?

268
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,571
I CAN'T --
DON'T -- I CAN'T --

269
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,106
I CAN'T DO THIS WITH EVERYBODY
HOVERING AROUND ME.

270
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,482
[ SIGHS ]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

271
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:51,424
THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE BIT OF HELP.

272
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,591
YEAH,
YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.

273
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,920
WHAT FUN IS THERE
PLAYING A GAME

274
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,456
IF THE OTHER FELLOW
HASN'T GOT A SPORTING CHANCE?

275
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,662
YOU'RE TALKING IN RIDDLES.
I HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE.

276
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:06,096
I'M SIMPLY SAYING IT WOULDN'T
BE CRICKET FOR THIS FELLOW

277
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,673
TO WRITE A CODE

278
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,641
WITHOUT SENDING ALONG AT LEAST
A HINT OF HOW TO CRACK IT.

279
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,640
YOU THINK THE KILLER HID A KEY
WITHIN THE CODE ITSELF.

280
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:20,154
WELL, IF HE HAD,
HE'D LIKELY OPEN WITH IT...

281
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,220
WOULDN'T HE?

282
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:28,788
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS,
PIERCE.

283
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:33,662
LOOK VERY CLOSELY
AT THE NUMBERS.

284
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:40,867
WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE GROUPS OF FIGURES?

285
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,971
[ SIGHS ]

286
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:46,813
14, 41...

287
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,210
NO. 144. 12.

288
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,383
144 IS THE SQUARE OF 12.

289
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,382
225 IS THE SQUARE
OF 15.

290
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,054
SQUARES AND THEIR ROOTS.

291
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:00,153
WELL, THAT'S GOT
TO MEAN SOMETHING.

292
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,487
WHAT? WHAT?
S-SQUARE ROOTS.

293
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,722
SQUARES.

294
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:06,227
N-NOT "ROOT"
LIKE A POTATO.

295
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,529
A ROUTE --
LIKE A HIGHWAY!

296
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,001
IT'S A ROUTE CIPHER.

297
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,171
SQUARES AND THEIR ROOTS --
THE NUMBERS WERE THE TELL.

298
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,500
SQUARES AND THEIR ROOTS.

BUT THE THREE STOOD APART,

300
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,073
MEANING YOU BREAK
EACH STRING OF LETTERS

301
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,765
INTO THREE EQUAL ROWS.

302
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,837
THEN YOU JUST -- YOU JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT THE ROUTE.

303
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,335
IT COULD BE
UP AND DOWN COLUMNS

304
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:24,476
OR IN A SPIRAL PATTERN --

305
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,711
DANIEL,
THIS IS FANTASTIC,

306
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,505
BUT CAN YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT IT SAYS?

307
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,517

CALL FIRST MONUMENT BANK,
HAVE THEM CLEAR THE BUILDING

312
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,058
AND WARN THEIR EMPLOYEES
NOT TO OPEN UP ANY MAIL.

00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,564
I'M GONNA GET
AN AMBULANCE OVER THERE.

314

TELL THEM TO BRING ATROPINE
AND PRALIDOXIME CHLORIDE

OPENED A PACKAGE
10 MINUTES AGO.

318
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,370
HE GOT BLASTED WITH SARIN.

319
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,744
HIS NAME'S RUSS ANDERSON.

320
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,413
HE'S ON HIS WAY
TO THE E.R.

321
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,781
IF I'D BEEN
10 MINUTES FASTER,

322
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,676
HE WOULD NOT BE LYING IN THERE
ON LIFE SUPPORT.

323
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,547
DANIEL,
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

324
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,256
OKAY, YOU DIDN'T
POISON THOSE MEN.

325
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,058
AND WE CAN STILL CATCH THE GUY
WHO DID THIS

326
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,590
BEFORE HE HITS
SOMEONE ELSE.

327
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,834
HAVE YOU GOTTEN AHOLD
OF MR. ANDERSON'S WIFE?

328

IF HE'LL LAST THAT LONG.

330
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,568
CAN WE TALK TO HIM?

331
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,942
HE'S GONE INTO A COMA.

332
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,712
THAT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY MEAN

333
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,609
WE CAN'T TRY TO ASK HIM
SOME QUESTIONS.

00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:17,582
NO, IT'S TRUE.

849
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,209
YEAH,
I'M WORKING FOR THE COPS,

850
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:21,575
BUT I BELIEVE IN WHAT
YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR, EDDIE.

851
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,823
I HATE LAWYERS, EDDIE,

852
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,849
AND -- AND --
AND CORPORATIONS

853
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:29,154
AND THE WAY THEY SCREW OVER
HARDWORKING, HONEST PEOPLE.

854
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,087
WHAT SCANTLIN AND ANDERSON
AND THE REST OF THOSE [BLEEP]

855
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,033
DID TO YOUR FAMILY
IS UNFORGIVABLE.

856
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,589
IT'S -- IT'S EVIL.

857
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:38,457
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'D
WANT TO MAKE THEM PAY. I DO.

858
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,425
BUT THESE PEOPLE
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

859
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:42,527
YES, THEY DID.

860
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,639
THEY RAISED A MONSTER.

861
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,442
THEY RAISED A SON THAT HAS
NO CONSCIENCE AT ALL.

862
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:52,175
AND YOUR FATHER
RAISED YOU,

863
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,050
AND YOU DO HAVE
A CONSCIENCE.

864
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,519
AND THAT'S THE REAL REASON THAT
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE, ISN'T IT?

865
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,448
'CAUSE DEEP DOWN,

866
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:00,124
YOU WANT ME TO STOP YOU
FROM KYOU'RE WRONG. ELSE.

867
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,751
YOU STARTED THIS, EDDIE,

868
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,257
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO MAKE
YOUR FATHER PROUD OF YOU.

869
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,860
HE STILL CAN BE.

870
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:09,761
NOBODY ELSE HAS TO DIE.
YOU'VE ALREADY FINISHED THE JOB.

871
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,225
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

872
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:14,873
DAFOE AND WEI
ARE GOING TO JAIL.

873
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,270
YOU'RE LYING.

874
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:17,772
NO, I'M NOT.

875
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:19,973
THANKS TO YOU, I FIGURED OUT
WHAT THEY WERE DOING

876
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,665
TO YOUR FATHER
AND THE OTHER FARMERS.

877
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,477
THE U.S. ATTORNEY
IS GONNA INDICT THEM.

878
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,039
THERE'LL BE LAWSUITS,
EDDIE.

879
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,406
SOME OF THOSE FARMERS
WILL GET THEIR LAND BACK.

880
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,575
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR MY FATHER AND ME.

881
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,724
WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD STILL
BE TOGETHER.

882
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:34,149
HOW? IN HELL?

883
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,915
I'LL TALK
TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY

884
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,164
ABOUT HAVING YOU SENTENCED
TO STATEVILLE.

885
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:41,489
I PROMISE.

886
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:43,797
NOW...

887
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:46,699
WHY DON'T YOU
PUT DOWN THAT DETONATOR,

888
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:49,872
AND LET'S WALK
OUT OF HERE TOGETHER.

889
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,741
IF I GO OUT THERE,

890
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,710
THE ONLY CELL THEY'RE GONNA
PUT ME IN IS ONE ON DEATH ROW.

891
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:01,213
AND I DESERVE TO DIE.

892
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,818
I KILLED AN INNOCENT GIRL.

893
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,821
YEAH, AND YOU CAN PAY
FOR THAT CRIME, EDDIE,

894
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:09,193
BUT NOT WITH YOUR LIFE.

895
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,690
THERE WERE MITIGATING
CIRCUMSTANCES.

896
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,192
YOU WERE TRAUMATIZED

897
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,733
BY WHAT DAFOE AND HIS CABAL
DID TO YOUR FAMILY,

898
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:14,829
AND I'LL TESTIFY TO THAT.

899
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,860
YOU LIED TO ME BEFORE.

900
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,067
HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT LYING TO ME NOW?

901
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,369
I GOT THE SHTAKE IT.

902
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,239
EDDIE,
GET AWAY FROM THAT WINDOW!

903
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,571
GOD!

904
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,520
WHY THE [BLEEP]
DID YOU DO THAT, HUH?

905
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:41,554
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
LET THEM KILL ME?

906
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:44,217
BECAUSE I MEANT
WHAT I SAID, EDDIE.

907
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,655
NOBODY ELSE HAS TO DIE.

908
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,743
I COULD STILL
PUSH THIS BUTTON.

909
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,609
YEAH, YOU CAN.

910
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:05,912
BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO.

911
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,204
COME ON. COME ON. COME ON.
WHAT THE [BLEEP] GOING ON?

912
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,910
HOLD YOUR FIRE!

913
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:38,282
HE'S SURRENDERING!

914
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,509
HE LEFT
THE DETONATOR INSIDE!

915
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:42,806
GO! GO! GO! GO!

916
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,648
[ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]

917
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,218
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,
EDDIE.

918
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:58,432
[ EDDIE GRUNTS ]

919
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,434
YEP.YOU OKAY?

920
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:01,626
YOU SURE?

921
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,797
YEAH. THAT --

922
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:05,435
THAT COULD HAVE GONE
A WHOLE DIFFERENT WAY.

923
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:06,811
I KNEW YOU WERE CRAZY.

924
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,508
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE THAT CRAZY.

925
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,440
YEAH. ME NEITHER.

926
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,552
Daniel:
WHAT IS A CONSCIENCE?

927
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:22,552
IS IT SOMETHING WE CAN LOCATE
ON AN MRI?

928
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,388
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

929
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,532
THAT PEOPLE WITH DAMAGE TO THE
VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX

930
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:31,459
ARE ACTUALLY MORE WILLING
TO SACRIFICE A HUMAN LIFE

931
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:36,967
AS LONG AS THEY PERCEIVE THAT
IT'S FOR SOME GREATER GOOD.

932
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,742
BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE
WHO HAVE NO TROUBLE

933
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,741
SACRIFICING OTHERS
TO THEIR OWN SELFISH ENDS?

934
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,114
IS HEARTLESS CRUELTY
OUR TRUE NATURE

935
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,484
AND EMPATHY THE ABERRATION?

936
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:51,684
MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO SAY,
"IT'S NICE TO BE NICE."

937
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:53,247
AND THAT MAY BE TRUE.

938
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,124
OR ARE WE BETTER OFF
SPENDING EVERY WAKING MOMENT

939
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:59,464
TENDING OUR OWN SELFISH NEEDS?

940
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:00,931
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

941
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,359
IT TURNS OUT THERE'S
AN EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE

942
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,204
TO SIMPLE HUMAN KINDNESS.

943
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,200
WE COULDN'T GET THROUGH
A COLD PALEOLITHIC WINTER

944
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,502
WITHOUT A LITTLE COOPERATION.

945
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:14,505
STILL, ON SOME PREHISTORIC LEVEL
WE'RE ALL LONE HUNTERS.

946
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,510
SO IT CAN FEEL DANGEROUS
TO SHOW ANY SOFTNESS

947
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:19,653
TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TRIBE.

948
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:28,293
BUT IF WE MANAGE TO LAY DOWN OUR
CLUBS AND OUR SHARPENED ROCKS,

949
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,589
ANSWERING THE CALL
OF THE ALTRUISTIC IMPERATIVE

950
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:36,355
CAN BE ITS OWN REWARD.
