Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:06,663
So, I went fishing this weekend.

3
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:10,144
Caught a huge striped bass.

4
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:12,879
This big.

5
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:16,374
We're having it mounted in my
office. Isn't that right, Mr. Lewicki?

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:19,795
Uh, whatever you say, Doc.

7
00:00:22,714 --> 00:00:26,367
All right. So, even if my
soon-to-be form teaching assistant

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,574
didn't roll over on me like a rat in a
bad Mafia flick, you'd know I was lying.

9
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:31,888
Why?

10
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:33,448
Because it's a fish story.

11
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:36,570
But if I was a better liar..

12
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:38,695
I'd have a huge advantage.

13
00:00:38,696 --> 00:00:42,425
Studies show the most convincing
liars land the best jobs,

14
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:45,374
make the most friends,
and get all the hot women.

15
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:50,816
So if I was really good at it, would
there still be a way for you to bust me?

16
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,400
A polygraph, maybe.

17
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:57,982
Did you discover a male
intruder in your home last night?

18
00:00:57,983 --> 00:00:59,843
Yes.

19
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,719
Do you know the identity of this man?

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,322
No.

21
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:06,415
Did you see his face?

22
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,276
Yes.

23
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:11,698
Can you describe it?

24
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:13,853
No.

25
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:19,950
A polygraph's not a bad tool, but
it only measures stress response.

26
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:24,342
In this class, we're interested
in what goes on in the brain.

27
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:26,671
And if we were to put
someone in an FMRI machine

28
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:29,115
and watch what happens
when they make up a lie,

29
00:01:29,116 --> 00:01:35,016
we'd see their Dorsolateral Prefrontal
cortex light up like a Christmas Tree..

30
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:37,662
Because we use our brains when we lie.

31
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:40,924
We use our brains when
we're being lied to.

32
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:42,845
But..

33
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:47,153
Can the brain ever lie to itself?

34
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:56,400
All right. So you've got office hours

35
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,136
from 1:00 to 3:00, and
don't forget the meeting

36
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:00,152
with Dean Haley and that
Hathaway guy at 4:00.

37
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,521
- Get me out of it.
- Oh, okay.

38
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,983
- What am I supposed to tell him?
- I don't know.

39
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:05,395
Use your Dorsolateral Prefrontal
cortex and make something up.

40
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:07,217
Okay, so you want me to lie for you now?

41
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:08,896
- Think of it as practice.
- For what?

42
00:02:08,897 --> 00:02:10,644
For landing a new job when I fire you

43
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:12,917
for not getting me out of
the meeting with Dean Haley.

44
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:14,131
Doc, that doesn't make any sense.

45
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:19,112
It's a paradox, Lewicki.
It's not supposed to.

46
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,333
Oh, my goodness! Oh, God! I'm so sorry.

47
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:23,648
In a bit of a hurry, aren't we?

48
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:25,357
I'm gonna pay for your
dry cleaning, okay?

49
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:27,247
My fault. I wasn't
looking where I was going.

50
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,583
In fact, could we please
make the lady another?

51
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:32,482
- No, it's fine.
- I insist.

52
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:33,986
Chamomile tea.

53
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,254
Good choice.

54
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,774
I don't think you
need any more caffeine.

55
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:41,409
Actually, the tea is for a friend,
and I can handle my caffeine just fine.

56
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,410
Thank you very much.

57
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,539
- How about your liquor?
- Excuse me?

58
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,821
Well, seeing as I'm buying the tea,

59
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:47,871
I thought maybe you
could buy me a real drink.

60
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:49,996
7:00's good for me.

61
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:55,897
Thank you for the tea, and again,
I'm very sorry about the shirt.

62
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:01,040
- Daniel.
- Kate.

63
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,913
What, am I on some sort
of government watch list?

64
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:04,467
Not yet.

65
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:08,188
Herbal tea. No milk, no sugar.

66
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,855
Now, I know you didn't come all the
way over here just to bring me tea.

67
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:16,904
Meet Frank and Olena Prentice.

68
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,162
Looks like he won the lottery.

69
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:20,179
Actually, she cost him a bundle.

70
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,662
Mail-order bride from the Ukraine.

71
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:22,821
People actually do that?

72
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:26,552
Yeah. Why? Are you in
the market for a wife?

73
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:28,353
No.

74
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:32,024
"Eastern Bloc Introductions".

75
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:35,961
They arranged for Frank to fly to
Odessa to meet with prospective brides.

76
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:38,397
Before you know it, wedding bells.

77
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:42,501
But Frank has to come home
while they wait for Olena's visa.

78
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:43,894
Immigration problems.

79
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,928
Then he gets a call from her broker
saying it's gonna be another 100 grand

80
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:48,707
to get Olena into the states.

81
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,102
Now, Frank doesn't
have that kind of cash.

82
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:54,044
So then the broker offers
him alternative financing.

83
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:55,414
Code for "loan shark".

84
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:56,432
Exactly.

85
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,584
So Frank gets his new bride, but
he can't keep up with the payments.

86
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:01,477
So then the loan shark
tells him that they're going

87
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:04,385
to take Olena and make
her work off the debt.

88
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:07,359
I'm guessing we're not talking
about a nice office job.

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,363
Alexei Tupelov.

90
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:11,964
Suspected of running
the largest prostitution

91
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:15,060
and loan-sharking
operations in the Midwest.

92
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:18,777
The Bureau's been trying to nail this
guy for years, but no one will testify.

93
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:23,035
He also happens to own
Eastern Bloc Introductions.

94
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:24,955
- So it's a front company.
- Yeah.

95
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,552
We think that the loan
shark's one of Tupelov's boys,

96
00:04:27,553 --> 00:04:29,933
and last night he made
good on his threat.

97
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:33,631
Frank comes home, sees a blue Camaro
parked right outside his house.

98
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,699
He goes inside. There's an intruder.

99
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,827
They fight.

100
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,370
The guy smashes Frank
over the head with a lamp.

101
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,637
The live-in maid comes home from her
night off, finds Frank unconscious,

102
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:46,472
calls the cops, but
Olena is already gone.

103
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:47,921
Poor girl.

104
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:49,842
Yeah.

105
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,109
How can I help?

106
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,482
Here's the thing.

107
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:58,702
Frank can't give us a description of this
guy, even though they were face to face.

108
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:00,993
Well, you said the intruder
hit him over the head.

109
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:02,793
That could certainly affect his memory.

110
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:05,530
That's why I brought this to
you. Frank's memory is fine.

111
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:09,146
He can describe everything that
happened last night in perfect detail,

112
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:15,047
so how is it that he can't tell
us what this guy looked like?

113
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,091
What the hell is that thing?

114
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:29,219
Whole-body-imaging scanner.

115
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,854
It wasn't here last time.

116
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:36,755
Yeah. New Security protocols.
I'll meet you on the other side.

117
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,200
Daniel!

118
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:19,636
Daniel! Where are you going?

119
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:21,739
Do you have any idea the
health risks those things pose?

120
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,716
Wh.. That? That's perfectly safe.

121
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,605
According to who? Some
government regulatory body?

122
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:27,868
Like I really trust Uncle Sam
to look out for my well-being.

123
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:30,077
Okay, listen, what exactly
is it that you're afraid of?

124
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:33,617
Skin cancer, thyroid
disease, mutated sperm.

125
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:34,586
M.. Mutated sperm?

126
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:36,193
Not to mention the violation of privacy.

127
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:41,274
I'm not about to let some $10-an-hour
rent-a-cop check out my testicular region.

128
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,212
Okay. You know what?

129
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:46,893
We're gonna do this
the old-fashioned way.

130
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,067
You're really enjoying this, aren't you?

131
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,838
Mr. Prentice, you told
the police that you

132
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,537
struggled with the intruder
for more than a minute,

133
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:58,566
that you were face-to-face
the whole time.

134
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:01,391
Any distinguishing
features or characteristics?

135
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:04,072
Well, I told them I've never
been too good with faces.

136
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:07,163
The intruder.. Was it the same
man you've been paying off?

137
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:09,810
Maybe. Well, they were
about the same size.

138
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:13,453
But the guy that shakes me down usually
wears one of those orthodox crosses..

139
00:07:13,454 --> 00:07:17,804
A gold one on a chain around his neck.

140
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,869
What does your wife look like?

141
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,115
You got pictures of her.

142
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:24,338
What does she look like to you?

143
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,133
Blond..

144
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:27,058
Good-looking.

145
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:28,650
She got a good body.

146
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:30,175
D.. Do you really think
I'm gonna spend all that

147
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:33,809
money to bring her over
here if she's not hot?

148
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,335
The husband's a real charmer.

149
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:36,682
We find this girl, and then what?

150
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:38,236
She has to go back to that?

151
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:40,748
Here. Put this on.

152
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:41,640
- Why?
- Just do it.

153
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:42,532
Okay.

154
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,925
And take these.

155
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:46,619
We're in the middle of an interrogation.

156
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,993
- What's going on?
- Go with me on this.

157
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:52,434
Now, let's do something about that hair.

158
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,082
Frank, this is Miss Jones.
She's a sketch artist.

159
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,746
She's gonna come up with a composite
of the man who attacked you.

160
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:07,852
I sure as hell hope you're
more help than that last girl.

161
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:10,130
You don't recognize her?

162
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,822
Why?

163
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:14,283
Have we met?

164
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:21,731
It's sensory impairment
called Prosopagnosia..

165
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:23,392
Also known as "face blindness".

166
00:08:23,393 --> 00:08:26,024
Even though Frank's vision is perfectly
normal, he can't recognize faces.

167
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,750
He probably couldn't pick his
own Mother out of a lineup.

168
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:30,204
Because of the blow to the head?

169
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:32,300
It can be caused by damage
to the Fusiform Gyrus,

170
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:34,137
but Frank said he'd never
been good with faces,

171
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,210
which means it's probably congenital.

172
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:38,052
Wait a second. This
guy's had this bizarro

173
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:40,782
condition his entire life,
and he doesn't know it?

174
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:41,900
How's that even possible?

175
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:44,459
Most Prosopagnosiacs develop
unconscious strategies

176
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,052
for recognizing the people they know..

177
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:51,111
The way they dress, the context
they see them in, their voice.

178
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:52,160
Great.

179
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,682
Well, according to Frank's
statement, the intruder never spoke,

180
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:58,251
so even if we find the guy,
our witness can't I.D. him.

181
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:01,080
Mm, Frank spoke to the loan
shark at least half a dozen times.

182
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,780
He'd be able to recognize his voice.

183
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:07,022
We find the loan shark, get
Daniel to help Frank I.D. him.

184
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:09,900
We grill his sorry ass until
he tells us where Olena is.

185
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,220
Can I go now?

186
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:13,445
Frank couldn't pick anybody
out of the photo array.

187
00:09:13,446 --> 00:09:17,937
How do we know which one of
Tupelov's guys to haul in?

188
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:23,838
How about we drop off Daniel back
at campus and go find you a wife?

189
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:28,198
We know that your company is
a front for Alexei Tupelov.

190
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:30,698
He's an investor. So?

191
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:33,771
So, you two are running quite a scam..

192
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:37,287
Rich American men foot the bill
for pretty young girls to emigrate.

193
00:09:37,288 --> 00:09:38,992
Then you shake the husbands down.

194
00:09:38,993 --> 00:09:42,756
And if they don't pay, you force their
immigrant wives into prostitution.

195
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:44,016
That's ridiculous.

196
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,424
Olena Prentice..

197
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:48,911
One of Tupelov's boys threatened to take
her as collateral, and now she's missing.

198
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:52,125
That sounds like conspiracy to
commit kidnapping and extortion to me.

199
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:54,926
Does that sound like
extortion to you, Roger?

200
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,623
It does, as a matter of fact.

201
00:09:56,624 --> 00:09:59,941
I don't know anything about
kidnapping or prostitution.

202
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:02,511
And if you ask me, Olena
went back to Ukraine.

203
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:05,105
You think she went home? Why?

204
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,509
A few weeks after she got here,

205
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,419
she called me to say that
Frank was very mean to her.

206
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,554
He did not let her leave the house.

207
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:14,556
So she wanted out.

208
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:17,360
So you helped her, of course.

209
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:22,025
I'm a marriage broker,
not a marriage counselor.

210
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:25,391
I told her to stick it
out, to stay a few years,

211
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:29,041
then divorce him, take his money.
It's the American way, right?

212
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,537
There is an innocent young
girl missing who came to

213
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,842
this country trying to make
a better life for herself.

214
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:36,177
You are responsible for
bringing her here, and you

215
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:40,140
couldn't be bothered to
help her when she asked.

216
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,998
What do you want from me?

217
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,699
I want the name of the man
who was shaking Frank down.

218
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,179
What makes you think that I..

219
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,538
If you don't give me a name,
this place is gonna be swarming

220
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:52,528
with I.C.E. Agents,
U.S. attorneys, I.R.S.

221
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,829
You will go to federal
prison, kicking yourself

222
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,730
for not cooperating with that nice girl
from the FBI when you had the chance.

223
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:03,736
Yuri Petrovich?

224
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,670
Special Agent Moretti, FBI.

225
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:07,802
Oh, FBI, huh?

226
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:09,347
I must be moving up in the world.

227
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:12,416
We're looking for a missing
woman.. Olena Prentice.

228
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,626
I got all the women I need right here.

229
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:16,353
Never heard of no Olena.

230
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:18,053
Yeah, that's funny, because
you've been shaking down

231
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:21,418
her husband, Frank, threatening
to turn out his wife.

232
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,832
Okay, thanks.

233
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,097
A body matching the
description of Olena Prentice

234
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:27,936
was just found in a
landfill out by Midway.

235
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:33,837
Congratulations, Yuri. You just became the
prime suspect in a murder investigation.

236
00:11:35,886 --> 00:11:36,997
Paul, you wanted to see..

237
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:40,623
Daniel! Perfect timing. Come in.
Say hello to Dr. Michael Hathaway.

238
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:43,044
I've been trying to convince Michael
to bring his talents to the South side

239
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:45,674
and become the newest member
of our esteemed faculty.

240
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:47,869
It's an honor.

241
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,507
Right.

242
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,516
Right. You're the uh..

243
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,873
Famous self-help Sage to the stars.

244
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:57,214
Well, my academic specialty's
behavioral science, of course.

245
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:59,044
The "Sage" part was my publicists' idea.

246
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:03,371
I fought them on it, but it moved
some books, so what do I know?

247
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:06,937
You know, Michael's had a New York
Times bestseller three years running.

248
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:09,422
- Is that right?
- I've read all your books.

249
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:12,512
Yeah, in fact, when Paul rang with
his offer, I said I'd only consider it

250
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:14,509
if it meant a chance to work with you.

251
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,350
Uh, I read your last book, too.

252
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:24,613
It was brilliant..
W.. Wasn't it, Daniel?

253
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:28,785
No. No. I.. I thought it was a
muddled mess of shoddy research,

254
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:30,600
junk science, and pedantic platitudes,

255
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,576
but I hope you enjoy
your time in Chicago.

256
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:37,723
If you'll excuse me, I have some
actual scholarship to attend to.

257
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,704
Right.

258
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:43,264
Doc.

259
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:45,429
Doc.

260
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,358
Oh, I went to the damn meeting. What
the hell else do you want from me?

261
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:53,557
Agent Moretti called, says they
want you to help I.D. a suspect.

262
00:12:53,558 --> 00:12:58,238
All right. Get the
car. I'll get my coat.

263
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:04,918
Hello, Dr. Pierce.

264
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,337
May I help you?

265
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:12,178
Maybe I can help you, Professor.

266
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:15,846
Friendly advice..
Won't cost you nothing.

267
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:19,838
It's better for everyone..
You, especially..

268
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,577
If you don't help FBI
on this case no more.

269
00:13:24,578 --> 00:13:25,942
How do you know I'm..

270
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:29,963
We have many friends, even at FBI.

271
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:34,735
You have a mole.

272
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:36,592
A mole.

273
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:39,376
We're not KGB, but, yes..

274
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:43,037
I suppose you could say this.

275
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:47,817
I hear you are a very
smart man, Professor.

276
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:50,664
So I think you know..

277
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:56,065
It is not healthy for you
to work with these people.

278
00:13:57,155 --> 00:14:02,555
After all, you don't want
to also disappear, do you?

279
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:15,965
Do any of these men remind you of the
man who threatened to hurt your wife?

280
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:20,646
Anything stand out?
Hands, hairline, posture?

281
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:26,014
Number 2.

282
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,108
Why him?

283
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:31,653
I recognize that widow's peak,
those scrawny, bowed legs.

284
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:34,047
I want that bastard to pay
for what he did to my wife.

285
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:36,553
- That's good.
- It's the same guy whose voice you I.D.'d.

286
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:39,426
Daniel, can you testify in court
that the visual I.D. is valid

287
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:42,784
despite Mr. Prentice's condition?

288
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:45,455
Daniel. Yes or no? Is the I.D. solid?

289
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:48,996
Yes, I.. I'll stand by it.

290
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,380
I'm gonna lay it out for you, Yuri.

291
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:58,061
You got priors.. Pimping,
extortion, assault.

292
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:01,993
Frank Prentice just fingered you as the
man who threatened to abduct his wife.

293
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:04,453
She disappeared. Now she's dead.

294
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:06,230
What do you make?

295
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:09,173
$40,000, $45,000 a year?

296
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,294
You're a hot little spinner.

297
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:14,164
Come work for me. You
could earn some real money.

298
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:17,167
An innocent girl was killed, Yuri.

299
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:19,527
Now, in addition to the fact
that it really pisses me off,

300
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,086
it's also murder during
the commission of a felony.

301
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,703
Do you know what that means?

302
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,326
Death penalty.

303
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:31,847
And I for one am not gonna
be crying at your funeral.

304
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:34,576
But maybe..

305
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:37,719
You didn't mean to kill her.

306
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,100
Yeah, the medical examiner says that she
died from a blow to the base of the skull.

307
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:45,084
Maybe she was trying to get away.

308
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:47,340
Maybe she fell, hit her head.

309
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:49,325
Now you're only looking at
involuntary manslaughter.

310
00:15:49,326 --> 00:15:51,134
You might only do 18 months.

311
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:54,071
You're offering me a deal,
just because you're sweet on me?

312
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:56,095
You're too small for me, Yuri..

313
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:59,410
In more ways than one, I would bet.

314
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:02,951
No, I want something bigger.

315
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:04,579
I want Alexei Tupelov.

316
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,380
Oh.

317
00:16:06,451 --> 00:16:08,046
Bitch, what are you smoking?

318
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:11,154
I rat out Tupelov, I might
as well get the death penalty.

319
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:13,075
Okay.

320
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:14,959
We've already got you on the extortion.

321
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,370
It's up to five years for each count.

322
00:16:18,371 --> 00:16:22,631
I hope you enjoy your stay at Marion.

323
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:25,119
Do you think he's gonna give us Tupelov?

324
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,786
It would help if we could
connect him to the crime scene.

325
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,747
Any luck on the blue Camaro?

326
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,842
Yuri drives an Escalade.

327
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:34,147
I doubt Yuri and his boys
would be stupid enough

328
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:38,648
to commit kidnapping
in a registered car.

329
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,406
Everything all right, Dr. Pierce?

330
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:53,047
Yes, I'm fine.

331
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:57,301
That pendant.

332
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,012
Yuri Petrovich has one just like it.

333
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:02,542
Well, I grew up with a lot
of the guys in Tupelov's crew.

334
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:06,933
That's why I was picked
for the task force.

335
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:10,114
So, what do you think?

336
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:13,635
Did Yuri really kill Olena?

337
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:15,743
Who else could have done it?

338
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,690
Well, let's just say some friends
of mine would be very grateful

339
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:23,031
if you didn't help Moretti
pin this murder on Yuri.

340
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:24,161
You're the mole.

341
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:27,082
No. Not me, Professor.

342
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,575
But you're right. There is a mole.

343
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:32,436
Who?

344
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,693
Daniel.

345
00:17:36,637 --> 00:17:38,842
Give you a lift back?

346
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:39,843
Yeah.

347
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:42,544
- Great.
- Sure.

348
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,368
You're being threatened
by a Russian mobster,

349
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:49,735
and you don't bother
mentioning it to Kate?

350
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,185
Why not?

351
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:54,242
Because he's probably
a damned hallucination..

352
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:57,778
The same as the lady Agent
turned out to be. I just..

353
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,394
I don't want Kate to think I'm bonkers.

354
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:01,292
Well, if you're so convinced
that he wasn't real,

355
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:03,799
why do you keep looking out the window?!

356
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,211
Because I might be wrong!

357
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:08,830
W.. What if there really is a goon
out there waiting to break my kneecaps?

358
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:11,833
Daniel, you and I both
know that feeling threatened

359
00:18:11,834 --> 00:18:14,846
by a criminal conspiracy
straight out of a spy novel

360
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:18,687
is classic schizophrenic delusion.

361
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:21,510
What's more plausible..
That there's a fiendish plot

362
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:27,411
with mobsters and corrupt FBI
agents or that you're imagining it?

363
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:34,454
Thank you for being here.

364
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:37,155
That's what friends are for.

365
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:39,628
You said this thug told
you that it wasn't healthy

366
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:42,734
for you to keep working for the FBI.

367
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:45,201
It sounds like a
manifestation of your anxiety

368
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:47,285
about getting involved with these cases,

369
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:51,417
because you know they get you off
your routine and trigger episodes.

370
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:54,535
He also said I might
disappear. What's that about?

371
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:58,233
Last time you checked into Rexford,
you didn't tell anybody where you were..

372
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:59,918
Your friends, your students.

373
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,767
You just disappeared out of their lives.

374
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,438
So, I'm not afraid
of Ukrainian gangsters

375
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:09,939
so much as orderlies
with butterfly nets?

376
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,643
You're not going back to the hospital.

377
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:17,947
You have me, you have Lewicki,
and you're managing your condition.

378
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,114
Some days I manage better than others.

379
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:22,919
Your symptoms are more
acute when your subconscious

380
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,901
is working on a problem
that it can't quite solve.

381
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:31,157
The Ukrainian guy said there was a mole.

382
00:19:31,158 --> 00:19:33,177
Now, it's not the Agent, obviously.

383
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:36,181
Well, maybe it's a
riddle. What's a mole?

384
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:40,620
A spy, an imposter, someone
who hides in plain sight.

385
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:43,048
But there's another kind of mole..

386
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,949
The kind that burrows underground.

387
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:50,228
Moles are blind.

388
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:51,891
Do you know what time it is?

389
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:54,287
Yuri didn't kill Olena Prentice.

390
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:55,697
Wha..

391
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:59,118
What? You woke me up at..

392
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:02,249
3:18 A.M.

393
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,795
To accuse me of trying to coerce a
confession out of an innocent man?

394
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:10,708
That scumbag is anything but innocent,
but that does not make him the killer.

395
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,647
Okay, Daniel. If the lying,
pimping, sadistic felon who

396
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:17,437
threatened to abduct Olena
didn't kill her, then who did?

397
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:18,782
Her husband.

398
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,200
He passed a polygraph.

399
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,553
He's face-blind! For all we know, he..

400
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,482
He killed his own wife
without realizing it was her.

401
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:29,393
But you just proved that
Prosopagnosiacs can I.D. people

402
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,320
by their voice or their
posture or whatever.

403
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:33,813
He would have known his own wife.

404
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:37,172
Maybe she was wearing
some kind of disguise.

405
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:40,511
What is this? Is this,
like, a spy novel?

406
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:43,129
Don't.. I'm just..

407
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,997
I'm just saying.. I'm
just saying it's possible.

408
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:47,944
Okay, Daniel. Why would Olena
have been wearing a disguise?

409
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:50,062
I don't know. Maybe she was
trying to get away from him.

410
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:52,347
You said yourself how awful he is.

411
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:55,552
The marriage broker did
say that she wanted out.

412
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:58,431
You see? You see? So she runs away.

413
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:01,747
Frank realizes that.. That
his prized possession is gone,

414
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:05,895
after all the debt he's run up and threats
he's endured from Yuri.. All of it for her.

415
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:08,927
So he tracks the ungrateful
bitch down, and he kills her.

416
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:10,842
Except there's a flaw in your theory.

417
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:13,424
If Frank killed his wife for the
reasons that you just laid out,

418
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:15,972
he would have known that it
was her who he was killing,

419
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:18,498
and he wouldn't have passed
a poly, face-blind or not.

420
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:21,400
Right. So, uh, Frank
thought she was kidnapped,

421
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:24,796
so maybe he didn't
realize that she'd run away

422
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,460
until after he took the polygraph.

423
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:30,882
Then.. Then he figures out the truth,
and he tracks her down, and he kills her.

424
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:32,063
Nice.

425
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:36,221
Except the medical examiner puts her
time of death before he took the exam.

426
00:21:36,222 --> 00:21:38,920
Okay. So.. So.. The.. The..

427
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:40,859
Okay. Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

428
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,610
No, I just.. You know..
Go.. Go back to that.

429
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:46,165
I'm sure you'll sleep the
sleep of the just knowing that..

430
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,453
That the puzzle's been solved

431
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:49,905
and that you've nailed the
right guy for the murder.

432
00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:52,077
Well, I am awake already.

433
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:54,309
Well, then, let's go.

434
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,390
I'm gonna put some pants on first.

435
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:03,252
Your apartment's nice.

436
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:09,373
May I help you?

437
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:13,098
Special Agent Moretti,
FBI. This is Dr. Pierce.

438
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:16,803
And you are, uh, Masha, the
Prentices' housekeeper, correct?

439
00:22:16,804 --> 00:22:19,324
Yes. Come in.

440
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,692
So, you're the one who found
Mr. Prentice unconscious?

441
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:27,553
Yes.

442
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:30,446
Come home from movies.

443
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:34,047
See him on floor with blood.

444
00:22:34,357 --> 00:22:36,244
First I think he is dead.

445
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:37,276
And Olena?

446
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:38,718
I call ambulance.

447
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:41,423
Then I look for her. She's not here.

448
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:42,895
I see you're packing.

449
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:47,989
I send Olena's clothes to her sisters
in Ukraine, then I find other job.

450
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,707
You won't be staying
on with Mr. Prentice?

451
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:55,708
Olena speak little English.
They hire me so I translate.

452
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,805
Now she's gone.

453
00:22:57,806 --> 00:23:00,597
Olena didn't have any
family here in the states?

454
00:23:00,598 --> 00:23:03,649
She have Cousin.. Paulina.

455
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,287
She come here to visit
before I work here, but..

456
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,862
Mr. Prentice not like
her, tell her to go away.

457
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:14,432
Doesn't sound like Olena was
very happy with Mr. Prentice.

458
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:17,265
Mr. Prentice not let her go anywhere.

459
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:21,917
He say it is not safe, but he
work always until very late.

460
00:23:21,918 --> 00:23:25,638
Until I come, Olena was alone.

461
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:30,141
Did he ever hurt her?

462
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,202
Sometimes he hit her.

463
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:40,361
Do you think it's possible
she wasn't kidnapped..

464
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,380
That maybe she ran away?

465
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,797
But..

466
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:47,532
There was Ukrainian man
arrested for her murder, no?

467
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:49,573
Daniel.

468
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:54,905
"Thanks for taking care of this, baby.

469
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:57,545
Hugs and kisses. Jolene".

470
00:23:57,546 --> 00:24:00,066
Who's Jolene?

471
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,880
I never hear this name.

472
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:08,701
Well, whoever she is, Frank's
paying her credit-card bills.

473
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:15,465
Jolene Grey?

474
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:18,015
I'm Special Agent Moretti.
This is Dr. Daniel Pierce.

475
00:24:18,016 --> 00:24:20,151
Thank you for agreeing
to come talk to us.

476
00:24:20,152 --> 00:24:24,839
I'll tell you whatever you want to
know, but, please, don't tell my husband.

477
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,090
Okay.

478
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:30,426
You cooperate with us, and, uh, we'll
do what we can to keep things discreet.

479
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,707
Thank you.

480
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:37,843
Now, this is some tab
you've run up here.

481
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:42,669
Fancy hotels, jewelry, cash advances.

482
00:24:44,412 --> 00:24:46,247
I lost my wallet a few months ago.

483
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:49,368
Someone must have stolen my
I.D. and opened this account.

484
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:52,530
Yeah, see, that's not really the
way identity theft works, Jolene.

485
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:54,793
Criminals run up tabs
under someone else's name,

486
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:57,158
and then they don't pay the bill.

487
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,018
I'm telling you, these
aren't my charges.

488
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:02,296
My husband took away my
credit cards last year.

489
00:25:02,297 --> 00:25:04,971
So you got another one..
Paid for every month

490
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:07,533
with checks from Frank
Prentice's business account.

491
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:09,228
I don't know any Frank Prentice.

492
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:11,354
I thought you were
gonna cooperate, Jolene.

493
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:13,101
Now, according to
your cellphone records,

494
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:16,256
you've called Frank several times
a day for the past few months.

495
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:19,462
I'm on a family plan.
My husband pays the bill.

496
00:25:19,463 --> 00:25:22,769
So you got a second phone,
reserved for a special caller.

497
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,812
After all, you wouldn't want Frank's
number showing up on your husband's bill.

498
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:30,345
Or maybe you were
jealous of Frank's wife.

499
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:31,932
Maybe used one of those cash advances to

500
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:34,448
pay someone to make
Olena Prentice disappear.

501
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,847
I don't know what you're talking about.

502
00:25:36,848 --> 00:25:39,968
Check out those heels.

503
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:44,705
Must have cost her a fortune.

504
00:25:44,706 --> 00:25:46,723
Tell me the truth, Jolene.

505
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:48,796
Where did you get those shoes?

506
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:52,232
- Daniel?
- They're beautiful.

507
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,731
Thank you. Marshall Field's.

508
00:25:54,732 --> 00:25:56,741
Did you pay cash for them?

509
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes. How did you..

510
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:02,076
Well, your husband
took your credit cards.

511
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:04,941
Jolene, do you sometimes buy things

512
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:10,102
to make yourself feel
better.. Clothing or jewelry?

513
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:14,054
I am so sorry.

514
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:20,213
And did you need those shoes so badly
that you stole money to buy them?

515
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:22,074
Yes.

516
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,757
I thought that's what this was about.

517
00:26:24,758 --> 00:26:26,625
I'll pay back every penny.

518
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:30,346
Please. Don't tell my husband.

519
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:34,958
Compulsive buying disorder.

520
00:26:37,704 --> 00:26:40,147
One of our agents showed
Jolene's photo to the desk clerk

521
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:41,997
at the hotel where
the gold card was used.

522
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:44,225
Said he's never seen her before.

523
00:26:44,226 --> 00:26:48,967
But a different woman checked in regularly
using Jolene's name, met Frank there.

524
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:50,961
Both women have black hair,
but according to the desk clerk,

525
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:53,665
the other one is "way hotter".

526
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:56,778
I was right the first time.
"Mole" means "imposter".

527
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:58,259
What are you talking about?

528
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,791
Maybe this imposter got
herself a wig or a dye job,

529
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:05,914
did something to make herself look enough
like Jolene's driver's-license photo

530
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:10,655
to fool anyone who
didn't look too closely.

531
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,969
She made charges every
Tuesday and Thursday last month

532
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,979
at a place called the Red Rabble.

533
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,725
That's a bar off I-90.

534
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:31,786
And today's Thursday.

535
00:27:39,568 --> 00:27:43,479
That's right, Professor.
I'm following you.

536
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,459
How do you like my new American car?

537
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,194
Daniel?

538
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:51,283
What's going on?

539
00:27:51,284 --> 00:27:52,884
Look.

540
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:54,370
A blue Camaro.

541
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:58,169
The same type of car parked outside
of Olena's the night she disappeared.

542
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,450
Excuse me!

543
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:02,616
Hi, everybody!

544
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:04,809
Listen, I..

545
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:10,683
Was backing up in the parking lot, and
I kind of sort of hit a blue Camaro.

546
00:28:10,684 --> 00:28:16,316
So whosever car that is, I will totally
pay for the damage, and I am so sorry.

547
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:19,377
Yeah, that's my car.

548
00:28:20,076 --> 00:28:21,323
How bad is it?

549
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,451
It's pretty bad.

550
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,812
FBI. You're under arrest.

551
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:28,903
I didn't..

552
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:32,321
- What for? I didn't..
- Just come with me. Come on.

553
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:36,460
I was there, but I didn't kill Olena.

554
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,921
I loved her.

555
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:43,753
I got a side gig
installing satellite dishes.

556
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:45,834
It pays for my music.

557
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:49,319
A couple months ago, I put
in a dish at Olena's house.

558
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,357
She was lonely.

559
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:53,921
We talked and started seeing each other.

560
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:55,277
She would never spend the night.

561
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:57,689
She always had to get
home before Frank did.

562
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,340
She told me that she
was gonna leave him.

563
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:02,847
Well, maybe you realized
that was never gonna happen,

564
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,310
so you got angry and you killed her.

565
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:09,160
No! No, she was supposed to
come over and never showed.

566
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:10,915
She didn't pick up her phone.

567
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,192
I got scared that Frank maybe found
out about us and maybe he hurt her.

568
00:29:14,193 --> 00:29:15,485
I drove over.

569
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:18,672
No one answered the door, so I broke in.

570
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,719
But Olena wasn't there.

571
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,971
And then Frank came in.

572
00:29:22,972 --> 00:29:24,468
And he turned on the lights.

573
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:28,062
He rushed me, so I grabbed
a lamp and I hit him.

574
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:29,845
And then I got the hell out of there.

575
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:34,338
That's a very compelling story, Jake,
except it doesn't explain one thing.

576
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,076
How does Jolene Grey fit in?

577
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:38,369
Who?

578
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,016
Super-hottie, black hair.

579
00:29:41,017 --> 00:29:44,720
Comes to see you play every
Thursday night at the Red Rabble.

580
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:46,859
Lots of people come to hear us.

581
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,804
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

582
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:51,559
Except Jolene was having an
affair with Olena's husband, Frank.

583
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,462
Now, it cannot just be a coincidence.

584
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:58,200
I bet you know who the mole is now.

585
00:29:58,201 --> 00:30:01,075
I don't know any Jolene Grey.

586
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:03,021
Actually, you do.

587
00:30:03,022 --> 00:30:06,682
You.. You know her intimately.

588
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,806
Mr. Prentice, can you
help us I.D. this woman?

589
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:18,141
No. Who is she?

590
00:30:18,142 --> 00:30:20,301
There anything about her
that's familiar to you?

591
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:21,602
Her hair, maybe?

592
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:23,987
No. Why.. Why would I..

593
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:28,528
You've been having an affair
with this woman for months.

594
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:29,449
That's bullshit.

595
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:34,472
Well, maybe her name will
ring a bell.. Jolene Grey?

596
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:35,718
No. I.. I don't know.

597
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:41,619
You've been paying off her
credit cards. We have the records.

598
00:30:43,564 --> 00:30:47,501
Okay, so I bought
Jolene some nice stuff.

599
00:30:47,502 --> 00:30:50,603
What? Are you saying
somebody killed her?

600
00:30:50,604 --> 00:30:54,207
Actually, the real Jolene
Grey is very much alive.

601
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,122
Yeah, she lives out in
the 'burbs with her family.

602
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:58,301
This woman stole her identity.

603
00:30:58,302 --> 00:31:01,076
She wore a wig to make sure
you wouldn't recognize her..

604
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:03,565
Very much like this one.

605
00:31:03,566 --> 00:31:07,406
I'll bet you recognize her now.

606
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,493
You put a wig on a
corpse? What kind of sick..

607
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,561
That's Olena.

608
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:16,902
You were having an affair
with your own wife, Frank.

609
00:31:17,532 --> 00:31:18,778
That's not possible.

610
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:19,999
Actually, it is.

611
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,583
Olena must have figured out over
time that you were face-blind,

612
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:25,886
so she stole another woman's
identity and seduced you.

613
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:27,808
She was practically a
prisoner in your home,

614
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:31,761
so she used your condition against
you to bilk you for cash, jewels.

615
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:33,927
I think she was probably
trying to save up enough

616
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:37,276
money to get away from
you, but, uh, turns out

617
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:40,905
you weren't the only
one she was screwing.

618
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:41,895
What?

619
00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:44,002
Yeah, turns out while
you were away at work,

620
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:47,982
she was banging the guy who
installed your satellite dish.

621
00:31:47,983 --> 00:31:50,012
He told us all about it.

622
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:51,257
That bitch.

623
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:53,495
You can't really blame her
for wanting a boy toy when she

624
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:56,686
was having to sleep with
you as herself and as Jolene.

625
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:58,670
Olena was never abducted, Frank.

626
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:00,395
The reason nobody could
find her is that when you

627
00:32:00,396 --> 00:32:02,265
killed the woman you
thought was your mistress,

628
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:05,255
you'd really just
murdered your own wife.

629
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,862
T.. This is ridiculous.

630
00:32:06,863 --> 00:32:12,763
Hotel desk clerk puts you in the same
room as her on the day of the murder.

631
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:22,448
It was an accident.

632
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:25,206
I never meant to kill her.

633
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:30,007
Tell us what happened.
Maybe I can help you.

634
00:32:31,456 --> 00:32:33,532
I tried to end it with her.

635
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:36,293
She was bleeding me dry. I
couldn't afford her any more.

636
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:39,194
I told her I was gonna need the
jewelry back to pay off Yuri,

637
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:42,635
or else he was gonna take Olena.

638
00:32:42,636 --> 00:32:44,885
But Jolene wouldn't listen, you know?

639
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:49,026
No. Said she was nothing without me.

640
00:32:49,331 --> 00:32:51,505
Then she started to hit me.

641
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:53,846
I lost it.

642
00:32:59,161 --> 00:33:02,161
What about the body?

643
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:05,211
I waited until after
dark, took her down in the

644
00:33:05,212 --> 00:33:10,325
maintenance elevator, and
tossed her in the dumpster.

645
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:15,666
It's too bad we can't
charge you with two murders.

646
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:17,928
Daniel.

647
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,168
Oh, hey, Paul.

648
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:21,219
Don't "hey, Paul" me.

649
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,802
You know, you really
blew it with Hathaway.

650
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:25,033
Why would you want a fraud like
that on the faculty, anyway?

651
00:33:25,034 --> 00:33:26,822
That fraud is an academic superstar.

652
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:28,588
Everybody wants him..
Harvard, Northwestern..

653
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,359
But I am gonna get him, and
you're gonna help me do it.

654
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,295
Here.

655
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:33,929
What's this? Cubs tickets.

656
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,033
Now, you're gonna apologize to Hathaway,

657
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:38,516
and you're gonna invite him to
tonight's game as a peace offering.

658
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,304
- Like hell I will.
- Come on, Daniel.

659
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:44,565
I really need you to do this for me.

660
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:52,823
Come on, man. You love the Cubbies.

661
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:57,047
Daniel.

662
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:59,072
Kate. Hi.

663
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:02,983
Frank Prentice is taking a plea
and cooperating against Yuri.

664
00:34:02,984 --> 00:34:03,889
That's great.

665
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,729
And if we can get Yuri
to roll on Tupelov,

666
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,350
then we'll have the Ukrainians
and Olena's killer in one shot.

667
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:11,865
Do you like baseball?

668
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:16,807
Yeah, sure. I mean, who doesn't like a cold
beer and a hot dog at a ballgame, right?

669
00:34:16,808 --> 00:34:19,559
Well, I.. I, uh, just happen to have

670
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,338
two, uh, two tickets to
the Cubs game tonight.

671
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:26,939
That sounds great. What time?

672
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:40,865
Have fun.

673
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:42,448
Wait, you're not going?

674
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,549
Uh, no.

675
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,254
Crowds drive me crazy.

676
00:34:47,255 --> 00:34:49,055
Ah.

677
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:52,934
Thanks.

678
00:34:54,404 --> 00:34:55,476
Are you stalking me?

679
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:56,477
Oh, my God.

680
00:34:56,478 --> 00:34:57,694
Hi.

681
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,204
I could ask you the same question.

682
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:01,133
Last chance to buy me that drink.

683
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,783
I leave town tomorrow.

684
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,046
Uh, you know, I'm sorry.

685
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:06,948
I don't think I can. I have plans.

686
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:09,649
But travel safe.

687
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,214
Actually, um..

688
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:20,035
Do you like baseball?

689
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,872
Why didn't you take Kate?

690
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:28,452
Because I'd rather watch it on TV..

691
00:35:28,453 --> 00:35:29,961
With you.

692
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:33,322
Something's bothering you.

693
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:35,082
It's Olena.

694
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:39,193
I just.. I can't figure out how a
young girl who barely spoke English

695
00:35:39,194 --> 00:35:41,691
pulled off such a complicated scam.

696
00:35:41,692 --> 00:35:43,924
I guess she had everyone fooled.

697
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:45,387
Foul ball down the third-base side.

698
00:35:45,388 --> 00:35:47,029
Out of play.

699
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,307
Whoa. Great catch by that fan.

700
00:35:50,308 --> 00:35:52,560
I don't believe it.

701
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:53,960
She took that asshole?

702
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:55,394
And he catches a foul ball.

703
00:35:55,395 --> 00:35:59,198
You know how many games I went to as a
kid, and I never once caught a foul ball?

704
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,218
Daniel, you have no one
to blame but yourself.

705
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:03,582
That could have been you.

706
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:08,143
But instead, you let
him take your place.

707
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:13,501
She took her place.

708
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:16,192
There's another mole.

709
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:18,981
What are you talking about?

710
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:20,024
Who are you calling?

711
00:36:20,025 --> 00:36:21,187
Kate.

712
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:22,626
Are you trying to ruin her date?

713
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:24,427
No.

714
00:36:24,654 --> 00:36:28,914
I'm gonna tell her Olena isn't dead.

715
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:37,177
You taking everything?

716
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:39,923
Mrs. Prentice is dead, and
Mr. Prentice go to jail, so..

717
00:36:39,924 --> 00:36:41,869
It's okay. No one's
accusing you of stealing.

718
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:45,709
It all belongs to you,
anyway, doesn't it..

719
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,690
Olena?

720
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,751
Listen, Frank Prentice is a pig.

721
00:36:49,752 --> 00:36:51,399
We don't blame you for
wanting to make him pay.

722
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,893
What we couldn't figure out was
how you did it all on your own.

723
00:36:54,894 --> 00:36:56,149
I don't know what you're talking..

724
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:02,050
I remembered you mentioned a Cousin
that Frank didn't like.. Paulina.

725
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:06,522
Ever since we were little girls
in Ukraine, Paulina protect me.

726
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:10,477
And now she protected you from Frank.

727
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,202
She married American,
too, five years before,

728
00:37:13,203 --> 00:37:16,380
but she divorce him, stay in country.

729
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:19,085
I call her, ask her to come.

730
00:37:19,086 --> 00:37:22,034
It was so good to see her.

731
00:37:22,035 --> 00:37:24,543
She stayed for a few days.

732
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:27,499
But soon we notice something strange.

733
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,360
My husband sometimes..
He think Paulina is me.

734
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:48,714
When next time she come to visit, he not
recognize her, even though he know her.

735
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:51,084
That's when she realized
he was face-blind.

736
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:53,855
And she make plan to get his money.

737
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:58,214
But first she need new name
so he doesn't get suspicious.

738
00:37:58,215 --> 00:38:01,815
So she steal wallet at mall,

739
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:07,622
and she make herself look
like woman on driving license.

740
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:12,029
He's not used to beautiful
woman paying attention to him,

741
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:17,070
so he give her money,
jewels, anything she want.

742
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,480
For me, it get worse.

743
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:22,255
I want to run away.

744
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:26,849
But Paulina say we have to wait
until we get all Frank's money

745
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,838
and that she have new
plan to protect me.

746
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:36,739
I give her haircut, and I give
her my clothes and my perfume.

747
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,330
Paulina is stronger than me.

748
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:43,792
She make Frank stop hitting her..

749
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:49,693
And she convince Frank to hire
Ukrainian maid to keep her company.

750
00:38:50,627 --> 00:38:55,189
So Paulina became you and
Jolene, and you became the maid.

751
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,144
It's an ingenious plan.

752
00:38:57,145 --> 00:39:00,324
You are going to arrest me.

753
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:01,874
You're an accessory to fraud.

754
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:05,734
The U.S. attorney's office might want to
charge you, but I'll do my best to convince

755
00:39:05,735 --> 00:39:08,117
them that being married
to an abusive, cheating

756
00:39:08,118 --> 00:39:12,378
murderer was probably punishment enough.

757
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,726
Thank you.

758
00:39:15,727 --> 00:39:19,978
But my husband will find
out what we did to him and..

759
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:23,009
When he leave prison, he will
find me, and without Paulina..

760
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,152
You were threatened by a known
associate of the Tupelov organization.

761
00:39:26,153 --> 00:39:29,402
I can make a pretty good case that
you belong in Witness Protection.

762
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:34,803
You'll get a fresh start,
Olena. New name, new life.

763
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:37,955
Daniel!

764
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:39,720
Paul, look, I know you're upset.

765
00:39:39,721 --> 00:39:42,329
Upset? No, no, no. I don't
know what you said to Hathaway,

766
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,095
but suddenly he is in
love with this town.

767
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:48,709
He's taking the job.
You did good, buddy.

768
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:53,270
Walt Whitman wrote,
"I contain multitudes".

769
00:39:53,537 --> 00:39:55,554
Turns out he was more
right than he knew.

770
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:59,607
The self is really a collection of
several distinct neural networks,

771
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:02,577
all running on this glob
of jelly between our ears.

772
00:40:02,578 --> 00:40:05,346
So, if there are different
versions of yourself

773
00:40:05,347 --> 00:40:11,247
floating around inside your
skull, which one is the real you?

774
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:16,597
Are you the lead guitarist,
rocking out once a week?

775
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,350
Or is it your 9:00-to-5:00..

776
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,531
That truly defines you?

777
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:30,037
Can one of those selves
be a devoted spouse..

778
00:40:30,038 --> 00:40:34,383
And the other a lying,
thieving, out-of-control addict?

779
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:36,587
Can you long for love..

780
00:40:36,588 --> 00:40:39,189
And yet still be cursed by
genetics and the environment

781
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:44,255
and remain the same son of
a bitch you've always been?

782
00:40:44,256 --> 00:40:49,536
And even if you do change
something about yourself..

783
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,191
Your face..

784
00:40:52,192 --> 00:40:54,532
Your name..

785
00:40:55,908 --> 00:40:58,608
Where you live..

786
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:05,272
You might feel different.

787
00:41:05,482 --> 00:41:11,362
You might even be able to fool
people, for a little while..

788
00:41:15,816 --> 00:41:18,782
But can you ever actually change..

789
00:41:18,783 --> 00:41:21,723
Who you really are?

790
