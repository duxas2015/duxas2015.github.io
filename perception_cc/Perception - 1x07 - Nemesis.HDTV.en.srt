On the contrary, he's talking a great deal.

You.. You can't be sure.

357
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:28,326
He's the one who told us
where the knife was hidden.

358

Brady: I stabbed her, over and over,

359

Of course he confessed.
It's called imagination inflation.

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,087
You tell a schizophrenic the same story
enough times and he starts to believe it.

Those agents told him over and over
again that they know he did it.

Daniel, it was a by-the-book interrogation,
Brady was offered food, water.

He was never yelled at or threatened.

365
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,501
He should have had an attorney present.

They mirandized him twice.
He denied representation.

367

Well, of course, because he said,
"the only law is the law of Ellebra".

The court will appoint a
lawyer at arraignment.

I'm sure the issue of Brady's
competence will be raised.

That's great. An overworked,
underpaid public defender,

the case file before pleading Brady out.

Do you ever think you're
having a hallucination..

522
00:24:17,786 --> 00:24:23,217
Brady, you said you took the sword
with you to the Judge's house.

What are you getting at?

533
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,583
Brady remembers pulling the
knife out of the Judge's chest

534
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:54,819
and trying to save her
from his own perspective,

535
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,587
because that's what he actually did.

536
00:24:56,588 --> 00:24:58,993
But he can only remember the murder itself

537

539

It's imagination inflation.

The agents interrogating Brady told him
he stabbed the Judge with a knife,

542
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:16,917

forms, but he didn't really do it.

him to go there, but..

687
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,763
I didn't know anybody
was gonna get whacked.

688
00:32:17,764 --> 00:32:19,877
I swear.

689
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:23,357
He just told me to call this crazy nut,

talk about all this weird
stuff like swords and aliens,

691
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,432
and get him to the house.

692
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:31,983
That's it.

693
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:35,042
Who told you to call Brady?

[ Sighs ]

695
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:38,569
Bobby Lonergan.

696
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:44,145
I don't know who that is.

697
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:47,880
What's going on here, Agent Moretti?

698
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:49,438
Meet Bobby Lonergan.

699
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:51,823
You're new to Chicago, so
you may not know this,

700
00:32:51,824 --> 00:32:55,196
but he's one of the top guys
in the O'Bannion organization.

701
00:32:55,197 --> 00:32:58,901
Remember when I asked for your
permission to pursue other suspects?

702
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:02,759
I told you that the Irish Mob had a
contract out on the Judge last year.

703
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,012
I also remember denying your request.

704
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:08,252
Oh, okay. Uh, I can cut him
loose, but just so you know,

705
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:12,432
I've got a witness who says that
Lonergan here set up the Judge's murder.

706
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,748
Bobby: I had nothing to do
with Judge Trent's death.

707
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:17,168
- That's not what Pete Dolan says.
- Pete Dolan's a thug

708
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:19,796
who'll tell tall tales on
anyone who buys him a drink.

709
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:22,254
He seemed pretty sober when he gave you up.

710
00:33:22,255 --> 00:33:24,710
Really? Well, his sainted Mother's
prayers have been answered.

711
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,249
I'll call her when I get home.

712
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,938
You're not going home.

713
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,382
And the only person you
should call is a lawyer.

714
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,009
I already told you I don't need one.

715
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,646
I have done nothing wrong.
I am a legitimate businessman.

716
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:39,053
Right. If by business, you mean
running an organized crime syndicate.

[ Laughs ]

718
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,093
The Judge put away four of
your cronies on Rico charges.

719
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:44,675
You found out she had a stalker,

720
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:48,033
so you thought you'd use him as a
patsy to get a little payback.

721

Any criminal affiliations I
may have had in the past..

722
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:54,823
They were merely youthful indiscretions.

723

I'm a real-estate investor now.

724
00:34:01,361 --> 00:34:03,407
Wait here a moment, Mr. Lonergan.

725
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,328
Sure.

- We've got the right guy.
- But the wrong motive.

00:34:17,484 --> 00:34:19,676
Kate: Thank you for coming in Mr. Trent.

729
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:22,011
Mind telling me, what I'm doing here?

730
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:24,712
We just wanted you to know
that we've apprehended the man

731
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:28,550
responsible for your wife's murder.

732
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:31,993
You didn't need to drag me all the
way downtown to tell me that.

733
00:34:31,994 --> 00:34:35,157
I was informed the minute that
Brady McGraw was in custody.

734
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:37,026
Daniel: Brady's innocent.

Kate: We didn't mean to
upset you, Mr. Trent.

We just wanted you to know
that it was Bobby Lonergan

739
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:49,657
who arranged for your wife's death.

740
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:50,510
Who?

741
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:54,092
He's the Principal owner
of Kenmare Equity Group.

742
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:57,122
According to your S. E.C. Filings,

743
00:34:57,123 --> 00:35:01,438
Kenmare took a $2 million dollar stake
in your real-estate company last year.

744
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:03,016
Yes, that's right.

745
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,717
But I never dealt directly with this, uh..

746
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:07,522
Lonergan, you say his name was?

747
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:12,174
Yeah, but, you see, real estate isn't the
only business that Mr. Lonergan is in.

748
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:14,477
He's also a shot-caller for the Irish Mob,

749
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:17,428
the same organization that
threatened your wife last year.

750
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,129
They killed her?

751
00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:26,141
I'm sorry I blamed you.

752
00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:28,532
I understand why you did.

753
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:31,804
You filed for bankruptcy last year correct?

754
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:33,112
Yes, but I don't.. I don't see what..

755
00:35:33,113 --> 00:35:34,463
And then you withdrew the petition

756
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:38,377
after Mr. Lonergan gave you the $2 mil.

757
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:40,758
I needed a capital infusion, and I got one.

758
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:43,357
Sure, of course, but the week
after he made the investment,

759
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,930
Mr. Lonergan bought up a
bunch of the worthless land

760
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:48,430
around the old Cabrini-Green
housing project.

761
00:35:48,431 --> 00:35:50,978
I don't know what any of this
has to do with my wife's death.

762
00:35:50,979 --> 00:35:52,781
Right after Lonergan bought that land,

763
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:56,847
your wife made a ruling that approved the
rezoning of that land for commercial use.

764
00:35:56,848 --> 00:35:58,826
Lonergan made millions overnight.

765

- So he got lucky.
- With a little help from you.

What are you talking about?

767
00:36:03,418 --> 00:36:05,259
You tipped him off about
your wife's ruling.

768
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,088
That $2 million wasn't an
investment, it was a kickback.

769
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:09,363
That's ridiculous.

770
00:36:09,364 --> 00:36:11,642
We have Mr. Lonergan in custody.

771
00:36:11,643 --> 00:36:13,729
Murder for hire is a death-penalty offense.

Now, one of you's gonna
turn state's evidence.

773

The other's gonna get the needle.

774
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:21,166
Just depends on who talks first.

[ Sighs ]

776
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:39,067
One night, after a few glasses of wine,

777
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:41,878
Karen told me about a ruling she was making

778
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:44,338
in the Cabrini-Green rezoning appeal.

779
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,199
Hmm.

780
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:49,528
And the next morning, she
realized she had been

781
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:52,409
indiscreet, and she asked
me not to tell anyone.

782
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,936
But your business was in trouble,

783
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:55,911
and here was an opportunity
to make a little money.

784
00:36:55,912 --> 00:37:01,812
I had a dozen employees who were gonna
lose their job if I went under.

785
00:37:03,714 --> 00:37:06,280
So I sold the information to Lonergan.

786
00:37:06,281 --> 00:37:08,166
I didn't see the harm it would do.

787
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:10,869
But then your wife was tapped
for Solicitor General.

788
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,331
And if I can find the money
trail between you and Lonergan,

789
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:15,890
it certainly would have come up
during the background investigation

790
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:17,338
for your wife's confirmation.

791
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:21,151
You go to jail, and her
career would be ruined.

792
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:23,485
Lonergan came to me.

793
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:26,666
And he said that I needed to take
care of it, so I went to Karen.

794
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,268
Turn down the nomination.

795
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:31,883
- What are you talking about?
- We got a good life here in Chicago.

00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:33,508
It's Solicitor General, David.

797
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:35,549
I've worked my whole life for this.

798
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,097
Kate: Did you tell her why you
wanted her to turn it down?

799
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:41,975
I knew she could never live..

800
00:37:41,976 --> 00:37:43,980
With the dishonesty.

801
00:37:43,981 --> 00:37:46,686
And that she would withdraw
her name from consideration

802
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:51,787
and.. And.. And..
And tell me to turn myself in.

803
00:37:52,112 --> 00:37:54,528
I didn't want her career destroyed.

804
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:56,531
So you just had her killed instead?

805
00:37:56,532 --> 00:38:00,031
No! No! I never wanted that!

806
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:02,118
I went to Lonergan.

807
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:05,506
I need more time to convince her
to turn down the nomination.

808
00:38:05,507 --> 00:38:06,773
It's too late.

809
00:38:06,774 --> 00:38:08,742
We can't risk this coming out, David.

810
00:38:08,743 --> 00:38:11,678
- I don't know what else to do.
- Just need to be creative.

811
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:14,548
- What do you mean?
- All judges make enemies.

812
00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:16,616
I'm sure your wife has
more than just a few.

813
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:21,113
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying she needs to go.

814
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:27,014
The only question is whether she
goes alone or you go with her.

815
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:33,632
So you told him about Brady McGraw.

816
00:38:33,633 --> 00:38:37,031
You knew his delusions would
make him the perfect fall guy.

817
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:40,034
I wanted you to arrest Brady.

818
00:38:40,035 --> 00:38:42,651
That way, Lonergan's plan wouldn't work,

819
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:46,780
and I'd have had more time
to change Karen's mind.

820
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:49,890
Kate: And then when that didn't happen,
you realized you needed an alibi,

821
00:38:49,891 --> 00:38:54,752
and Lonergan got his stooge to lure
Brady to the house with the calls.

822
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:55,909
It was a great plan.

823
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,443
And it worked out even better
than you could have imagined,

824
00:38:58,444 --> 00:39:03,363
when the poor guy actually
confessed to the murder.

825
00:39:03,364 --> 00:39:07,204
It was almost the perfect crime.

826
00:39:10,587 --> 00:39:11,771
Daniel: How are you doing?

827
00:39:11,772 --> 00:39:13,455
I'm a little scared.

828
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,262
To leave the hospital.

829
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:17,356
I don't know if I can make it.

830
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:19,577
You will.

831
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:20,996
Thanks.

832
00:39:20,997 --> 00:39:25,137
But you don't know what it's like.

833
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,160
Actually, I do.

834
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,130
I was diagnosed when I was 22.

835
00:39:33,428 --> 00:39:36,728
So you're on meds, too?

836
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,973
There's no one-size-fits-all treatment.

837
00:39:40,974 --> 00:39:42,788
But..

838
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:44,262
Work helps.

839
00:39:44,263 --> 00:39:45,831
