Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:04,086
Which comes first..

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,607
Yesterday or..

4
00:00:07,798 --> 00:00:09,525
Tomorrow?

5
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:11,874
Hands up for yesterday.

6
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,815
Right. And tomorrow?

7
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:16,834
Wow. Nobody?

8
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:17,978
Not one?

9
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:19,854
Morticia, explain how you arrived

10
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:22,558
at that predictable, but
unprovable, conclusion.

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,364
It's not something anybody has to prove.

12
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:27,166
It's just something you know.

13
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:28,344
Something you know?

14
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:32,168
All we know is that what we think
of as past, present, and future

15
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:37,176
is nothing more than a.. Than a story
stitched together in our Basal Ganglia.

16
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:40,579
Our entire concept of time is
a.. Is an artificial construct.

17
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,249
In that case, I don't need
to hand in my lab report.

18
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,685
Because for all you know, I already did.

19
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:49,322
That is entirely correct!

20
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:53,368
Of course, by that thinking,
I may already have flunked you.

21
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:55,361
Artificial construct or not,

22
00:00:55,362 --> 00:00:58,209
you have a curriculum review
with the Provost in 7 minutes,

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,399
and don't forget you've got
6 thesis proposals to review

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,816
before office hours at 4:00, so
if you could pick up the pace?

25
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:04,132
Okay, you're overbooking me, Lewicki.

26
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,510
The brain needs downtime to function.

27
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:07,639
Not yours. What did you
tell me when you hired me?

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,204
"Schedule equals sanity".

29
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:10,609
If you really cared about my sanity,

30
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:15,223
you'd keep the Provost
out of my curriculum.

31
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:16,464
You know what?

32
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:19,585
You're absolutely right. A
little break will do you good.

33
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:21,724
I'll be back in a minute.

34
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:23,345
And never say I don't bring you treats.

35
00:01:23,346 --> 00:01:26,158
"Extreme Kakuro". Very nice.

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,251
Agent Moretti. Hey,
how are you doing today?

37
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:30,305
I'm fine. Thank you, Max. How are you?

38
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:32,266
I'm good, I'm good, but unfortunately,

39
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:34,480
Professor Pierce is a
little busy right now.

40
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:36,546
Well, he doesn't look very busy to me.

41
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,148
If you need a consultant,
I can introduce you

42
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:40,380
to another very fine
Professor in the Department.

43
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:43,482
Thank you, Max, but it's really
Dr. Pierce that I need to talk to.

44
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:46,379
I hate to sound dramatic, but it really
could be a matter of life and death.

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,456
Whose?

46
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:48,323
Doc..

47
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:51,256
You can tell the Provost I'll
be there as soon as I can.

48
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:54,122
Okay, what if he's ad.. And
if he complains that I'm late,

49
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:58,563
tell him it's all in his Basal Ganglia.

50
00:02:00,595 --> 00:02:03,362
Remember The Date Night
Killer, summer of '86?

51
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:04,443
Vaguely.

52
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:06,397
Wait, Daniel, it was
the crime of the decade.

53
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:07,800
How can you not remember this?

54
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:11,345
Well, it's a hard to keep up with the
news when you're cramming for your MCATs.

55
00:02:11,346 --> 00:02:12,991
Okay, for five weeks in a row,

56
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:15,917
every Friday, a girl would
go missing in the afternoon

57
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:19,903
and turn up dead in a landfill on
Sunday morning, raped and beaten.

58
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:22,908
Well, the killings stopped, but
they never caught the guy who did it.

59
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,624
Why are you working on a cold case?

60
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:28,465
Because it's not cold any more.

61
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,498
These are clippings from 1986.

62
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:35,766
But Sunday before last, a body turns
up in Avondale, same M.O. as '86,

63
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:39,696
same Chloroform burns around the mouth,
but CPD didn't make the connection

64
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:44,560
until another body showed up just
this past Sunday in Lincolnwood.

65
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:46,410
But this time, they got a print.

66
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:49,942
100% match to one of the
crime scenes from back then.

67
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:52,894
So if the killer sticks to the pattern,
another girl disappears Friday night.

68
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:55,812
And turns up dead on Sunday.

69
00:02:55,813 --> 00:02:57,145
How can I help you catch him?

70
00:02:57,146 --> 00:03:01,046
Victim number 6. Lacey Penderhalt.

71
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:05,933
The killer grabbed her
Friday, July 18, 1986.

72
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:10,008
The next day, a propane stove blew
up an abandoned house in Maywood.

73
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:15,414
Firemen found Lacey in the cellar,
tied up, unconscious, but alive.

74
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:18,317
By the time she came to,
she was so traumatized,

75
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:20,953
she had some kind of a psychotic break.

76
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:24,088
The police tried to question
her, but she was incoherent.

77
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,639
Did she ever recover?

78
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,235
Well, she's been living in
a psychiatric nursing home

79
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:32,066
for the past 26 years,
apparently pretty out of it.

80
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:34,125
And you want me to see if
I can get through to her.

81
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:36,856
The Bureau's got 50 agents
working crime scenes,

82
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:39,231
chasing down leads,
tracking present-day victims.

83
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:42,362
But I think that the answer is Lacey.

84
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:44,017
Well, if I'm gonna have
any hope of reaching her,

85
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,317
I'm gonna need to know more than this.

86
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:47,810
Absolutely. I just don't think
you should hear it secondhand.

87
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,169
I think you should get this
from somebody who was there.

88
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,063
Who's that?

89
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,893
Retired Police Detective Joe Moretti..

90
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:56,293
A.K.A. my Dad.

91
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:58,378
It was a terrible summer.

92
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,857
I wouldn't let Katie
3 feet out of my sight.

93
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:03,638
I was 6, Dad. Not
exactly the target demo.

94
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,599
Talk to me when you're a parent.

95
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:11,537
Every Detective on the force was
working some angle of that case.

96
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:14,487
My squad, we were checking out the
clues from the killer's journal.

97
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,496
- Mm.
- He kept a journal?

98
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:18,498
You buried the lead, Agent Moretti.

99
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:20,555
Don't worry. I brought a copy.

100
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:22,887
They found the original
in the wrecked house.

101
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:27,505
This is where the killer
kept track of all his crushes.

102
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:29,809
"I met the most incredible
girl on the El today.

103
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,920
Lily.. Isn't that a beautiful name?"

104
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,791
Lily Pasetti. Victim number 3.

105
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,616
Sounds like he was fixated on her.

106
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:38,573
Yeah, for a week.

107
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:42,050
Every Monday and Tuesday, he'd meet
a new girl, and she'd be "the one".

108
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:44,517
On Wednesday and Thursday, he'd write
about dancing with them in a club

109
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,794
or swimming with them at the lake.

110
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:49,646
And every Sunday, it was the same
thing.. How the girl disappointed him,

111
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:52,799
how she'd broken his heart
or turned out to be a phony.

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,388
"I bought Sandra a
drink at The Blacklight".

113
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:57,637
Anybody at The Blacklight
see who bought her a drink?

114
00:04:57,638 --> 00:04:58,970
She was a hot number.

115
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:01,546
Friends said there was a ton
of guys buying her drinks.

116
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:05,559
But we couldn't put any one of those
guys at the club where Lily was dancing

117
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,347
or swimming at the lake with Suzanne.

118
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,829
But the entries about
Lacey are different.

119
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,489
"I saw Lacey today, and I thought,"

120
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,852
"wow, she's been here all
summer, everywhere I look".

121
00:05:14,853 --> 00:05:15,985
He knew her.

122
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:20,087
That's why we were always hoping
that Lacey would come around but..

123
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:22,034
She's nuttier than Grandma's fruitcake.

124
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:24,736
- Dad, mm-mm.
- Sorry, Katie.

125
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:28,037
Just a figure of speech.

126
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:29,814
What I can't figure out

127
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:34,250
is why he would take it up
again after a 26-year vacation.

128
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,358
Maybe he got scared after
you found his hideout, or..

129
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,188
Maybe he just found some other way
to scratch what was itching him.

130
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:44,263
Either way, it's time to
go talk to Lacey Penderhalt.

131
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:45,080
Thanks.

132
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:48,257
And maybe someday you'll even come
around when you don't need something.

133
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:49,593
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- Dad..

134
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:52,916
I understand, fresh in
town, new job, lots to do.

135
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,441
Hmm.

136
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:58,726
Speaking about fresh in town,
when is Donnie coming in from D.C.?

137
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:01,960
Soon. Definitely. Yeah,
soon. I.. And I'll call you.

138
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,880
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

139
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:05,980
Wait. I just remembered.

140
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:09,660
I met you parents' night,
Katie's freshman year.

141
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,710
You're the Professor
she had the big crush on

142
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,589
- the whole time she was in college.
- Nope.

143
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,510
What?

144
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,387
So, you're probably
wondering who Donnie is.

145
00:06:23,388 --> 00:06:24,788
None of my business.

146
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:26,625
Well, it's okay. I should have told you.

147
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:27,791
You don't have to tell me anything.

148
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,796
He's my husband.

149
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:31,395
You're married?

150
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:32,970
Soon-to-be divorced.

151
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:35,254
I met him in D.C. it
just did not work out.

152
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:37,590
Why are you lying to
your Father about that?

153
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:39,929
He hated Donnie the
second he laid eyes on him.

154
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,524
"He's all wrong for you, Katie".

155
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:45,031
I just couldn't give him the satisfaction
of knowing he was right, you know?

156
00:06:45,032 --> 00:06:47,048
Agent Moretti? Dr. Pierce?

157
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:49,334
- Ryan Cutler.
- Thank you for seeing us, Dr. Cutler.

158
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:51,119
Does Lacey know we're coming?

159
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,388
Lacey doesn't know much of anything.

160
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:55,724
If you're hoping for
help solving your case,

161
00:06:55,725 --> 00:07:00,825
I'm afraid you're going
to be very disappointed.

162
00:07:05,753 --> 00:07:08,033
Hi, Lacey.

163
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:13,196
My name is Dr. Pierce.

164
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:16,581
And uh, this is my friend,
Kate Moretti, with the FBI.

165
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:21,502
Is it all right if we
ask you some questions?

166
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:31,692
I'll come back a little
later, if that's all right.

167
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:36,973
I'm gonna need to see her
complete medical history.

168
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:01,120
I'm.. I'm, uh, told that
I can be a little addled,

169
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:04,592
so, uh, let me see if I understand
what it is that I've been reading.

170
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:07,625
26 years ago, after being
beaten, raped, tied up and gagged,

171
00:08:07,626 --> 00:08:11,774
Lacey Penderhalt was understandably
hysterical, agitated, and disoriented,

172
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,011
for which condition she was
administered 2 milligrams of Lonoxonol,

173
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:17,720
which, even in that
prehistoric era, was 10 times

174
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:20,530
the recommended dose of a
dangerously powerful sedative,

175
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,281
which has since been proven to trigger

176
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:25,046
psychosis in patients
with recent head injuries.

177
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:28,784
Because the drug caused Lacey to
present as psychotic, she was diagnosed

178
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:31,215
with Traumatogenic
schizo-affective disorder..

179
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:33,988
A phrase I mercifully haven't
heard spoken in 20 years..

180
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:36,591
And treated with heavy
doses of Chlorpromazine,

181
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:39,547
another genuine relic of
Psychotherapeutic antiquity,

182
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:41,769
which rendered her nearly comatose.

183
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,924
The now mentally disabled
patient was transferred to a

184
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:46,436
long-term care facility,
where the so-called Doctors

185
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:49,924
rubber-stamped the original diagnosis
like the good little employees they were.

186
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:52,661
The patients in this facility
get the very best possible care.

187
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:55,500
Right, I.E., once a
month a functionary on the

188
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,601
payroll of the nationwide
health conglomerate that

189
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:00,167
owns this chain of warehouses
for the mentally ill

190
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:03,853
glances at a chart, checks a box, and
moves on to the next patient on the shelf.

191
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:07,424
- You're going to leave now.
- Yes, I am, but I'll be back.

192
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:13,173
In the meantime, I want Lacey taken off
her meds so I can ask her some questions.

193
00:09:13,174 --> 00:09:16,372
I am not going to endanger my
patient on the strength of an opinion

194
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:21,369
offered by an ivory tower theoretician
after a 30-second examination.

195
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,224
The fact is, the decision isn't
really in your hands, is it, Doctor?

196
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:30,245
We're talking to the wrong person.

197
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:35,177
This is Lacey's room.

198
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,704
I haven't touched a
thing since the night..

199
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:44,465
She was attacked.

200
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:52,866
We all knew the killer was out there.

201
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:55,393
I never should have
let her out of my sight.

202
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,209
According to the statement
you gave back then,

203
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,102
Lacey told you she was going to a movie?

204
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:03,663
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off" she..

205
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:07,126
Kept saying, "Mom, I'm not an idiot".

206
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:10,080
"There's a million people on the street.

207
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:14,881
I'm not gonna walk down
some dark alleyway".

208
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:16,849
Dr. Pierce..

209
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,419
If I let you do what you're asking..

210
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,219
If they stop giving her the drugs..

211
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,460
Will she know me again?

212
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:30,886
Honestly, I don't know
the answer to that.

213
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:33,050
But if we try this..

214
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:38,951
We might be able to stop the killer
from hurting anybody else's daughter.

215
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:48,427
- You're just in time.
- Have you stopped her meds?

216
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:50,888
You tell me.

217
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:54,886
Who are you?!

218
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,424
Who are you?! Get away from me!

219
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:59,312
Valium, 20cc's.

220
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:05,013
Unless my esteemed colleague
can offer a better suggestion.

221
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:14,104
If you'd seen what I
did to this poor woman.

222
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:15,577
I'm sure you did what
you thought was right.

223
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:18,638
So did Joseph Stalin.

224
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:25,169
How could I have been so
wrong about something..

225
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,774
Daniel?

226
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,706
What is it?

227
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:34,804
Me..

228
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:37,685
In about 40 years.

229
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,268
That was weird one, even for me.

230
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,858
You're hallucinating.

231
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:45,592
What else is new?

232
00:11:45,593 --> 00:11:48,744
Didn't I read a book once by a
certain brilliant neurosurgeon

233
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:53,494
who speculates that sometimes, even
the most frightening hallucinations

234
00:11:53,495 --> 00:11:57,098
can be the brain's way of making
sense of things that seem random?

235
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,671
Maybe the author of that book was just
trying to make himself feel better.

236
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,369
Daniel, think.

237
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,050
What is the old you
telling the young you?

238
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:24,475
- That's it.
- Daniel, what is it?

239
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:25,950
- That's what must have happened.
- What?

240
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:28,337
Yeah, but where..

241
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:31,450
Where was I? I.. I
didn't see it in there.

242
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,592
Natalie, I.. I can't.. I
can't explain it right now.

243
00:12:34,593 --> 00:12:36,453
Doc?

244
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:40,826
Are you having an episode?

245
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:45,152
Yes, I'm having an episode.

246
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:46,586
Well, Doc, it's okay.

247
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:48,293
I need to go to the hospital right now.

248
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:51,082
You know, I.. I knew I should have
kept Agent Moretti away from you.

249
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,027
We'll have a Doctor see you right away.

250
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:55,501
I don't need to be admitted, Lewicki.

251
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:58,562
I need to see Lacey.

252
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:13,116
I knew it.

253
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,009
What the hell are you doing here?

254
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,341
Lacey didn't get upset because she was

255
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:18,179
having some kind of
psychotic hallucination.

256
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,145
She saw her own reflection in the
glass, and she didn't know who it was.

257
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:22,078
What are you talking about?

258
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,252
Have you got her back on
the Antipsychotics yet?

259
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:25,203
Not yet.

260
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:28,017
Good. Maybe she'll talk to me.

261
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:31,300
If you bother her again, you'll
be dealing with Security, not me.

262
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,693
Doctor, it's Tuesday night.

263
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:34,069
On Friday, another girl disappears.

264
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,930
Do you want that girl's
blood on your hands?

265
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:45,032
Lacey.

266
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:47,075
Lacey, I need to talk to you.

267
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,836
Can you hear me?

268
00:13:53,218 --> 00:13:57,598
- Who are you?
- My name's Dr. Pierce.

269
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,156
How did I get here?

270
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:05,490
You were the victim of a violent crime.

271
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:07,011
Where's my Mom?!

272
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,530
You'll see your Mother
very soon, I promise you.

273
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:15,431
Right now, the police need to know
the very last thing you remember.

274
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:18,879
I remember talking to my friend..

275
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,315
Cindy on the phone
last night, and then I..

276
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:22,538
And then I went to sleep.

277
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:24,378
What night was last night?

278
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:25,646
Thursday.

279
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:28,769
What happened to me? What is going on?

280
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,810
Lacey..

281
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,637
How old are you?

282
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,438
17.

283
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:38,810
Right there..

284
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:42,536
Significant accumulation of
Hemosiderin.. Old hemorrhaged blood.

285
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:43,881
Uh, meaning what?

286
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:46,855
Lacey suffered a traumatic brain
injury at the time of her abduction,

287
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:48,306
either at the hands of
her killer or because

288
00:14:48,307 --> 00:14:50,063
something fell on her head
when the house blew up.

289
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:52,426
How come nobody noticed
this back in 1986?

290
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:54,611
They didn't have this technology,
so they just drugged her,

291
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:57,651
assuming it was a psychiatric
problem, and they kept drugging her.

292
00:14:57,652 --> 00:15:00,452
Okay, now, how does this help us?

293
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:02,495
It gives us a diagnosis..

294
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:04,896
And a plan.

295
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:11,537
How are you feeling, Lacey?

296
00:15:11,538 --> 00:15:13,998
Who are you?

297
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:18,794
How did I get here?

298
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:22,309
Where's my Mom?

299
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,618
Lacey has a textbook case
of Anterograde Amnesia.

300
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:29,142
Which means what, exactly?

301
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:32,905
It's a rare disorder in which the
subject is unable to create new memories.

302
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:34,772
That's why she thinks she's 17, boss..

303
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:36,692
Not because she's delusional,
but because nothing

304
00:15:36,693 --> 00:15:39,453
that's happened to her for
the last 26 years has stuck.

305
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,322
She can hold onto things
for a short while..

306
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:45,326
The length of a conversation, maybe
a little longer, but then it's gone.

307
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:48,429
- Does she remember who attacked her?
- No. Everything stops at Thursday night.

308
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,239
Well, what good is a witness who can't
remember someone she met an hour ago,

309
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,369
much less the man who attacked
her and kidnapped her in 1986?

310
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,778
Actually, we have every reason to
believe that because of her condition..

311
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,207
She does remember him.

312
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,741
How do you figure that?

313
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,231
According to the journal, the killer
is someone that Lacey interacted

314
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:06,214
with several times in the days
leading up to her abduction.

315
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,691
Everything that
happened to her that week

316
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:10,851
is as fresh in her mind a..
As this morning is for us.

317
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:12,624
If the physical injury
caused the amnesia,

318
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,044
then why wouldn't she remember everything
up to the moment she got clobbered?

319
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,800
Because her memory
wasn't cut like a ribbon.

320
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:20,012
It was.. It was smashed, like glass.

321
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:22,975
Lacey's Mother has kept her
bedroom like a time capsule.

322
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:24,870
Nothing has changed
since the day she left.

323
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:26,976
Now, if we bring her
home when she's sedated,

324
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:28,888
let her wake up where she expects to,

325
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:32,787
and for her, it'll be a
Friday morning in 1986.

326
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:36,384
We'll be able to ask her about
everything that she saw that week.

327
00:16:36,385 --> 00:16:39,645
We know what to ask. We got the journal.

328
00:16:39,646 --> 00:16:41,514
Not exactly orthodox.

329
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:45,653
All due respect, Sir, "orthodox"
hasn't exactly caught this killer.

330
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:48,656
Look, the Mother's got
to be what, like 65?

331
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:51,760
How are you gonna explain
her aging 26 years overnight?

332
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,395
Probert, I do know that women
are a complete mystery to you,

333
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:57,865
but have you ever heard of a
little something called a makeover?

334
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:00,226
You look wonderful, Mrs. Penderhalt.

335
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,868
You took care of the cordless
phones, everything else?

336
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,529
It's all in the garage.

337
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,645
S.. She looked so peaceful last
night, asleep in her own bed.

338
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:13,380
I'm just terrified of what's
going to happen when she wakes up.

339
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:15,575
She'll be at home, in her own room.

340
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,435
And you'll just introduce
her to some people

341
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,317
who want to ask her a couple questions.

342
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:21,244
Well, what happens when you are gone?

343
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:24,191
I mean, say we walk into the
kitchen and we're talking,

344
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:26,894
and suddenly she can't remember
what we're talking about

345
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,375
or how she even got in there?

346
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:29,897
So tell her a half-truth.

347
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:33,468
She got a bump on the head, and that's
why she's been a little forgetful.

348
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,987
The Doctor says she needs to stay home
and rest, and she'll be fine tomorrow.

349
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:41,309
And then that tomorrow never comes.

350
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,318
She's at home with someone who loves her

351
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:47,699
and not with strangers in some hospital.

352
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,577
What happens when she
looks at her own hands?

353
00:17:55,578 --> 00:17:58,718
For 26 years, she hasn't
washed a dish or chipped a nail.

354
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:02,979
I.. I wish my hands looked like hers.

355
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:11,681
Mom!

356
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:15,849
Could you, like, knock?

357
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,342
What's going on?

358
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:28,974
Lacey, I'm sure you've been hearing on
the news about The Date Night Killer.

359
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,545
Oh, my God. Did another girl get killed?

360
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,545
Please tell me it's not somebody I know.

361
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,982
No. No, angel. Everybody's fine.

362
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,342
Mom..

363
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:39,979
Oh, I'm sorry.

364
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,058
I'm just so.. I'm just so
happy to have you home, honey.

365
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,335
Where else would I be?

366
00:18:46,336 --> 00:18:48,316
Right.

367
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:50,640
Are you feeling all right?
You don't look so hot.

368
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,460
No, I'm fine. I just..
I didn't sleep very well.

369
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:55,936
Mrs. Penderhalt, can I trouble
you for a cup of coffee?

370
00:18:55,937 --> 00:19:00,857
No trouble at all. I'll
be right back, honey.

371
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,011
Oh, I love them.

372
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,812
Oh.

373
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:12,211
Great minds.

374
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,813
Lacey, the police found a journal that
the killer has been keeping all summer

375
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:21,236
of the girls who he's kidnapped and uh..

376
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:25,898
I'm afraid that the most recent
entries have been about you.

377
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,933
Are you saying he wants to kill me?

378
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:28,965
That's why we're here.

379
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:32,628
We need to ask you some questions about
who you've been talking to this week,

380
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:36,777
because we believe that one of
those people could be the killer.

381
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:40,105
On Monday, he wrote in his journal..

382
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:43,283
"Had a blast watching
Lacey play softball".

383
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:47,653
Do you remember anyone
watching you play softball?

384
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:49,454
No.

385
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:51,869
Unless..

386
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,659
Unless?

387
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,016
Coach Parker.

388
00:19:56,017 --> 00:19:59,702
But it couldn't be him. I mean,
he's, like, the greatest guy ever.

389
00:19:59,703 --> 00:20:01,094
Except?

390
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:03,286
Sometimes, I think there's..

391
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,944
Something a little skeezy about
the way he looks at Cheryl James.

392
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:10,226
Do you think it could be coach Parker?

393
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:14,079
Uh, we don't know, but we
will certainly check it out.

394
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,739
Someone complained about
inappropriate behavior 26 years ago?

395
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,725
Not a complaint, just a report.

396
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:24,466
About an under aged
girl named Cheryl James.

397
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:35,044
Cheryl James Parker,
my wife of 22 years.

398
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:39,013
On Tuesday, he writes,
"saw Lacey at the pool".

399
00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:40,937
You were at the pool on Tuesday?

400
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:43,749
Yeah. It's free on
Tuesdays. I.. I always go.

401
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,930
Anybody flirt with you?

402
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,007
There's this hot
lifeguard.. Rick Matthews.

403
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:51,357
Oh.

404
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:53,143
He's always flirting.

405
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:54,796
I have a picture of.. Of him.

406
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,657
Hmm.

407
00:20:59,414 --> 00:21:01,233
Mom!

408
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:04,218
What happened to my mirror?

409
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,833
It broke during the night. I
cleaned it up while you were asleep.

410
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:12,214
The pictures are all in the top drawer.

411
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:18,613
That's me and Cindy and Rick.

412
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:19,931
Hmm.

413
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:23,530
He says he's gonna go to
L.A. to become a rock star.

414
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:27,431
Yeah. I remember Lacey Penderhalt.

415
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:30,122
And where were you
the last two weekends?

416
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,481
Playing the upper peninsula.

417
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:34,409
We're the hottest Motley
Crue tribute band..

418
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,230
West of Cleveland.

419
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:41,166
Thursday, "I saw Lacey at work
yesterday. She's so distracting!"

420
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:44,637
"But there's nobody I'd
rather be distracted by".

421
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,558
Work?

422
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,480
Oh, that could be Eddie Russell.

423
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:52,922
He's a junior partner at the law office

424
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:56,068
where I do filings on
Monday and Wednesday.

425
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:57,285
Did he talk to you?

426
00:21:57,286 --> 00:21:58,773
Oh, he's always talking to me.

427
00:21:58,774 --> 00:22:01,654
And every time he does, I feel
like I need to take a bath.

428
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:03,515
Hmm.

429
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:07,784
Apparently, he had too many eggnog
at the office Christmas party,

430
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:12,520
and he was chasing his assistant down
the fire stairs when he lost his balance.

431
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:15,481
Been in a bed for six years now.

432
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:19,137
Seems there is justice
in the universe after all.

433
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:23,338
Well, thank you. I'm very sorry to..

434
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,545
Excuse me. I need to take this.

435
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:28,546
- Mm-hmm.
- Moretti.

436
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:31,685
- Then you're off the case?
- Mm.

437
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:33,402
Just off Lacey.

438
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:35,637
He wants me running down
leads with everybody else.

439
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:36,950
Then what are you doing in a bar?

440
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:39,365
They've already checked and
double-checked those leads.

441
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:42,868
And I did not graduate third in my class
from Quantico to be a triple-checker.

442
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:45,951
Will you leave those alone?
They're older than you are.

443
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:49,044
So, what, you want me to go down there
and tell your boss he's wasting talent?

444
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:50,376
No.

445
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:52,525
What I want to know is
if there's anything else

446
00:22:52,526 --> 00:22:55,347
you can remember from
'86 that might help us.

447
00:22:55,348 --> 00:22:57,971
Babe, I've done the full download.

448
00:22:57,972 --> 00:23:00,459
But I do have a question.

449
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,768
You always tell your old man the truth?

450
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:05,412
I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

451
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:06,992
Well, just think about it.

452
00:23:06,993 --> 00:23:09,171
In her own head, Lacey is 17.

453
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:13,896
She tells her Mother she's going to
the movie, alone, on a Friday night.

454
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:15,697
So?

455
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:19,405
Come on, Katie. You think I
forgot that certain night in 1997

456
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:22,183
when a certain
17-year-old told her Dad

457
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:24,831
that she was going to
the mall with Marsha Ford?

458
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:27,940
Her Dad bumps into her on Navy Pier

459
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:30,310
in the company of a bum
with a ring in his nose.

460
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:31,789
He was not a bum.

461
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,162
He was a philosophy
major at Northwestern.

462
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:41,063
The point is, daughters don't
always tell their parents the truth.

463
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:50,579
Is he here?

464
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,338
You really should call first.

465
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:54,377
Yes. Next time, I promise.

466
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:57,827
Look, what you're doing
is not good for him.

467
00:23:57,828 --> 00:24:00,814
What are you talking
about? Like, his condition?

468
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,870
Because I know about his condition.

469
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:04,069
Is he having some sort of a..

470
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,228
No, no, no. He's fine.
But he's agitated.

471
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:09,068
Okay? He missed office
hours. He hasn't gotten

472
00:24:09,069 --> 00:24:11,707
any work done. He's
obsessing on the case.

473
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,286
If you keep disrupting his routine,
who knows what could happen?

474
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,761
Listen, I'm sorry, but I wouldn't be
here if it weren't extremely urgent

475
00:24:17,762 --> 00:24:20,912
that I bring him to
Lacey's house right now.

476
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:24,873
What are you two whispering about?

477
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:28,258
Lacey..

478
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:33,441
Honey, this is Dr. Pierce
and Agent Moretti of the FBI.

479
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:35,160
The FBI?

480
00:24:35,161 --> 00:24:36,660
Why? What's going on?

481
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:40,320
Uh, Lacey, I'm sure you've heard about
The Date Night Killer on the news.

482
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:41,608
Oh, my God.

483
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:44,051
Did somebody I know get killed?

484
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:49,704
No, but we have reason to believe
that the killer is somebody you know.

485
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,625
What?

486
00:24:52,152 --> 00:24:54,547
Mrs. Penderhalt, can I trouble
you for a cup of coffee?

487
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:59,888
It's no trouble at all.
Honey, I'll be right back.

488
00:25:01,024 --> 00:25:03,364
Lacey, um..

489
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:06,505
We know that you told your Mother

490
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:09,639
that you were gonna be going
to the movies tonight, alone.

491
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,383
"Ferris Bueller".

492
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,683
- We know you're not telling us the truth.
- Yeah.

493
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:17,444
Why would I lie?

494
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:22,622
Lacey, I was 17 myself once.

495
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:27,447
And I know how grown-ups can freak
out and overreact about nothing.

496
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:30,651
I mean, my Dad once
grounded me for just saying

497
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:34,658
that I thought Keith Richards
looked cool with a cigarette.

498
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,212
So I know why you might feel like,

499
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:40,682
you have to make things up sometimes.

500
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:42,738
But please..

501
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:46,205
Think about all those
girls who were killed.

502
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:49,988
Think about the girls
who still might die.

503
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:53,469
You can help us save them.

504
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:57,583
I was going to go meet a guy.

505
00:25:57,584 --> 00:26:00,886
I didn't tell my Mom
because she would kill me.

506
00:26:00,887 --> 00:26:02,122
Uh-huh.

507
00:26:02,123 --> 00:26:03,873
He's 24.

508
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:05,161
Who is he?

509
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:06,750
He's a photographer.

510
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:11,397
He saw me in the Park and asked
to take my picture, and I said yes.

511
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:13,920
That's all he did.. Take your picture?

512
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:16,441
He kissed me.

513
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:21,816
But he never asked me to take off my
clothes or anything like that, I swear.

514
00:26:21,817 --> 00:26:23,340
Mm-hmm.

515
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:26,101
What's his name?

516
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:29,224
Kenny Strand.

517
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,112
Relax!

518
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:35,599
Come on. Have fun.

519
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,789
We're selling perfume here, not
remaking "Night of The Living Dead".

520
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,990
- Kenny?
- Can't you see that I'm..

521
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,854
Sorry. I thought you
were my idiot assistant.

522
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,284
What can I do for you?

523
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:49,995
Are you the Kenny Strand
who took pictures of girls

524
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:52,692
in Oak Park in the summer of 1986?

525
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:58,393
That's me, in the long-gone
days before I sold my soul.

526
00:26:58,546 --> 00:27:00,957
Ever done any modeling?

527
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:02,880
Actually, I'm in a
different line of work.

528
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:06,936
And I have some questions to ask you.

529
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:10,606
I always wondered
what happened to Lacey.

530
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:13,263
One night, she didn't
show up for the shoot.

531
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,676
Never heard from her again.

532
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:16,946
Hmm. But you did take her picture?

533
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:20,667
She's all over my first book.

534
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:31,447
When you made out with her, were
you aware that she was under 18?

535
00:27:32,655 --> 00:27:35,832
Uh, it was an innocent kiss.

536
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:38,009
I was uh..

537
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,037
Getting her more comfortable,

538
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:42,979
getting her to loosen up
in front of the camera.

539
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,295
Yeah, I'm sure you wanted all the
girls you photographed loosened up.

540
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:49,711
It was nothing like that.
Look at the pictures.

541
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:53,700
I was celebrating their
youth, their innocence.

542
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:54,735
What do you think?

543
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:58,857
I'm not seeing anything
fetishized or eroticized here.

544
00:27:58,858 --> 00:28:01,138
Excuse me.

545
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:04,461
Moretti. Cut Ansel Adams loose.

546
00:28:04,462 --> 00:28:05,653
What are you talking about?

547
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:08,264
Another woman was just
abducted in Bedford Park.

548
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:12,946
So much for your nut job expert
and your brain-damaged witness.

549
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:15,538
Guy said his girlfriend left
the club around 9:20 for a smoke.

550
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,978
Half-hour later, he goes
looking. Girlfriend's gone.

551
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:20,834
Bouncer says around 9:25, he saw a guy

552
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:23,564
around 50, white, medium
height, practically

553
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:26,723
carry some drunk-off-her-ass
girl to his car.

554
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:28,117
Chloroform.

555
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:29,610
Bouncer asks the guy if he needs a hand.

556
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:33,022
Guy says he's glad his little girl
has the sense to call her Daddy

557
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:35,324
when she's too drunk
to drive herself home.

558
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:38,985
Girl's name is Melinda Davis.

559
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,851
If we don't find her
in the next 24 hours,

560
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,646
we're definitely gonna
find her on Sunday morning.

561
00:28:42,647 --> 00:28:45,227
What the hell?

562
00:28:46,043 --> 00:28:49,103
Daniel, what's wrong?

563
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:55,143
Nothing.

564
00:28:55,315 --> 00:28:59,162
Boss wants us to canvass the area
for witnesses and check Security cams

565
00:28:59,163 --> 00:29:04,598
within a five-mile radius for
medium-sized, maybe blue, maybe Honda's.

566
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:06,794
All right. Well, I need to
find someone to bring you home.

567
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:09,807
Otherwise, Lewicki's gonna
come after me with an ax.

568
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:11,728
Yeah.

569
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:19,103
Let's take the stairs.

570
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,744
What are you doing here?

571
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:34,663
You mean besides getting run over
by imaginary, homicidal bicycles?

572
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:36,069
It's better than a real one.

573
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,497
Yeah. Hmm.

574
00:29:37,498 --> 00:29:39,191
Nice shirt.

575
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:41,412
Oh. Yeah.

576
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:45,573
Now that I've dug it out again, I
don't really want to take it off.

577
00:29:45,574 --> 00:29:47,275
That was a great night, wasn't it?

578
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:48,599
Which night?

579
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,401
The night we saw Tears
For Fears at the Vic.

580
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:52,269
We didn't go to that concert together.

581
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,072
Of course we did. We were dating
then. We went everywhere together.

582
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:56,541
Daniel, I asked you to go with me,

583
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,356
and you kept saying that
the government scanners

584
00:29:58,357 --> 00:30:00,645
in public places were
monitoring your thoughts.

585
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:02,439
I ended up going with Josh Lewis.

586
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,081
Josh Lew.. No, you.. No,
you're wrong. You're wrong.

587
00:30:05,082 --> 00:30:07,823
We went to Tears For Fears together.

588
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:10,659
Don't give me that look. I
can.. Hey, I can prove it.

589
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,120
<i>Shout, shout!</i>

590
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:16,140
<i>Let it all out!
These are the things..</i>

591
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:20,663
Here you go. Two stubs, Tears
For Fears, August 10, 1986..

592
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:22,962
26 years ago last month.

593
00:30:22,963 --> 00:30:25,013
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

594
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:26,373
<i>Come on!</i>

595
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:29,574
Daniel.. Those aren't stubs.

596
00:30:29,575 --> 00:30:31,308
They're whole tickets.

597
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:35,883
You bought them, but you
never went to the concert.

598
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:38,609
What are you talking about? W..
W.. We pushed our way to the front.

599
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,557
We almost got trampled to
death on the dance floor.

600
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:43,750
I.. I.. I got a T-shirt!

601
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:46,612
You bought that shirt
at Hegwisch Records.

602
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:48,450
What?

603
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:50,907
You told Kate that you didn't
remember The Date Night Killer

604
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:53,122
because you had your head in the books.

605
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:54,765
<i>You shouldn't have
to sell your soul.</i>

606
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:56,519
But it was in my books.

607
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,177
Yes, but that was also the
summer that you started to..

608
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:03,158
Break.

609
00:31:08,238 --> 00:31:11,958
So I imagined the whole thing?

610
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,225
I put myself in Josh Lewis' place?

611
00:31:16,226 --> 00:31:20,066
You confused desire with reality.

612
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:24,431
Just like the killer.

613
00:31:24,432 --> 00:31:27,252
What do you mean?

614
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:29,679
He wrote in his journal that he..

615
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,026
He danced with his victims, he bought them
cocktails, he swam in the lake with them.

616
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:35,668
But he never really did.

617
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:38,142
His entire connection to
these women is all in his head.

618
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:40,614
He.. He.. He's a delusional Erotomaniac!

619
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:43,366
That's why.. Why the leads in
the journal don't lead anywhere.

620
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:46,303
Yes, the women danced and
drank a.. And swam in the lake!

621
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,944
But not with the killer.

622
00:31:47,945 --> 00:31:50,779
He wrote that he saw Lacey
everywhere that summer.

623
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:56,117
But that's just because he was
following her around! Which means..

624
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:58,578
The bicycles.

625
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:01,060
Let me see that book again, the..
The one with the photographs.

626
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:02,582
I'll call you back. Look..

627
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,250
Daniel, Kenny's alibi checked out.

628
00:32:04,251 --> 00:32:05,833
He's not our killer.

629
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:08,654
Give me the book.

630
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:12,995
Yeah. Look at that.

631
00:32:12,996 --> 00:32:15,260
- That's a bicycle.
- Uh-huh.

632
00:32:15,261 --> 00:32:16,376
And there.

633
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:17,756
Another bicycle.

634
00:32:17,757 --> 00:32:19,277
Did you notice all this before?

635
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:20,416
I.. Yes.

636
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:24,064
I didn't notice that I
was noticing until later.

637
00:32:24,065 --> 00:32:25,994
Look at that. Fireworks. Everybody's
looking up at the fireworks,

638
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:27,531
everyone in the whole Park.

639
00:32:27,532 --> 00:32:28,817
Look at this one guy on the bike.

640
00:32:28,818 --> 00:32:32,658
- Right.
- Who's he looking at?

641
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:35,852
That's me and..

642
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,626
That's Cindy and that's Aileen.

643
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:38,928
Mm-hmm.

644
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:43,669
Do you recognize this
guy here on the bike?

645
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:46,401
No.

646
00:32:48,414 --> 00:32:51,157
But I know where he works.

647
00:32:51,158 --> 00:32:53,371
See that "M" on his shoulder bag?

648
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,538
- Uh-huh. - That's
for Mercury Messengers.

649
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:58,494
At the law office where I work,

650
00:32:58,495 --> 00:33:01,935
the bike boys are always coming
in and out, picking stuff up.

651
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:05,138
Thank you, Lacey. You may have
just helped us catch a killer.

652
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:09,805
There were 33 messengers
working for Mercury in 1986.

653
00:33:09,806 --> 00:33:11,819
But three are dead.

654
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,563
Two living out of the
country, seven nonwhite,

655
00:33:14,564 --> 00:33:18,026
four untraceable, and a
whole bunch of solid alibis.

656
00:33:18,027 --> 00:33:20,354
Leaving eight possibilities.

657
00:33:20,355 --> 00:33:22,604
We like number 29, Simon Kaydee.

658
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:25,731
He's the right age in '86. He
drives a dark-blue Nissan Altima.

659
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:28,811
The subject of several
reports of domestic violence.

660
00:33:28,812 --> 00:33:29,979
He lives in Stickney.

661
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,715
It's practically
farmland out there. It's a

662
00:33:31,716 --> 00:33:34,142
good place to tie up a
girl in your basement.

663
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:37,478
And get this.. Just last night,
he swiped his credit card at a mall

664
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:40,622
just two miles from the club
where the girl was nabbed.

665
00:33:40,623 --> 00:33:44,523
All right. Let's move on Kaydee.

666
00:33:46,964 --> 00:33:48,931
Whoa, where do you think you're going?

667
00:33:48,932 --> 00:33:50,861
- With you.
- Like hell you are. Stay here.

668
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,822
I'll call you as soon as I can.

669
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,232
Come on, Doc.

670
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:12,374
You're smarter than these jokers.

671
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,715
You know I'm not the guy.

672
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:19,595
You saw my blushing bride and the date
of the wedding, too.. Six weeks ago.

673
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:21,003
What's your point?

674
00:34:21,004 --> 00:34:24,377
If a guy's got a pretty little
filet mignon like that at home.

675
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:30,278
Why would he want to go out and slaughter
himself a hamburger every Saturday night?

676
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:36,937
Look harder, Doc. It's all right there.

677
00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:40,478
Everything you need to know.

678
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:04,040
Call Agent Moretti!
I need to talk to her!

679
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,607
Daniel, slow down. I can't hear you.

680
00:35:05,608 --> 00:35:06,623
I'm saying you need to
forget about number 29.

681
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,267
Number 17 I.. Is your man..

682
00:35:08,268 --> 00:35:11,035
Keith Trevoy of Berwyn.

683
00:35:11,036 --> 00:35:12,100
How do you know?

684
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:15,121
The question we couldn't answer..
Why did he start killing again?

685
00:35:15,122 --> 00:35:17,343
I.. It's all about the
itch he needed to scratch.

686
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:19,379
W.. W.. What was he
looking for? The one.

687
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,500
The.. The girl he could
love who would love him back.

688
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:25,697
Number 17.. He got married
September 27, 1986..

689
00:35:25,698 --> 00:35:27,260
8 weeks after the killings stopped.

690
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:30,542
B.. But his wife died four weeks
ago.. Just before the recent murders.

691
00:35:30,543 --> 00:35:32,559
Y.. You've got to get to Berwyn!

692
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,228
We have orders to show up in Stickney.

693
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:36,040
There are three dozen agents
on their way to Stickney.

694
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:39,341
They can spare a couple.

695
00:35:50,134 --> 00:35:54,285
I know how much you love Pinot Noir.

696
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:57,379
It's so wonderful that..

697
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,172
We like the same things, isn't it?

698
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:03,113
Call for backup.

699
00:36:03,114 --> 00:36:06,354
No more screaming, okay?

700
00:36:09,062 --> 00:36:11,222
Help me!

701
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:13,286
We're going in. I'll cover the front.

702
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:15,207
Yeah.

703
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,490
Aah!

704
00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:57,398
Put down the knife. It's over, Keith.

705
00:36:57,399 --> 00:37:00,000
CPD and the FBI have
this place surrounded.

706
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,855
Then I might as well kill her.

707
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,454
- No!
- You don't want to do that.

708
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:04,868
She's the one.

709
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:07,023
She's not gonna let you
down like the others.

710
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,420
How do you know that?

711
00:37:08,421 --> 00:37:11,108
We read her diary. We
found it in her house.

712
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:13,912
She said that she loves you.

713
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:19,813
She didn't realize it at first, but now she
knows that you're what she's always wanted.

714
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:23,179
Go on, Melinda. Tell him.

715
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,360
Tell him how you feel.

716
00:37:28,235 --> 00:37:30,575
It's true.

717
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,579
I love you.. More than
anyone I've ever met.

718
00:37:36,273 --> 00:37:39,873
Then why didn't you say so?

719
00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:42,446
Because..

720
00:37:42,447 --> 00:37:45,027
You scared me.

721
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:48,703
But I love you.

722
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:51,219
Liar!

723
00:38:05,328 --> 00:38:08,148
My kid, the hero!

724
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:17,795
What? I can't brag about
my daughter in my own bar?!

725
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,726
It's not like I didn't have help.

726
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:22,490
Ah, but you knew where
to go for help, which is..

727
00:38:22,491 --> 00:38:25,671
The whole key to life.

728
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:28,697
Come on, Katie. What? What?
You should be celebrating.

729
00:38:28,698 --> 00:38:32,718
Pour us a couple of scotches, Dad.

730
00:38:33,397 --> 00:38:35,737
What's up?

731
00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:39,495
Remember what you, uh, were saying about

732
00:38:39,496 --> 00:38:43,696
kids sometimes lying to their parents?

733
00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:47,366
I got something to tell you.

734
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,140
It's about Donnie.

735
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:52,481
I knew it.

736
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:00,971
Hey, Lacey, honey.

737
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:05,212
I'd like you to meet a friend of
mine. This is Dr. Daniel Pierce.

738
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:08,175
Doctor? Is somebody sick?

739
00:39:08,176 --> 00:39:10,311
Oh, no. No, nothing like that.

740
00:39:10,312 --> 00:39:14,845
Um, your Mother tells me that
you like Tears For Fears, and um..

741
00:39:14,846 --> 00:39:17,672
Well, I just happen to have two
tickets to see them at the Vic

742
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:19,965
that I can't use.

743
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:21,801
Would you like them?

744
00:39:21,802 --> 00:39:24,208
Oh, my God! Are you serious?!

745
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:25,902
They're all yours.

746
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:28,484
Thank you! I love you!

747
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:31,487
Oh, thank you so much.

748
00:39:31,488 --> 00:39:32,548
Hmm.

749
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:35,504
Your daughter saved lives.
I hope you know that.

750
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:38,519
Yes, but she's never gonna know that.

751
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,926
And she's never going
to go to that concert.

752
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:42,511
No.

753
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:45,466
But every day, you can
give her those tickets.

754
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:49,695
And every day, she'll be
just as excited to get them.

755
00:39:49,696 --> 00:39:52,080
Thank you, Dr. Pierce.

756
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:57,001
Thank you for bringing
my daughter back to me.

757
00:39:58,047 --> 00:40:02,727
Anterograde Amnesia is
a terrible affliction.

758
00:40:04,303 --> 00:40:07,364
But if you'll forgive this..

759
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:10,576
Stodgy, old science Professor a moment

760
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,679
of philosophical speculation,
it's an affliction

761
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,996
that can remind us of
something very important.

762
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:19,481
All we really have is
the present moment..

763
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:20,819
He'll be finished in a minute.

764
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,502
Actually, I, uh.. I came
to talk to you, not him.

765
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:26,088
Uh, me?

766
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:29,505
Yeah, look, I just
wanted to apologize for

767
00:40:29,506 --> 00:40:33,886
bursting in the way I do all the time.

768
00:40:33,992 --> 00:40:37,147
Actually, I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

769
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,008
Why?

770
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:43,012
You see, a big part of my job
is finding puzzles hard enough

771
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:45,751
to take him out of his
own head for a while.

772
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:47,383
And..

773
00:40:47,384 --> 00:40:51,164
This week, I realized something.

774
00:40:51,874 --> 00:40:54,901
You bring him puzzles, too.

775
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:59,305
So if I were you, I would
truly savor the here and now,

776
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:03,608
that precious and
irreplaceable right-this-second

777
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:07,513
that is never to be repeated
again in all of history..

778
00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:10,786
Quiet moment, a beautiful campus,

779
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:13,715
your friends on either side of you.

780
00:41:13,716 --> 00:41:15,648
Sun streaming in through the windows.

781
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:17,532
Savor this!

782
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:20,113
While you can.

783
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:21,985
Because for the rest for the
rest of the week, you're all gonna

784
00:41:21,986 --> 00:41:25,035
be busting your asses on a twelve
page paper on time and memory.

785
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:28,164
Due at 8:30 A.M. Monday morning.
No exceptions, no excuses.

786
00:41:28,165 --> 00:41:29,360
Aw!

787
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,214
Aw, Professor Pierce!

788
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:35,195
Come on you guys this is the fun part.

789
