I APPRECIATE YOUR INITIATIVE,

223
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,886
BUT JUDGE TRENT
WAS BRUTALLY STABBED TO DEATH

224
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,118
IN HER OWN HOME.

225
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,123
IT HARDLY LOOKS LIKE
A PROFESSIONAL HIT.

226
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,585
WHAT IT DOES LOOK LIKE
IS THE WORK OF A DISTURBED MAN

227
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,564
WHOM DR. PIERCE
CLAIMED WAS NOT A THREAT.

228

WHY I'M GOING TO MUDDLE THROUGH
THIS INVESTIGATION

240
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,924

NO WAY A SANE PERSON
WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

WITH BRADY.

YOU'VE NEVER BEEN VIOLENT

HE HAD NO REASON TO HURT HER.

AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
THAT HE DID.

AND EXONERATING HIM

AND THE CHICAGO P.D. CAN'T?

260

KICKED OFF THE CASE.

265
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,951

REMEMBER "THE HEALER"?

267
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,351

HE CONFIDED IN HER.

IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHO SHE IS,
MAYBE SHE CAN HELP US FIND HIM.

FOR ALL WE KNOW,
SHE IS FROM THE PLANET ELLEBRA.

SO, WAIT? YOU WANT ME
TO TRACK DOWN AN ALIEN?

271
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,161
NO, IN BRADY'S MIND, JUDGE TRENT
WAS AN ALIEN, BUT SHE'S REAL.

LOCATE HIM.

00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,463
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DID?

287
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,034
THEY THINK HE STABBED
A FEDERAL JUDGE.

288
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,532
OH, THERE'S NO WAY.
BRADY'S GENTLE.

GET NEAR HIM WITH A SYRINGE

A VALIUM IN HIM.

BEEN LIKE THAT.

A FREQUENT FLYER AROUND HERE.

HAVE ANYONE ELSE.

AND I COULDN'T CONVINCE HIM

307
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,667
TO GET BACK ON HIS MEDS
OR ADMIT HIMSELF.

308
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,939

TREAT THE MENTALLY ILL.

ONE TIME BRADY
WAS BROUGHT IN BY CPD,

316
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,249
THEY PEPPER-SPRAYED HIM
FOR NO REASON.

317
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,824
ELLEN, I'M NOT A COP.
I'M A PHYSICIAN.

318

BRING BRADY IN SAFELY.

IT MAY BE POSSIBLE

LET ME TAKE THE LEAD.

MAYBE DANGEROUS.

00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,201
WITH A LITTLE HELP
FROM YOU. LUCKY.

840
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,467
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

841
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,705
YOU TIPPED HIM OFF
ABOUT YOUR WIFE'S RULING.

842
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,481
THAT $2 MILLION WASN'T AN
INVESTMENT, IT WAS A KICKBACK.

843
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,710
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

844
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,845
WE HAVE MR. LONERGAN
IN CUSTODY.

845
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,920
MURDER FOR HIRE
IS A DEATH-PENALTY OFFENSE.

846
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,319
NOW, ONE OF YOU'S GONNA
TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE.

847
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,651
THE OTHER'S
GONNA GET THE NEEDLE.

848
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,016
JUST DEPENDS
ON WHO TALKS FIRST.

849
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,696
[ SIGHS ]

850
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:49,611
ONE NIGHT,
AFTER A FEW GLASSES OF WINE,

851
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,111
KAREN TOLD ME
ABOUT A RULING SHE WAS MAKING

852
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,613
IN THE CABRINI-GREEN
REZONING APPEAL.

853
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,346
HMM.

854
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,352
AND THE NEXT MORNING,

855
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:00,554
SHE REALIZED
SHE HAD BEEN INDISCREET,

856
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,716
AND SHE ASKED ME
NOT TO TELL ANYONE.

857
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,394
BUT YOUR BUSINESS
WAS IN TROUBLE,

858
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,363
AND HERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE A LITTLE MONEY.

859
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:08,532
I HAD A DOZEN EMPLOYEES
WHO WERE GONNA LOSE THEIR JOB

860
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,030
IF I WENT UNDER.

861
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:16,468
SO I SOLD THE INFORMATION
TO LONERGAN.

862
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,142
I DIDN'T SEE
THE HARM IT WOULD DO.

863
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,039
BUT THEN YOUR WIFE WAS TAPPED
FOR SOLICITOR GENERAL.

864
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,382
AND IF I CAN FIND THE MONEY
TRAIL BETWEEN YOU AND LONERGAN,

865
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,579
IT CERTAINLY
WOULD HAVE COME UP

866
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,040
DURING THE
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION

867
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,777
FOR YOUR WIFE'S
CONFIRMATION.

868
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:30,423
YOU GO TO JAIL,
AND HER CAREER WOULD BE RUINED.

869
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:33,919
LONERGAN CAME TO ME.

870
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,592
AND HE SAID THAT
I NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF IT,

871
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:36,921
SO I WENT TO KAREN.

872
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,415
TURN DOWN THE NOMINATION.

873
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:40,427
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

874
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,259
WE GOT A GOOD LIFE
HERE IN CHICAGO.

875
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:44,004
IT'S SOLICITOR GENERAL,
DAVID.

876
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,929
I'VE WORKED MY WHOLE LIFE
FOR THIS.

877
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,904
Kate: DID YOU TELL HER WHY
YOU WANTED HER TO TURN IT DOWN?

878
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:53,944
I KNEW SHE COULD NEVER
LIVE WITH THE DISHONESTY,

879
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:56,942
AND THAT SHE WOULD WITHDRAW
HER NAME FROM CONSIDERATION

880
00:37:56,975 --> 00:38:00,145
AND -- AND -- AND -- AND
TELL ME TO TURN MYSELF IN.

881
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,824
I DIDN'T WANT
HER CAREER DESTROYED.

882
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,320
SO YOU JUST HAD HER KILLED
INSTEAD?

883
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:10,123
NO! NO!
I NEVER WANTED THAT!

884
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:11,955
I WENT TO LONERGAN.

885
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,790
I NEED MORE TIME TO CONVINCE HER
TO TURN DOWN THE NOMINATION.

886
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,127
IT'S TOO LATE.

887
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,102
WE CAN'T RISK THIS COMING OUT,
DAVID.

888
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,830
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

889
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,026
JUST NEED TO BE CREATIVE.

890
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,027
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

891
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,838
ALL JUDGES MAKE ENEMIES.

892
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,940
I'M SURE YOUR WIFE
HAS MORE THAN JUST A FEW.

893
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,342
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

894
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:30,614
I'M SAYING
SHE NEEDS TO GO.

895
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,152
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER SHE
GOES ALONE OR YOU GO WITH HER.

896
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:43,615
SO YOU TOLD HIM
ABOUT BRADY McGRAW.

897
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:47,055
YOU KNEW HIS DELUSIONS WOULD
MAKE HIM THE PERFECT FALL GUY.

898
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:49,962
I WANTED YOU
TO ARREST BRADY.

899
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,955
THAT WAY, LONERGAN'S PLAN
WOULDN'T WORK,

900
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:57,137
AND I'D HAVE HAD MORE TIME
TO CHANGE KAREN'S MIND.

901
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,298
Kate: AND THEN
WHEN THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN,

902
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,466
YOU REALIZED
YOU NEEDED AN ALIBI,

903
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,936
AND LONERGAN
GOT HIS STOOGE

904
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,583
TO LURE BRADY TO THE HOUSE
WITH THE CALLS.

905
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:06,379
IT WAS A GREAT PLAN.

906
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:09,012
AND IT WORKED OUT EVEN BETTER
THAN YOU COULD HAVE IMAGINED

907
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,417
WHEN THE POOR GUY ACTUALLY
CONFESSED TO THE MURDER.

908
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,389
IT WAS ALMOST
THE PERFECT CRIME.

909
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:22,185
Daniel:
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

910
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:23,597
I'M A LITTLE SCARED.

911
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:25,099
TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL.

912
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,370
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN MAKE IT.

913
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:28,899
YOU WILL.

914
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:31,904
THANKS.

915
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:33,807
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

916
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,237
ACTUALLY, I DO.

917
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,250
I WAS DIAGNOSED
WHEN I WAS 22.

918
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,815
SO YOU'RE ON MEDS, TOO?

919
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:51,156
THERE'S NO
ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL TREATMENT.

920
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:54,329
BUT WORK HELPS.

921
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:57,529
AND, UH, FRIENDS.

922
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:04,865
THE PERSON I CARED ABOUT MOST
WASN'T EVEN REAL.

923
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,073
BUT I STILL MISS HER.

924
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:18,083
Max: HEY, DOC.
DEAN HALEY CALLED.

925
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,646
WANTED TO KNOW HOW
THE STOMACH FLU'S TREATING YOU.

926
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:22,746
TELL HIM
I'VE MADE A FULL RECOVERY.

927
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,388
I ALREADY DID.

928
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,462
YOU'VE GOT BACK-TO-BACK MAKE-UP
CLASSES STARTING AT 10:00

929
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,463
AND A FACULTY MEETING
OVER LUNCH.

930
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,595
OH, AND I PICKED UP
YOUR PRESCRIPTION.

931
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,060
IT'S RIGHT THERE
ON THE TABLE.

932
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:36,841
GOOD FOR YOU, DOC.

933
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,698
