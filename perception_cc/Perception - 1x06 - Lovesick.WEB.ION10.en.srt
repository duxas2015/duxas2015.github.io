00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:23,125
I DON'T KNOW.

514
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:25,139
MAYBE ONE OF THOSE PILLS
THEY GIVE TO OLD MEN

515
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:27,141
TO MAKE THEM ALL
HOT AND BOTHERED.

516
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:31,282
I GUESS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
THE SAME THING TO ME.

517
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:35,175
AND THEN HE MAKES ME
WATCH ALL THIS PORN.

518
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:37,975
IT WAS GIRLS
WITH OTHER GIRLS.

519
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:41,261
AND THEN HE WANTS ME TO...

520
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,120
YOU KNOW...

521
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:47,094
WHILE I'M WATCHING THE PORN
IN FRONT OF HIM.

522
00:22:47,124 --> 00:22:50,924
HE SAID IT WOULD HELP
RE-TEACH MY BRAIN.

523
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:53,955
HE SAID IT WAS
"PART OF THE CURE."

524
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:55,173
THE CURE FOR WHAT?

525
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:58,271
THE CURE FOR BEING GAY.

526
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:07,766
THANK YOU.

527
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,770
WELL, JUSTIN'S ALIBI
CHECKS OUT.

528
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:12,773
HE WAS AT THE MERCY SHELTER
THE NIGHT CORVIS WAS KILLED.

529
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:13,935
OF COURSE
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

530
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:16,048
HE'S A SWEET KID
WHOSE PHILISTINE FATHER

531
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:17,674
CONVENIENTLY FAILS TO MENTION
THAT HE THREW HIS OWN SON

532
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:18,776
OUT OF THE HOUSE
FOR BEING GAY.

533
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:20,641
OR HOW DID HE PUT IT?

534
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,465
"HANGING
WITH THE WRONG CROWD."

535
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:24,614
HE SOUNDED PRETTY REMORSEFUL
WHEN I TALKED TO HIM

536
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:26,544
AND INCREDIBLY RELIEVED
THAT JUSTIN WAS OKAY.

537
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:27,677
YOU KNOW,
I THINK THERE'S A CHANCE

538
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:29,646
THAT THOSE TWO
COULD WORK THINGS OUT.

539
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:31,794
AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW WHAT
"TRANSFERENTIAL DOPAMINE
DEFICIENCY" IS.

540
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:34,624
IT'S CORVIS' CODE
FOR HOMOSEXUALITY.

541
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:37,454
IT'S SO SAD THAT SOMEONE COULD
BE SO ASHAMED OF WHO THEY ARE

542
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:40,445
THAT THEY'D GO TO SOME
QUACK DOCTOR TO CURE THEM.

543
00:23:40,488 --> 00:23:42,768
YOU GROW UP IN A FAMILY THAT
TELLS YOU YOUR BASIC IMPULSES
ARE MORALLY REPUGNANT?

544
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,530
YOU MIGHT TRY ANYTHING TO MAKE
YOURSELF FEEL...NORMAL.

545
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:46,672
KIDS KILL THEMSELVES
BECAUSE OF IT.

546
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,571
OKAY, BUT IS IT RELEVANT
TO WHO KILLED CORVIS?

547
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:54,541
HE CREATES A DISORDER
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

548
00:23:54,571 --> 00:23:56,681
THEN HE COMES UP WITH
A TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR IT.

549
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:58,611
AND JUSTIN WAS PRETTY ANGRY
AT CORVIS

550
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:00,474
FOR PUTTING HIM
THROUGH IT,

551
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:02,478
SO MAYBE ONE OF HIS
OTHER PATIENTS IS ANGRY, TOO.

552
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,790
WE CAN'T INTERVIEW THEM
'CAUSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY.

553
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:07,692
YOUCAN'T, BUT ICAN.

554
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:09,692
BECAUSE I'M...

555
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:11,484
THE SPECIAL MASTER.

556
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,619
HOW COULD I FORGET?

557
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:15,559
THIS IS COMPLETELY
CONFIDENTIAL.

558
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:16,702
THE ONLY WAY
I'D DIVULGE ANYTHING

559
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:18,631
IS IF IT WERE RELEVANT
TO THE DOCTOR'S MURDER.

560
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:20,494
WE'LL DO
WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP.

561
00:24:21,598 --> 00:24:23,698
HOW DID YOU FIND
DR. CORVIS?

562
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:25,498
CHURCH.

563
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:26,503
A SUPPORT GROUP.

564
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:27,814
MY PASTOR RECOMMENDED HIM.

565
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:31,465
AND WHYDID YOU GO TO HIM?

566
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:34,824
I'D BEEN STRUGGLING
WITH THESE URGES FOR YEARS.

567
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:38,512
I'D TRIED EVERYTHING ALREADY --
SUPPORT GROUPS, COUNSELING.

568
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:39,646
NOTHING HELPED.

569
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:41,785
DR. CORVIS SAID
HIS TREATMENT WAS DIFFERENT.

570
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:43,645
DIFFERENT HOW?

571
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:46,489
HE SAID THE THING I'D STRUGGLED
WITH MY ENTIRE LIFE,

572
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,759
THE THING THAT HAS GIVEN ME
SO MUCH HEARTACHE

573
00:24:48,797 --> 00:24:50,587
WASN'T MY FAULT.

574
00:24:51,593 --> 00:24:52,703
IT WASN'T A CHOICE.

575
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:54,632
HE SAID IT WAS A DISEASE.

576
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:57,835
A NEUROCHEMICAL DISORDER,
AND HE COULD TREAT IT.

577
00:24:59,636 --> 00:25:02,636
WHAT WAS
THE TREATMENT REGIMEN?

578
00:25:02,673 --> 00:25:04,643
FIRST,
HE WOULD GIVE ME A PILL.

579
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:07,635
WE ONLY GOT IT
IN HIS OFFICE.

580
00:25:07,678 --> 00:25:09,578
HE PROMISED US
IT WAS SAFE,

581
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:11,581
BUT HE SAID IT WASN'T APPROVED
FOR SALE YET OR SOMETHING.

582
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:12,653
BUT YOU TOOK IT ANYWAY?

583
00:25:12,683 --> 00:25:14,513
I WAS DESPERATE.

584
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:15,647
I WAS WILLING
TO TRY ANYTHING.

585
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:17,616
Daniel: WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER YOU TOOK THE PILL?

586
00:25:17,654 --> 00:25:19,484
I GOT THIS...

587
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,488
INCREDIBLE FEELING
OF LOVE.

588
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,591
IT GOT ME EXCITED.

589
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:24,695
I'D BECOME AROUSED.

590
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,560
AND WE MADE LOVE.

591
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:27,774
WE WOULD HAVE SEX.

592
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:29,772
IN FRONT OF HIM?

593
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:32,574
SOMETIMES HE WOULD
MAKE ME WATCH PORN.

594
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,530
OTHER TIMES HE BROUGHT IN
A SEXUAL SURROGATE.

595
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:38,708
HE FORCED YOU TO HAVE SEX
WITH NO.OMAN?

596
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:39,854
I WANTEDTO.

597
00:25:39,883 --> 00:25:41,683
AND HOW DID
THE TREATMENT WORK?

598
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:45,512
WE HAVEN'T HAD A TREATMENT
IN ALMOST SIX WEEKS.

599
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,624
WE -- WE HAVEN'T
NEEDED IT.

600
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:49,619
DR. CORVIS
SAVED OUR MARRIAGE.

601
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:51,861
HE WAS A MIRACLE WORKER.

602
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:53,715
DR. CORVIS SAVED MY LIFE.

603
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:57,594
"THE SEX
WAS MIND-BLOWING."

604
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,725
WOW, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMEINTERVIEW.

605
00:25:58,764 --> 00:26:00,564
NO,
IT'S WHAT MISTY SAID

606
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,633
ABOUT HER BEDROOM GYMNASTICS
WITH CORVIS, REMEMBER?

607
00:26:02,664 --> 00:26:03,844
HE MUST HAVE BEEN GIVING HER
THE DRUG, TOO.

608
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:05,492
WHAT, VIAGRA?

609
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:06,629
NO, VIAGRA ONLY AFFECTS
BLOOD FLOW.

610
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:08,708
CORVIS TOLD HIS PATIENTS
THAT BEING GAY

611
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:10,529
IS A NEUROCHEMICAL
DISORDER.

612
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,609
AND SINCE THE FEELING
OF BEING IN LOVE ORIGINATES

613
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,710
IN THE PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS
OF THE HYPOTHALAMUS...

614
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:16,815
[ Laughing ] OH, DANIEL,
YOU'RE SUCH A ROMANTIC.

615
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:18,721
...THE DRUG
MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING

616
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:20,539
THAT AFFECTED THE BRAIN.

617
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,549
I'M GUESSING SOME SORT OF
SELECTIVE DOPAMINE AGONIST

618
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,551
THAT PRODUCES THE SENSATION
OF BEING IN LOVE.

619
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,553
THEN CORVIS INCORPORATES
SOME COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL
TECHNIQUES...

620
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,616
SO THE PATIENT EXPERIENCES
THOSE FEELINGS

621
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:31,517
WHILE HAVING SEX
WITH A FEMALE,

622
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:32,825
AND THAT BEHAVIOR
IMPRINTS ON THEM

623
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:34,557
AND CREATES A NEW NORMAL.

624
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,703
SOMEBODY PAID ATTENTION
IN CLASS.

625
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:37,532
WAIT, SO THIS TREATMENT
ACTUALLY WORKS?

626
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,671
TEMPORARILY, MAYBE, BUT IT'S
NOT SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH

627
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:42,671
TO CREATE THE KIND OF LASTING
NEUROBIOLOGICAL CHANGES

628
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:44,884
THAT COULD ACTUALLY ALTER
A PERSON'S SEXUALITY.

629
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:46,573
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE.

630
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,775
THEORETICALLY,
BUT ETHICALLY?

631
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,539
IF THE DRUG IS STILL IN ANY
OF THE PATIENTS' SYSTEMS,

632
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:56,718
WE TEST THEIR BLOOD,
WE FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

633
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:59,553
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROBABLE
CAUSE TO GET A BLOOD ORDER.

634
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:00,693
PLUS, IT MIGHT BE
PRETTY DIFFICULT

635
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:02,622
TO GET PERMISSION
FROM THE PATIENTS.

636
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,615
IT'D BE AN ADMISSION THAT
THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL.

637
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:06,797
Woman: SILLY DANIEL,

638
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:08,832
YOU DON'T NEED
ANYONE'S PERMISSION.

639
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:10,658
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

640
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:11,838
I'M JUST SAYING IT MIGHT BE
PRETTY DIFFICULT

641
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:13,671
TO GET THE PATIENTS
TO COOPERATE.

642
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:15,531
THAT'S TRUE,

643
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:17,714
BUT YOU CAN'T REFUSE
TO COOPERATE IF YOU'RE DEAD.

644
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:18,839
[ LAUGHS]

645
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:20,668
DID THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER'S OFFICE

646
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,568
KEEP SAMPLES
OF CORVIS' BLOOD?

647
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:23,676
YEAH, OF COURSE.
WHY?

648
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:26,581
I THINK
WE'RE GONNA FIND TRACES

649
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,850
OF THE DRUG
IN HIS SYSTEM.

650
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:29,817
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO HAVE
MIND-BLOWING SEX,

651
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:30,855
JUST LIKE HIS PATIENTS.

652
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,580
I THINK
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

653
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:34,646
I THINK HE WAS TRYING
TO CURE HIMSELF.

654
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:37,691
BECAUSE CORVIS WAS GAY.

655
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:46,113
THE M.E. TESTED YOUR HUSBAND'S
BLOOD, MRS. CORVIS.

656
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:48,867
TURNS OUT
HE WAS TREATING HIMSELF

657
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:51,008
WITH A DRUG CALLED ZR-121,

658
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:54,878
WHICH CAUSES FEELINGS
OF LOVE AND AROUSAL.

659
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:57,054
NOW, THE FDA
HASN'T APPROVED IT YET

660
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,879
BECAUSE OF PERVASIVE
SIDE EFFECTS

661
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:00,228
LIKE HYPERTENSION,
PTOSIS, DRY MOUTH.

662
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,034
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

663
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:07,029
YOUR HUSBAND WAS TRYING TO
CURE HIMSELF OF BEING GAY.

664
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:09,904
HE DIDCURE HIMSELF.

665
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:13,038
JULIAN
WAS A REVOLUTIONARY.

666
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,970
HIS METHODS WERE SAVING
MARRIAGES -- SAVING LIVES.

667
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:19,044
EXCEPT BEING GAY
ISN'T A DISEASE.

668
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:20,976
CLEARLY,
THAT'S A MATTER OF OPINION.

669
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:26,009
MY HUSBAND OFFERED HOPE TO
PEOPLE WHO SHARED OUR BELIEFS.

670
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:28,979
EXCEPT HE NEVER ACTUALLY
CURED HIMSELF.

671
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:31,227
WE TRACKED
HIS CREDIT-CARD BILL

672
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:33,191
AND FOUND NUMEROUS CHARGES

673
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:37,888
TO A COMPANY CALLED C.K.L.
RESTAURANT AND LOUNGE GROUP.

674
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:41,003
SEEMS IT'S A HOLDING COMPANY
FOR A BAR IN BOYSTOWN.

675
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:43,069
WE SENT AN AGENT DOWN THERE

676
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,000
TO SEE IF ANYONE RECOGNIZED
YOUR HUSBAND.

677
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:48,074
AND TURNS OUT,
HE WAS A REGULAR.

678
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:51,065
I'M SURE HE WAS JUST OFFERING
TO HELP THOSE POOR MEN.

679
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:52,968
[ SIGHS ]

680
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:55,007
YOU WANTED YOUR HUSBAND
TO BE STRAIGHT
