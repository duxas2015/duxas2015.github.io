Ibiza, but no charges were ever filed.

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,942
Climb Kilimanjaro. Tour with my band.

345
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,897
You wanted to go to med school.

346
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:26,813
No.

347
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:28,306
That was just a fallback,
in case I didn't make

348
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:30,324
the cover Rolling Stone
by the time I was 25.

349
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:34,253
Yet for all that ambition and
such an active Limbic System,

350
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,573
none of that ever happened.

351
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:39,177
Yeah. A little thing called paranoid
schizophrenia kind of got in the way.

352
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:42,058
So you got diagnosed, and your dreams died.

353
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:44,672
No wonder you didn't recognize D.J.

354
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:49,714
You wanted to forget everything
that you'd lost when you got sick.

355
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:54,016
Gee, thank you for making me
feel like a complete failure.

356
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:57,872
- You're missing the point.
- Please, skewer me with it.

357
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:01,722
Look at what you've accomplished
in spite of your diagnosis.

358
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:04,796
Top of your class in med school,
you've written seven books,

359
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:06,798
won the Davenport Prize.

360
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,787
Compared to where you could have ended
up, you've truly climbed Kilimanjaro.

361
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:15,473
So I repressed my tragic past rather
than confront my shortcomings.

362
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:17,008
How very freudian of me.

363
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:19,672
Tell me, frau doktor, in
your hallucinatory opinion,

364
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:23,030
why am I being haunted by the
ghost of Christmas past now?

365
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:26,885
Because your unresolved issues are keeping
you from dealing with your students.

366
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:29,888
- I deal with my students every day.
- You lecture them.

367
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:32,256
But emotionally, you're totally disengaged.

368
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:35,627
- I'm a Professor, not a wet nurse.
- Now, what about Brian Cahill?

369
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:38,029
He had his future taken away
because of a brain injury.

370
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,997
You of all people should
be able to relate to that.

371
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:43,106
But, no, you just made the
diagnosis and walked away.

372
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:45,493
Hey, I saved that kid's life.

373
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:50,414
But was the life you
saved the one he wanted?

374
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:52,973
Brian: You asked to see me?

375
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:56,574
I just.. Wanted to apologize.

376
00:18:58,005 --> 00:18:59,031
What for?

377
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:01,457
I was a little perfunctory
about your diagnosis.

378
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:05,139
I.. I should have done more to help
you acclimate to your condition.

379
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,659
Have you spoken to your parents?
I.. I could call them.

380
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,514
Ah, no. It's okay.

381
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,132
I told Dean Haley that your injury
was sustained on the field,

382
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:14,732
so your scholarship won't be revoked.

383
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,286
You don't have to play to stay in school.

384
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:22,846
Um, here's a referral to a therapist who
specializes in Neurological issues.

385
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:24,391
Talking helps.

386
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:27,070
And don't worry about the paper you bought.

387
00:19:27,071 --> 00:19:29,861
We'll, uh.. We'll let that slide.

388
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:33,354
Thanks, Dr. Pierce. I really appreciate it.

389
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:35,167
Max: Hey, Doc.

390
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:37,555
- Oh. Hey, Brian.
- Hey.

391
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:40,278
- Oh, right.
- Sorry to interrupt, but, um, Kate called.

392
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,519
She's back from Mexico.

393
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:46,240
Karl did not kill Christina.

394
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:49,181
Witnesses place him in her dorm
room right before her death.

395
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:50,690
She was alive when I took off.

396
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,704
Yeah, but you were arguing.

397
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:55,187
I wanted her to come with
me to a party in Mexico,

398
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:58,515
but she thought a Midterm in
sociology was more important.

399
00:19:58,516 --> 00:19:59,484
So I left.

400
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,540
Yeah, and you took some
of her DNA with you.

401
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,616
We searched your apartment, and we
found smears of Christina's blood

402
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:08,202
all over your floor.

403
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:11,507
You must have tracked it in on your shoes.

404

Thank you.

407
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,958
Last week, Christina was over at
my place, and she had a nosebleed.

408
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,546
Why? Because you backhanded her?

409
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:32,248
I don't like your attitude, Agent Moretti.

410
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:34,209
My client has nothing more to say.

411
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,802
That's fine. I've got enough to hold him.

412
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,761
Yeah, just one small problem, though.

[ Chuckles ]

414
00:20:42,082 --> 00:20:43,725
Karl has an alibi.

415
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:45,596
I just got a text from my investigator.

416
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:51,497
He's bringing a witness down now who can
prove Karl had nothing to do with this.

417
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:57,301
I was heading back from the library,
and I ran into Karl outside the dorm.

418
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:59,497
- So you two know each other.
- [ Chuckles ]

419
00:20:59,498 --> 00:21:03,570
Well, he's kind of hard to miss.
He.. He drives a Ferrari.

420
00:21:03,571 --> 00:21:05,447
Okay. Did you talk to him?

421
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:09,830
He looked upset, so I asked
him if he was okay, and..

422
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:12,230
He said he just had this big
fight with his girlfriend.

423
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:15,574
Did he say anything else?

424
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:20,195
No. He just got in his car and drove off.

425
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:23,263
So now you know he didn't do it, right?

426
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:24,854
No. I'm sorry, Shannon.

427
00:21:24,855 --> 00:21:27,276
Your story does not prove
that Karl's innocent.

428
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:29,424
I mean, for all we know,
he could have looked

429
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:31,761
upset because he had
just murdered Christina.

430
00:21:31,762 --> 00:21:34,560
No way. She was still alive.

431
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:35,768
How do you know that?

432
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:39,799
I saw her yelling out the
window at him as he drove off.

433
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,660
I saw her, so Karl
couldn't have killed her.

434
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:53,807
I just don't buy it.

435
00:21:53,808 --> 00:21:56,229
Shannon pops up out of
nowhere with an alibi

436
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,032
that Karl forgot to mention in Mexico?

437
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:00,564
So, what's your theory?

438
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:04,444
The first time the lawyer mentioned a
witness was right after he got a text,

439
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:06,636
so I think he had his
investigator go out and

440
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:08,366
find somebody who was
willing to lie for money.

441
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:11,136
I mean, it's the Hesse-brandenburg M.O.

442
00:22:11,137 --> 00:22:13,647
Spread a little cash around,
make the charges go away.

443

If you've got one of your brilliant
Daniel Pierce ideas, I'm all ears.

447
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,731
Search her room. My guess..

448
00:22:27,732 --> 00:22:31,669
You're gonna find an envelope full of cash.

449
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,125
But I.. I don't have grounds for a warrant.

450
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:38,316
I mean, without one, I can't
so much as open her door.

I didn't know she was in your class.

She isn't, but, uh, she expressed
interest in taking it next term,

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,443

but I need the book for a lecture.

Oh, well, that's Shannon's desk over there.

You've obviously felt
that way for a long time.

I just.. I knew he was my destiny.

00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:00,124
So you came here to go to
school, to be near him.

485
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:04,210
Well, I was never gonna meet Karl
back home in Pittsburgh, so..

486
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:10,111
I signed up for the same classes, and I
gave him my notes a couple of times.

I tried to tell him how much I love him,

with me because he was drunk.

I told him that I would
do anything for him.

And then when Karl got
arrested, he remembered

what you'd said and told his lawyer.

501
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:58,086
The investigator said
that Karl was in trouble.

00:26:26,332 --> 00:26:28,533
From no suspects to a twofer.

513
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,736
- You just made my day.
- Good.

514
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:34,393
[ Cellphone ringing ] And because they
conspired to lie about Karl's alibi,

515
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:38,443
I've got enough to hold both of them
while I figure out who the killer is.

Moretti.

517
00:26:40,194 --> 00:26:42,615
Wait. Wait. Hey. Hold on. It's Max.

518
00:26:42,616 --> 00:26:44,504
Yeah.

519
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:46,605
Lewicki?

520
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:49,273
What?

521
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:54,424
Okay.

522
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:56,333
Bad news?

523
00:26:56,334 --> 00:27:00,469
One of my students got
injured playing football.

524
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,530
Try moving your toes.

525
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:05,552
You're lucky.

526
00:27:05,553 --> 00:27:10,171
After the craniotomy, the
paralysis disappeared.

527
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:13,760
What the hell were you thinking?
I told you I fixed your scholarship.

528
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:17,121
You didn't have to play.

529
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:23,030
- You don't understand.
- Why would you take a risk like this?

530
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:28,894
Since I was a little kid,
football's been my life.

531
00:27:28,895 --> 00:27:33,095
If I wasn't playing, I was training.

532
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:38,068
I never wanted to do..

533
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:40,589
Anything else.

534
00:27:42,302 --> 00:27:45,159
So what the hell am I..

535
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,880
If I'm not a football player?

536
00:27:56,662 --> 00:27:58,513
Kate: You told Shannon to lie.

537
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:00,308
Karl: I haven't told anybody anything.

538
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:01,834
Yeah, but you talked
to your attorney.

539
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:04,031
And everything we
discussed is privileged.

540
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:06,416
Not if it constitutes a crime.

541
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:09,046
And manipulating an obviously
disturbed young woman

542
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:11,266
into lying to Federal Agents
certainly qualifies..

543
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:14,357
It's obstruction of justice
and witness tampering.

544
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:17,899
We've answered all of your
questions, some of them twice.

You're free to leave.

548
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,140
Nice knowing you.

549
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:32,029
Not my call.

550
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,279
U.S. Attorney's office
declined to file charges.

551
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,511
- I don't believe this.
- I don't like it any more than you do.

But State's getting pressure
from the German Ambassador.

553

They're afraid it might lead
to a diplomatic incident.

554

- Daniel: What happens to Shannon?
- I had to let her go, too.

555
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:50,181
She lied to a Federal Agent.
That's a crime.

556
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:53,254
Yeah, but the A.U.S.A.
doesn't want to prosecute a lovesick girl

557
00:28:53,255 --> 00:28:55,996
for protecting a boy who may
very well be innocent himself.

558
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:58,459
Karl's not innocent.
He's just rich enough to afford immunity.

month, and I'll tell you what I told him..

D.J.: I do.

00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:41,606
- Sorry.
- No.

00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:43,553
- Oh, so sorry. I wasn't trying to..
- I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.

00:29:43,554 --> 00:29:46,060
You didn't. I.. I..
I just meant you should.

581
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:49,025
You should stop talking to me..

582
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:52,028
And you should tell Hathaway how you..

How you feel.

584
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:57,161

Doc, there you are. I was looking for you.

00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:06,494
Why? What are you so chipper about?

587
00:30:06,495 --> 00:30:10,311
Well, I got to wondering about the
whole paper-selling business.

588
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:13,799
Cahill said it was a grad student,
so I took a little initiative.

589
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,848
Oh, you're playing Junior Detective now?

590
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:18,281
I e-mailed the paper writer, and
I told him I needed a paper

591
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:22,489
analyzing Viznevsky's Neurological
Anatomy of Psychopathology.

592
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,461
That's a terrible idea.
Nobody would ever do a paper on Viznevsky.

593
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:29,578
His thinking is totally outdated.
I'm surprised the book's even in print.

594
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,047
It's not.

595
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:33,068
It's not even online.

596
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:35,847
That's the genius of it.

597
00:30:35,848 --> 00:30:39,508
You knew he'd have to go
to the library to get it.

598
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:42,908
- Lewicki, you sly dog.
- He walked right into my little trap.

599
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,692
The dude's a PHD student in English Lit.

600
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:48,993
His name's Andre Lustig.

601
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:53,307
I've been working on my PHD for six years.

602
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:57,209
I'm $70,000 in debt.
I have no idea how I'm gonna pay that back.

603
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,810
My specialization is in
Late Medieval poetry.

604
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:03,906
Give me a list of every student
you wrote a paper for,

605
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:06,085
and I'll allow you to withdraw from CLMU.

606
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:08,850
But no other school will take me.
I'll never finish my doctorate.

607
00:31:08,851 --> 00:31:12,579
Your M.A. might allow you to
get a job at a prep school.

608
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,889
Now, I want a list of those customers.

609
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:19,787
I don't remember their names.
I've had like 100 clients this semester.

610
00:31:19,788 --> 00:31:21,641
How is that possible?

611
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:23,213
I churn out a couple papers a day.

612
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,643
D.J.: Bullshit.

613
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:26,573
I was a great student
before I turned into you,

614
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:28,931
and even I couldn't write two papers a day.

615
00:31:28,932 --> 00:31:31,150
The paper you wrote for
Brian Cahill was good.

616
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:33,252
It's hard to believe you
wrote that in a day.

617
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:35,011
I don't sleep very much.

618
00:31:35,012 --> 00:31:38,513
What do you take, Andre? Cocaine? Speed?

619
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:42,495
Just a study aid. Helps keeps me
awake and my brain razor-sharp.

620
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:44,433
What kind of "study aid"?

621
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:48,767
It's just some pill some brainiac
kid in the Chem Department makes.

622
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:51,649
Our Chem Department might
not be as good as M.I.T.'s,

623
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,473
but it turns out some high-end product.

624
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:55,941
All right. Who's the dealer, Andre?

625
00:31:55,942 --> 00:31:57,556
I don't know his name.

626
00:31:57,557 --> 00:31:59,537
I do.

627
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:07,953
What's cooking, Billy?

628
00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:11,640
Wouldn't be a batch of
methamphetamine, would it?

629
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:13,353
- What's going on?
- You claimed that you ran

630
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:15,286
from me to flush some marijuana.

631
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:18,074
And then I remembered,
you're a chemistry major.

632
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:20,369
Yeah? So? What's that got
to do with anything?

633
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,826
We all know about your little sideline.

634
00:32:22,827 --> 00:32:27,139
Your magic pills are what went down the
drain in that bathroom, am I right?

635
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,546
It's just a study aid.
The pills aren't even illegal.

636
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,547
Then why'd you run?

637
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:38,918
Trust me, Billy.
You don't want to screw with me twice.

638
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:42,139
Because I stole the pills.

639
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,360
From who?

640
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,392
Professor Emmett.

641
00:32:46,393 --> 00:32:50,599
They're from an experiment
she's been working on.

642
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,176
Alison: The drug was a major breakthrough.

643
00:32:52,177 --> 00:32:55,039
The rats could run the maze
for 36 hours straight,

644
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,767
and their problem-solving
abilities skyrocketed.

645
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,266
Are you in FDA trials?

646
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:00,860
It wasn't for the open market.

647
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:02,765
My funding came from the
Defense Department.

648
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:06,650
They wanted a pill that would keep a
soldier awake and alert in combat..

649
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,049
Without a negative impact
on cognitive ability.

650
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,767
Our government trying to create
chemically enhanced super-soldiers.

651
00:33:11,768 --> 00:33:12,681
Why am I not surprised?

652
00:33:12,682 --> 00:33:14,563
- Daniel..
- Oh, it's historical fact.

653
00:33:14,564 --> 00:33:16,607
Hitler revolutionized the
production of crystal meth.

654
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:18,561
Japanese Kamikaze pilots
popped Dexedrine so

655
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:19,926
they could fly all the way to Pearl Harbor.

656
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:22,717
It's true. Stimulants have
always been a part of combat,

657
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:24,619
but the problem is that sleep deprivation

658
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,103
diminishes a soldier's ability
to make good decisions.

659
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:29,910
But your rats didn't dumb down.
The Pentagon must be thrilled.

660
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:31,778
At first, they were over the moon.

661
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:33,473
But we had to terminate the study when we

662
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:35,530
discovered the pill had
some serious side effects.

663
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:36,379
Which were..

664
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,810
After two days, about 20% of the rats

665
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:42,269
started to attack each
other and self-mutilate.

666
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,074
That's one hell of a side effect.

667
00:33:44,075 --> 00:33:45,492
And why we ended the study.

668
00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:46,808
What happened to the pills?

669
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:49,009
They were destroyed by my lab assistant.

670
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,590
Billy Mitchell.

671
00:33:52,352 --> 00:33:54,649
We're lucky the campus isn't a bloodbath.

672
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,217
Yeah, but why isn't it?

673
00:33:56,218 --> 00:33:58,586
You said on some of the
rats became violent?

674
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:03,535
We isolated the trigger.. The pill made
the rats hypersensitive to loud noises.

675
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:06,217
Auditory stimulation made them snap.

676
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:10,639
The pill would never have
worked on the battlefield.

677
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,296
Karl didn't kill Christina.

678
00:34:13,297 --> 00:34:16,297
But I know who did.

679
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,133
