1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:07,235
WHICH COMES FIRST --
YESTERDAY OR TOMORROW?

2
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:09,275
HANDS UP FOR YESTERDAY.

3
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:12,981
RIGHT. AND TOMORROW?

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,253
WOW. NOBODY?

5
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:17,123
NOT ONE?

6
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:19,251
MORTICIA,
EXPLAIN HOW YOU ARRIVED

7
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,287
AT THAT PREDICTABLE,
BUT UNPROVABLE, CONCLUSION.

8
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:24,162
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
ANYBODY HAS TO PROVE.

9
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,032
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
YOU KNOW.

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,300
Daniel:
SOMETHING YOU KNOW?

11
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:29,998
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT
WHAT WE THINK OF

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,200
AS PAST, PRESENT,
AND FUTURE

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,302
IS NOTHING MORE THAN A --
THAN A STORY

14
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:36,044
STITCHED TOGETHER
IN OUR BASAL GANGLIA.

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,010
OUR ENTIRE CONCEPT OF TIME

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,268
IS A --
IS AN ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCT.

17
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:42,077
IN THAT CASE, I DON'T NEED
TO HAND IN MY LAB REPORT.

18
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,210
BECAUSE FOR ALL YOU KNOW,
I ALREADY DID.

19
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,305
[ LAUGHTER ]

20
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:48,146
THAT IS ENTIRELY CORRECT!

21
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,322
OF COURSE, BY THAT THINKING,
I MAY ALREADY HAVE FLUNKED YOU.

22
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,221
[ LAUGHTER ]

23
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,163
Max: ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCT
OR NOT,

24
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:57,228
YOU HAVE A CURRICULUM REVIEW
WITH THE PROVOST IN 7 MINUTES,

25
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,188
AND DON'T FORGET YOU'VE GOT
6 THESIS PROPOSALS TO REVIEW

26
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:00,327
BEFORE OFFICE HOURS
AT 4:00,

27
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,031
SO IF YOU COULD
PICK UP THE PACE?

28
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,202
OKAY, YOU'RE OVERBOOKING ME,
LEWICKI.

29
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,031
THE BRAIN NEEDS DOWNTIME
TO FUNCTION.

30
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,295
NOT YOURS. WHAT DID YOU TELL ME
WHEN YOU HIRED ME?

31
00:01:06,334 --> 00:01:08,044
"SCHEDULE
EQUALS SANITY."

32
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,298
IF YOU REALLY CARED
ABOUT MY SANITY,

33
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,337
YOU'D KEEP THE PROVOST
OUT OF MY CURRICULUM.

34
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:15,311
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:18,183
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
A LITTLE BREAK WILL DO YOU GOOD.

36
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,082
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

37
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,224
AND NEVER SAY
I DON'T BRING YOU TREATS.

38
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,050
"EXTREME KAKURO."
VERY NICE.

39
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,115
AGENT MORETTI.
HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

40
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:29,215
I'M FINE. THANK YOU, MAX.
HOW ARE YOU?

41
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,417
I'M GOOD, I'M GOOD,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

42
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:34,228
PROFESSOR PIERCE
IS A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW.

43
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,402
WELL, HE DOESN'T LOOK
VERY BUSY TO ME.

44
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,229
IF YOU NEED A CONSULTANT,
I CAN INTRODUCE YOU

45
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,365
TO ANOTHER VERY FINE PROFESSOR
IN THE DEPARTMENT.

46
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,370
THANK YOU, MAX, BUT
IT'S REALLY DR. PIERCE
THAT I NEED TO TALK TO.

47
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,242
I HATE TO SOUND DRAMATIC,

48
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,211
BUT IT REALLY COULD BE
A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.

49
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,209
DOC --

50
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,342
YOU CAN TELL THE PROVOST
I'LL BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.

51
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:52,077
OKAY, WHAT IF HE'S AD--

52
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,212
AND IF HE COMPLAINS
THAT I'M LATE,

53
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,177
TELL HIM IT'S ALL
IN HIS BASAL GANGLIA.

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
Kate: REMEMBER
THE DATE NIGHT KILLER,

55
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,155
SUMMER OF '86?

56
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,360
VAGUELY.

57
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,161
WAIT, DANIEL, IT WAS
THE CRIME OF THE DECADE.

58
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:06,433
HOW CAN YOU NOT
REMEMBER THIS?

59
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,460
WELL, IT'S A HARD TO KEEP UP
WITH THE NEWS

60
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,126
WHEN YOU'RE CRAMMING
FOR YOUR MCATs.

61
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,425
OKAY, FOR FIVE WEEKS
IN A ROW,

62
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,266
EVERY FRIDAY, A GIRL WOULD
GO MISSING IN THE AFTERNOON

63
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,443
AND TURN UP DEAD IN A LANDFILL
ON SUNDAY MORNING,

64
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,271
RAPED AND BEATEN.

65
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,437
WELL,
THE KILLINGS STOPPED,

66
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,144
BUT THEY NEVER CAUGHT
THE GUY WHO DID IT.

67
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,376
WHY ARE YOU WORKING
ON A COLD CASE?

68
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,211
'CAUSE
IT'S NOT COLD ANYMORE.

69
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,375
THESE ARE CLIPPINGS
FROM 1986.

70
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:33,247
BUT SUNDAY BEFORE LAST,
A BODY TURNS UP IN AVONDALE,

71
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,457
SAME M.O. AS '86,

72
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,158
SAME CHLOROFORM BURNS
AROUND THE MOUTH,

73
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,490
BUT CPD DIDN'T MAKE
THE CONNECTION

74
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,496
UNTIL ANOTHER BODY SHOWED UP
JUST THIS PAST SUNDAY

75
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,399
IN LINCOLNWOOD.

76
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:45,301
BUT THIS TIME,
THEY GOT A PRINT.

77
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,473
100% MATCH TO ONE OF
THE CRIME SCENES FROM BACK THEN.

78
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,302
SO IF THE KILLER
STICKS TO THE PATTERN,

79
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,468
ANOTHER GIRL DISAPPEARS
FRIDAY NIGHT.

80
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,135
AND TURNS UP DEAD
ON SUNDAY.

81
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,184
HOW CAN I HELP YOU
CATCH HIM?

82
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,450
VICTIM NUMBER 6.
LACEY PENDERHALT.

83
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,490
THE KILLER GRABBED HER
FRIDAY, JULY 18, 1986.

84
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,348
THE NEXT DAY,

85
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,187
A PROPANE STOVE BLEW UP
AN ABANDONED HOUSE IN MAYWOOD.

86
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,292
FIREMEN FOUND LACEY
IN THE CELLAR,

87
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,494
TIED UP, UNCONSCIOUS,
BUT ALIVE.

88
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:17,197
BY THE TIME SHE CAME TO,
SHE WAS SO TRAUMATIZED,

89
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,531
SHE HAD SOME KIND
OF A PSYCHOTIC BREAK.

90
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,337
THE POLICE TRIED
TO QUESTION HER,

91
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,199
BUT SHE WAS INCOHERENT.

92
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,467
DID SHE EVER RECOVER?

93
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,505
WELL, SHE'S BEEN LIVING
IN A PSYCHIATRIC NURSING HOME

94
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,350
FOR THE PAST 26 YEARS,
APPARENTLY PRETTY OUT OF IT.

95
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,179
AND YOU WANT ME TO SEE
IF I CAN GET THROUGH TO HER.

96
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,483
THE BUREAU'S GOT 50 AGENTS
WORKING CRIME SCENES,

97
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:38,246
CHASING DOWN LEADS,
TRACKING PRESENT-DAY VICTIMS.

98
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:41,216
BUT I THINK
THAT THE ANSWER IS LACEY.

99
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,255
WELL, IF I'M GONNA HAVE
ANY HOPE OF REACHING HER,

100
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,331
I'M GONNA NEED TO KNOW
MOABSOLUTELY.S.

101
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,529
I JUST DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD HEAR IT SECONDHAND.

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,460
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THIS
FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS THERE.

103
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,196
WHO'S THAT?

104
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,530
RETIRED POLICE DETECTIVE
JOE MORETTI,

105
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,536
A.K.A. MY DAD.

106
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,238
IT WAS A TERRIBLE SUMMER.

107
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,571
I WOULDN'T LET KATIE
3 FEET OUT OF MY SIGHT.

108
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,477
I WAS 6, DAD.
NOT EXACTLY THE TARGET DEMO.

109
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,310
TALK TO ME
WHEN YOU'RE A PARENT.

110
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,220
EVERY DETECTIVE
ON THE FORCE

111
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,248
WAS WORKING SOME ANGLE
OF THAT CASE.

112
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,224
MY SQUAD,
WE WERE CHECKING OUT

113
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,492
THE CLUES
FROM THE KILLER'S JOURNAL.

114
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,291
HE KEPT A JOURNAL?

115
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,293
YOU BURIED THE LEAD,
AG[ CHUCKLES ]

116
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,225
DON'T WORRY.
I BROUGHT A COPY.

117
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,559
THEY FOUND THE ORIGINAL
IN THE WRECKED HOUSE.

118
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:26,395
THIS IS WHERE THE KILLER KEPT
TRACK OF ALL HIS CRUSHES.

119
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,504
"I MET THE MOST INCREDIBLE GIRL
ON THE EL TODAY.

120
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:30,566
LILY --
ISN'T THAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME?"

121
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,544
LILY PASETTI.
VICTIM NUMBER 3.

122
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,414
SOUNDS LIKE
HE WAS FIXATED ON HER.

123
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,243
YEAH, FOR A WEEK.

124
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,307
EVERY MONDAY AND TUESDAY,
HE'D MEET A NEW GIRL,

125
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:40,547
AND SHE'D BE "THE ONE."

126
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,281
ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY,

127
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,446
HE'D WRITE ABOUT DANCING
WITH THEM IN A CLUB

128
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,624
OR SWIMMING WITH THEM
AT THE LAKE.

129
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,622
AND EVERY SUNDAY,
IT WAS THE SAME THING --

130
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,564
HOW THE GIRL
DISAPPOINTED HIM,

131
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,529
HOW SHE'D BROKEN HIS HEART
OR TURNED OUT TO BE A PHONY.

132
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:54,399
"I BOUGHT SANDRA A DRINK
AT THE BLACKLIGHT."

133
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,428
ANYBODY AT THE BLACKLIGHT
SEE WHO BOUGHT HER A DRINK?

134
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,634
SHE WAS A HOT NUMBER.

135
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:00,425
FRIENDS SAID THERE WAS A TON
OF GUYS BUYING HER DRINKS.

136
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,438
BUT WE COULDN'T PUT
ANY ONE OF THOSE GUYS

137
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,540
AT THE CLUB
WHERE LILY WAS DANCING

138
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,412
OR SWIMMING AT THE LAKE
WITH SUZANNE.

139
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,340
BUT THE ENTRIES ABOUT LACEY
ARE DIFFERENT.

140
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,436
"I SAW LACEY TODAY,
AND I THOUGHT,

141
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,408
'WOW, SHE'S BEEN HERE
ALL SUMMER, EVERYWHERE I LOOK.'"

142
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,547
HE KNEW HER.

143
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,322
THAT'S WHY
WE WERE ALWAYS HOPING

144
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,590
THAT LACEY
WOULD COME AROUND,

145
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:21,288
BUT SHE'S NUTTIER
THAN GRANDMA'S FRUITCAKE.

146
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,461
SORRY, KATIE.

147
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,591
JUST A FIGURE OF SPEECH.

148
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,496
WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT

149
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,569
IS WHY HE WOULD TAKE IT UP AGAIN
AFTER A 26-YEAR VACATION.

150
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,440
MAYBE HE GOT SCARED AFTER
YOU FOUND HIS HIDEOUT,

151
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,439
OR MAYBE HE JUST FOUND
SOME OTHER WAY

152
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,311
TO SCRATCH
WHAT WAS ITCHING HIM.

153
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,639
EITHER WAY, IT'S TIME
TO GO TALK TO LACEY PENDERHALT.

154
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,475
THANKS.

155
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,451
AND MAYBE SOMEDAY
YOU'LL EVEN COME AROUND

156
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,309
WHEN YOU DON'T NEED
SOMETHING.

157
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,477
NO, NO, NO.
NO,DAD --O.

158
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:52,346
I UNDERSTAND, FRESH IN TOWN,
NEW JOB, LOTS TO DO.

159
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,356
SPEAKING
ABOUT FRESH IN TOWN,

160
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,459
WHEN IS DONNIE
COMING IN FROM D.C.?

161
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:00,661
SOON. DEFINITELY. YEAH, SOON.
I -- AND I'LL CALL YOU.

162
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,364
NICE TYEAH.T YOU.

163
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:05,596
WAIT.
I JUST REMEMBERED.

164
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:08,603
I MET YOU PARENTS' NIGHT,
KATIE'S FRESHMAN YEAR.

165
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,496
YOU'RE THE PROFESSOR
SHE HAD THE BIG CRUSH ON

166
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,368
THE WHOLE TIME
S[ SQUEALS ] NOPE..

167
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,536
WHAT?

168
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:22,377
SO, YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING
