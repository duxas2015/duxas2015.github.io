2
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:06,948
Does freewill exist?

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:13,612
Do I exert conscious
control over my actions?

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,764
Did I do that on purpose?

5
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:19,392
I'm pretty sure you did.

6
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:24,088
Or was I forced to do it by
some unseen neural process?

7
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,508
Fact is most of the neural-scientific
data suggests freewill..

8
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:30,358
Is an illusion.

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,255
Now if that's true.
Are we simply meat-puppets?

10
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:37,570
All of our choices made for us?

11
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:41,307
The answer to that can be found..

12
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,548
In our next class. Bye!

13
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,161
That's brilliant Daniel.

14
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:50,438
Ending the class on a cliff-hanger
always keeps them coming back for more.

15
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,130
- The answer is "no".
- To what?

16
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:53,778
To what ever it is you're about to ask me.

17
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:56,082
Unless I'm misinterpreting
the blatant ego stroking.

18
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,097
I simply want to make sure
you are planning to attend

19
00:00:58,098 --> 00:01:00,431
the Chicago Science
Foundation Gala on Friday.

20
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:02,417
Ah. You lost me at gala.

21
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:03,793
I really need you there Daniel.

22
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:05,315
- Why?
- Because.

23
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:07,385
Johnathan Bannister's widow
is going to be there.

24
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:08,263
I don't know who that is.

25
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:11,814
Class of '49. Anyway I played golf
with him a couple of months ago..

26
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:13,877
And by the end of the eighth hole..

27
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:17,177
I had him verbally committed to funding
the new Life Sciences building.

28
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:20,152
But a couple of days later,
before I can get it in writing,

29
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:21,944
the guy goes and dies of a heart attack.

30
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:23,502
How inconsiderate of him.

31
00:01:23,503 --> 00:01:25,271
I feel badly about it of course.

32
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:28,758
But I'm hoping to get his widow
to honor her husbands promise.

33
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,495
I'm still waiting to hear
what this has to do with me.

34
00:01:30,496 --> 00:01:33,653
Well, as luck would have it Mrs.
Bannister..

35
00:01:33,654 --> 00:01:35,350
Fan of yours.

36
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:38,579
No. No. No, I am not..

37
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,548
Going to let you pimp
me to some "blue-hair".

38
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:43,828
Just so the under graduates have a shiny
new building to store their mice.

39
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,212
No I don't have time
anyway, I'm right in the

40
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:48,881
middle of some very important experiments.

41
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:51,582
What experiments?

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,074
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

43
00:01:57,594 --> 00:01:59,634
Daniel?

44
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:01,308
What are you doing?

45
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:04,263
Did you know that pigeons
brains contain magnetite?

46
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:05,903
I did not know that.

47
00:02:05,904 --> 00:02:08,312
Let's them sense the Earth's
magnetic field and orientates them

48
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:10,200
so can get where they're
going without getting lost.

49
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,644
Here's the thing pigeons mate for life.

50
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:15,872
I'm wondering, after a while does the
female just follow her chosen male..

51
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:19,582
Or does she still use the magnetite
in her brain to choose her own route?

52
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:23,117
Probably depends on whether
he's buying her dinner.

53
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:27,117
You don't think they are going
to follow me home do you?

54
00:02:27,118 --> 00:02:29,653
To what do I owe the pleasure?

55
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:34,262
How would you like to help the FBI bring
down a big bad insurance company?

56
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,969
See I knew this was going to be a good day.

57
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,091
What did they do deny somebody benefits?

58
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:43,532
Actually they might have committed murder.

59
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,649
Sanjay Patel.

60
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,641
A couple of months ago he was admitted to
the ER complaining of severe depression.

61
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:55,135
Suicidal thoughts.

62
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,787
Janstar health was his insurance
provider at the time.

63
00:02:57,788 --> 00:03:00,499
They authorized one day of hospitalization.

64
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,791
- That's generous.
- It gets worse.

65
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:05,452
After he's discharged Janstar recommended..

66
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:09,427
Out-patient treatment, by a psychiatrist.
Dr. Julian Corvis.

67
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:11,856
Corvis treats Sanjay for four sessions.

68
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:14,784
Then stops treatment, says Sanjay's cured.

69
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:18,138
Of severe depression, in four sessions?
Bullshit.

70
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,692
Yeah. I'm sure Sanjay's Mother
shares your skepticism.

71
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:24,546
Next morning she found him
hanging in his closet.

72
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:27,334
How does a Doctor that incompetent
keep his medical license?

73
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:28,823
I do not know.

74
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:34,724
What I do know is that he will
never be treating patients again.

75
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:37,528
He was found dead in his office yesterday.

76
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:39,644
Shot in the face by a thirty-eight.

77
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:41,522
Wallet was still on him, so robbery is out.

78
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:44,807
Safe was open, but there
were still valuables inside.

79
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,758
It's unclear whether or
not anything was removed.

80
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,745
Sanjay's family seeking payback?

81
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:52,458
They seem to be going through
the proper channels.

82
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:55,856
They filed a wrongful death suit
against Janstar and Corvis.

83
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:59,623
And alerted the U.S. Attorney's office,
which launched an investigation.

84
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:02,115
FBI approached Corvis about testifying

85
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,956
against Janstar and he
agreed on one condition.

86
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:06,072
Immunity.

87
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:10,199
The terms of which were still being
negotiated, when he was killed.

88
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,591
So you think Janstar hired
a hit man to silence..

89
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:16,352
I am not assigned to
investigate the murder.

90
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:18,114
- But you said..
- My involvement in this case

91
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:20,571
is limited to the wrongful death suit.

92
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:22,940
We need to find out what
was in Corvis's files.

93
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:25,209
You can't look at medical
files, they're confidential.

94
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,165
That's why I need a special master.

95
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,385
Special what?

96
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:35,268
A knowledgeable and impartial
third party to review the files.

97
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:37,882
And report on what Corvis was
going to tell the U.S. Attorney.

98
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:41,838
Without revealing any personal information.

99
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,326
That's why I convinced the
US Attorney to appoint you.

100
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,768
Ah.

101
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,897
Well as flattered as I am
that you think I'm special..

102
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,198
I know you Kate..

103
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,019
And there's no way you're not
curious about who killed Corvis.

104
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,009
I've been in some hot water
with the boss lately.

105
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,432
He says I keep stepping outside
my circle of responsibility.

106
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:07,233
So this time I am staying
inside the circle.

107
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,147
So what exactly is the
diameter of this circle?

108
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:12,110
Pretty small.

109
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,456
- Hey Kate.
- Michael.

110
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:16,127
Let me guess.
You're here to take me to lunch.

111
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:18,522
Actually I am here to see Daniel.

112
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:20,589
Uh, sorry.
Sorry do you two know each other?

113
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,715
Of course. I mean half the
reason I joined the faculty

114
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:25,247
was to say I have worked
with the great Dr. Pierce.

115
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,873
Good to see you Daniel.

116
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:29,534
So.. When are we getting together again?

117
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:31,239
Well, I don't know I might have..

118
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,079
We have something that we're doing.

119
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,070
Sorry.

120
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:37,497
Totally understand I'll call you.

121
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:39,418
Okay.

122
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,478
Where do you think you're going?

123
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,101
I'm the only one who's allowed
to look at these files.

124
00:05:48,102 --> 00:05:49,956
I'm only going up to unlock the office.

125
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:51,240
Just so you remember.

126
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:55,381
You're the special master I got it.

127
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:01,840
It's a fresh crime scene this
seal is supposed to be intact.

128
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:04,121
Wait here.

129
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:25,490
Mrs. Corvis?

130
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:29,511
It was on our honeymoon Bora Bora.

131
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:33,751
It was the happiest week of my life.

132
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:36,508
The FBI should have protected Julian.

133
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:38,959
Maybe you should get her home.

134
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,484
You sure?

135
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:41,673
I'll be fine.

136
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:43,766
Mrs. Corvis..

137
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:49,667
We're going to do everything we can
to find the person who did this.

138
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:27,908
How is she?

139
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:29,869
Getting some rest.

140
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,478
You find anything?

141
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,231
Apparently Corvis was
miraculously curing his Janstar

142
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:37,226
patients of major disorders
in just a few sessions.

143
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:40,105
Where as patients from other
carriers, same disorders..

144
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:42,244
He'd see thirty of forty times.

145
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:45,794
So you think Janstar was getting Corvis
to turn their patients then dump them.

146
00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:49,381
Yup. They paid him a major bonus
every time he cut somebody loose.

147
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:51,941
They'd save a bundle.
He'd fill his schedule with

148
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:54,444
patients that were from other
carriers or paying cash.

149
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:55,922
Nice work Daniel.

150
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:59,467
You testify to this, the U.S.
Attorney should be able to nail Janstar.

151
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:02,021
There's something else. Look at this.

152
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:06,245
Corvis was diagnosing a disorder called
Transformation Dopamine Deficiency.

153
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:08,712
- Never heard of it.
- Neither have I.

154
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:11,758
It's not in the Diagnostic
Statistical Manual.

155
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,280
Do you think it's related
to the Janstar scam?

156
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:16,975
No. Everyone with this
diagnosis was paying cash.

157
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:19,525
Suspicious, right?

158
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:22,062
If it's not related to Janstar
it's outside the circle.

159
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:27,283
- It doesn't make any sense..
- Outside the circle.

160
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:30,270
You found the smoking gun.

161
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:32,134
I'll Buy you a celebratory slice of pizza.

162
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,708
Malnati's?

163
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,637
Did you know that humans
are the only species

164
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:37,045
that drinks the milk of another animal?

165
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:40,378
It's.. It's unnatural, the
lactose turning away we..

166
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,639
Okay Daniel I am not hungry any more.

167
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:04,005
Lewicki..

168
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,390
Oh, hi Professor Pierce.

169
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:09,664
Got a sec?

170
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,945
Excuse me.

171
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:17,694
What is that girls doing here?

172
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:20,367
Uh, I'm Karen's teaching assistant.
She asked for my help and I'm helping her.

173
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:23,140
Oh, so you couldn't help her
at the dorm, or the library?

174
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:25,317
- What's your point?
- My point is, that girl stalked me.

175
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:27,752
She almost got me fired now shes
finagled her way in to my house.

176
00:09:27,753 --> 00:09:29,710
- She has ulterior motives.
- Okay maybe she does.

177
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,627
Okay now that we see eye to eye.
Get out of here.

178
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:34,605
Ever occur to you that her
ulterior motive is to get with me?

179
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:39,106
Hey Max, I should go. It's getting late.

180
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:43,775
Um, okay yeah, I'll..
I'll walk you back to your dorm.

181
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:46,400
See ya Professor Pierce.

182
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:48,270
I think you're just jealous.

183
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,401
Of Lewicki?

184
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:51,173
That girl took her shirt
off in your office.

185
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,419
And you didn't find her
the least bit attractive?

186
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,799
I may be crazy from the neck up,

187
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,096
but from the waist down I assure
you I'm perfectly healthy.

188
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,413
When was the last time you had a date?

189
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:00,940
Is that a proposition?

190
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:01,987
In your dreams.

191
00:10:01,988 --> 00:10:03,680
Hey we had fun together.

192
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:06,976
Had past tense. You need to find
somebody in the here and now.

193
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:09,525
Like your friend Kate is
doing with Michael Hathaway.

194
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,722
Oh..

195
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:13,719
That's called setting the bar so
low that anyone is acceptable.

196
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,783
As opposed to setting the
bar so unrealistically high

197
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:21,424
that you never have to show
another person the real you?

198
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,935
Are you feeling okay?

199
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:28,722
I'm having some symptoms, but
I know they're symptoms.

200
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:29,793
Such as?

201
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:32,727
I'm being followed by a Government
Agent in a black S.U.V.

202
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:34,790
Are you sure it's a hallucination?

203
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:38,511
Black S.U.V.? Mirrored shades.

204
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:45,598
Straight out of the
Paranoid Skitzo handbook.

205
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:53,250
I dropped Karen off at her dorm uh..

206
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:54,660
I'm gonna crash.

207
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:55,704
You need anything first?

208
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:59,567
Don't forget your umbrellas or
otherwise you could get all wet.

209
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,563
50 percent chance of rain.

210
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:04,171
How does this woman stay employed
when her forecast is basically..

211
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:06,046
It might rain or it might not.

212
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:09,694
Well I think she has other assets
that keep her employed Doc.

213
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,363
Winds creeping in from North-West Indiana.

214
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:14,644
Clearly understanding
meteorology isn't one of them.

215
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:18,092
That's not a very nice thing to say Daniel.

216
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:20,795
By the weekend, it looks
like more of the same.

217
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,582
So I miss a tropical
depression once in a while.

218
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,108
You can miss depression too. Can't you?

219
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:27,770
But the weather should be improving..

220
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,041
I missed something.

221
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:32,047
Good news is were not expecting
any more rain on the horizon.

222
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:34,663
And right now it's just a
lovely evening out there.

223
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:36,877
You okay Doc?

224
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:39,338
Get the car.

225
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:45,213
Daniel, what are you doing?
You're supposed to wait for me.

226
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:47,292
I think I know who killed Corvis.

227
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:49,124
- Who?
- I can't tell you.

228
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,345
Why not?

229
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:54,186
Because it's outside the circle.

230
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,598
Your son was Dr. Corvis's patient.

231
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:04,355
He just went the one time.

232
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,996
Were you aware that..

233
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:08,389
Justin threatened to kill him?

234
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,976
No.

235
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:11,744
No I wasn't.

236
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:13,231
You don't think he had
anything to do with..

237
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,963
At this point we just want to talk to him.

238
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:19,689
During his session Justin
became aggressive and violent.

239
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,799
So much so, that Doctor Corvis
recommended he find a new therapist.

240
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,425
- Did he?
- No.

241
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:29,471
No he came home that day
shouting and screaming and..

242
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:32,829
He was angry at me for
sending him to see Corvis.

243
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,021
And then he just..

244
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,546
Then he just took off.

245
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,062
His Mother..

246
00:12:39,063 --> 00:12:44,154
She knew how to handle Justin
a lot better than I did.

247
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:47,515
She died three years ago.

248
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:52,383
Must have been very hard for both of you.

249
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:55,098
Is that why you thought Justin
should see a therapist?

250
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,747
No he..

251
00:12:56,748 --> 00:13:00,086
He handled it pretty well, you
know all things considered.

252
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:01,815
He loved his music.

253
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:05,415
He had plenty of good friends. And uh..

254
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,857
And then everything just changed.

255
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:09,718
How?

256
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:12,425
Teenage stuff mostly.

257
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,930
He started running around
with the wrong crowd.

258
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:19,663
And I thought Corvis could help him get
back on the right track. You know?

259
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:25,419
Dr. Corvis diagnosed him with something
called Transformation Dopamine Deficiency.

260
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,515
Do you know what that means?

261
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:28,905
Uh, I'm sorry I don't.

262
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:33,946
And you have no idea where
Justin is right now?

263
00:13:33,998 --> 00:13:37,086
I haven't seen my son
since he left this house.

264
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:40,447
If you find him. Please..

265
00:13:40,473 --> 00:13:44,431
Will you tell him that I am sorry?

266
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,132
About everything.

267
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:55,142
Thanks.

268
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:58,829
No hits on Justin Reycraft
with FBI or Chicago P.D.

269
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,912
Think he'll turn up?

270
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:03,683
It's hard to say. Sometimes runaways
do just drop off the grid completely.

271
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:06,344
But we've got an APB out.

272
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,116
So uh..

273
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:10,749
Your boss knows you've
drifted outside the circle?

274
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,010
Yeah, he's giving me a little leeway.

275
00:14:15,217 --> 00:14:17,338
- What's up?
- Nothing.

276
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:23,099
I was just trying to figure out
what this diagnosis means.

277
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:26,592
What the..

278
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:32,293
Federal Agent hands where I can see 'em.
Out of the car!

279
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:36,063
You better have one hell
of a good reason for

280
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:39,263
following us around the
past couple of days.

281
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:40,516
I don't believe it.

282
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,296
Secret Service guy in aviator sun glasses,

283
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:44,331
and a black S.U.V.
was really following us?

284
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:45,797
I know..

285
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:48,618
How cliche. Right?

286
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:54,106
Pulled you personnel file Vincent.

287
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:57,038
Nine complaints of excessive force.

288
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,098
Drinking on the job.

289
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:02,465
You want to tell me what a burn out cop
is doing following around the FBI?

290
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:06,038
You want to know what's great about
not being on the job any more?

291
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,075
Hmm?

292
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:09,338
I don't have to talk to people like you.

293
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,177
Want to know what else is great about
you not being a cop any more Vincent?

294
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:17,004
Is that no one will give a rats ass when I
ship you for assaulting a Federal Agent.

295
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:19,306
Never laid a finger on you.

296
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:22,118
It's too bad you didn't pay
more attention in the academy.

297
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:24,862
Because then you would
know that hitting my car..

298
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:26,954
Qualifies as assault.

299
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:29,535
A felony even.

300
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:34,201
I'm working as an investigator
for Janstar, so what.

301
00:15:34,202 --> 00:15:37,035
So what happened?
They find out Corvis was gonna testify.

302
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,505
So they sent you to dig up some
dirt to blackmail him with?

303
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,720
Or maybe..

304
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:45,758
They sent you to silence him for good.

305
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,394
I was just hired to follow him.

306
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:51,724
Dig up dirt like you said.

307
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:55,545
Well if you were following him,
maybe you saw who killed him.

308
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:57,478
I was at an AA meeting when it happened.

309
00:15:57,479 --> 00:16:01,238
By the time I got back to his office
it was already a crime scene.

310
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:04,707
The cop in me is curious, so I hung
around and when you and your..

311
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,040
Weird Professor friend..

312
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,709
Show up. I run a background
find out who he is.

313
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,812
Report back to Janstar that maybe
he's gonna testify in Corvis's place.

314
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:17,426
So they told you to follow Dr.
Pierce, dig up some dirt on him too?

315
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:18,617
Instead of riding me why aren't you looking

316
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:21,051
for the guy who threatened
Corvis last week?

317
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:22,288
Keep talking.

318
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:25,754
He goes to some girls apartment,
comes out about an hour later.

319
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:28,399
Some big guy's waiting
for him, throws Corvis

320
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,200
up against a car threatens
to break his head.

321
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:32,424
Give me a name.

322
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,011
I didn't get his name.

323
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:37,431
But I got the girls.

324
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:38,888
I loved Julian.

325
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,836
But you knew he was married Misty.

326
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:44,534
I couldn't help myself.
We just had this crazy connection.

327
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:48,915
And the sex was absolutely mind blowing.

328
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:51,496
I would know too, I've
had like a ton of sex.

329
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:53,357
Huh.

330
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:55,128
But with Julian it was different.

331
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,176
He was so in to experimenting
and exploring..

332
00:16:57,177 --> 00:17:00,552
Sounds awesome Misty.
But this is a murder investigation.

333
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,937
Now a witness says they saw Corvis
being threatened outside your place.

334
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:06,351
What do you know about that?

335
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:08,564
It was probably Toby, my ex.

336
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:10,194
He's got a really bad temper.

337
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:16,075
And he was pretty upset when I
started sleeping with Julian.

338
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:27,588
Alright, I need you to wait in the car.

339
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,288
Toby Mulligan?

340
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,450
Who's asking?

341
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:40,090
FBI I've got a couple questions for you.

342
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,221
Just let me finish this set.

343
00:17:42,222 --> 00:17:46,036
Actually I need to talk to you right now.

344
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:48,317
Okay sure.

345
00:17:56,624 --> 00:18:00,104
What? I waited in the car.

346
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,323
Yeah, I got in his face.
But it didn't hurt him.

347
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:08,109
I wasn't even in town last Friday.

348
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,218
- Then why'd you run?
- I thought this was about the steroids.

349
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:16,176
I totally have a prescription
for those by the way.

350
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:19,754
Admit it Toby, you were pissed off
because some Joe shmoe Doctor

351
00:18:19,755 --> 00:18:22,936
half your size was giving it to
your girl and she was liking it.

352
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,369
So you made him pay.

353
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,046
I told you I didn't kill him.

354
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:29,250
When did you find out she was seeing him?

355
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,950
You mean sleeping together as his patient?

356
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:33,867
Misty was Corvis's patient?

357
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:36,739
She started seeing him, for
her self esteem issues.

358
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,260
She seemed pretty confident to me.

359
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:39,661
Maybe he cured her.

360
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:41,918
He got inside her head.
Tricked her somehow.

361
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,370
There's no way she'd have
cheated on me otherwise.

362
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:48,636
I even told his wife about it.

363
00:18:48,637 --> 00:18:53,010
Thought that would end it, but it didn't.

364
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:57,709
Of course I knew.
I knew about all of my husbands affairs.

365
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,661
How many were there?

366
00:18:59,662 --> 00:19:01,721
A few. Nothing out of the ordinary.

367
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:02,726
Hm.

368
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:05,216
I liked that other women
found my husband attractive.

369
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:06,812
It made me feel lucky to have him.

370
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,052
Oh, you have a very progressive attitude

371
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:13,310
towards your husbands
extracurricular activity's.

372
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:16,412
That's just what normal men do.

373
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:18,213
Hm.

374
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:20,205
That woman is lying.

375
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:23,108
Everyone has a different
attitude, when it come to sex.

376
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:25,620
You get cheated on you
feel angry, betrayed.

377
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:28,014
You want someone to pay, trust me.

378
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:31,005
It doesn't sound like you're being
entirely objective Agent Moretti.

379
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:35,403
Sorry. Look, I'm just saying she might seem
like the poster child for cool right now.

380
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:37,668
But maybe when she found out
Corvis was cheating on her.

381
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:39,294
She got jealous and killed him.

382
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:40,795
But you didn't accuse her.

383
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:42,833
That's because I don't
have any evidence.. Yet.

384
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,206
I gotta look in to her movements
on the day of the murder.

385
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:48,507
Drop you back at campus?

386
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:53,733
Look at us. Just a couple of higher order
primates competing for a sexual partner.

387
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,369
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm talking about Kate of course.

388
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,576
And well I'll just say it..

389
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:00,415
I sense she's very attracted to me.

390
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,925
But if your planning to plant your
flag in that terra incognita..

391
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:07,698
Then just say the word and
I'll gracefully withdraw.

392
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:11,910
Look.. If your done mangling
metaphors I have a class.

393
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,851
So you don't mind?

394
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:21,325
Lewicki?

395
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:24,932
Lewicki!

396
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:28,652
Lewicki.

397
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:31,060
- Yea.
- Lewick..

398
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,549
Where the hell were you?
You were supposed to bring my

399
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,580
notes for the Neural Anatomy seminar.
I had to cancel.

400
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:37,251
Look I'm sorry Doc. I'm sorry. What..

401
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,868
What happened was I had
to take my clothes off..

402
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,535
To do the laundry and uh..

403
00:20:41,536 --> 00:20:43,414
I put my clothes in the wash and uh..

404
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:46,414
When I came back to check on them
the washer was set on delicate.

405
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:49,821
So I had to wash them all over again.

406
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:52,822
Hey Professor Pierce.

407
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:16,627
Yeah. I.. I.. Told you she was in to me.

408
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:22,160
Uh, Dr. Pierce's residence.

409
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:23,938
One sec.

410
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:25,654
It's Kate.

411
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:26,676
Hello.

412
00:21:26,677 --> 00:21:29,362
Chicago P.D. picked up Justin Reycraft.

413
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:31,418
You know the kid who was
threatening Corvis.

414
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:33,524
Panhandling in Millennium Park.

415
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,994
They're bringing him in to talk
to me, you want to come say hi?

416
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:39,535
You have no idea, how much.

417
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,458
So then you won't be back for awhile?

418
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:47,421
Why'd you run away Justin?

419
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:49,702
I didn't.

420
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:52,268
My Dad kicked me out.

421
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,200
Why.. Why did he do that?

422
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:57,505
Because I wouldn't go back
to see that weirdo Corvis.

423
00:21:57,506 --> 00:22:00,768
Mr. Corvis says here in his
files that you threatened him.

424
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:02,426
- Did you kill him?
- No.

425
00:22:02,427 --> 00:22:03,746
I didn't kill him.

426
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:05,410
What made you so angry at him?

427
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,207
That guy was a total freak.

428
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,241
Okay.

429
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:13,102
We just want to hear
your side of the story.

430
00:22:14,952 --> 00:22:18,167
My Dad forced me to go see Corvis.

431
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:20,589
Then he gives me some pill.

432
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,130
What kind of pill?

433
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:24,080
I don't know.

434
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:29,164
Maybe one of those pills they give to old
men to make them all hot and bothered.

435
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:32,098
Guess it was supposed to
do the same thing to me.

436
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:33,263
Then he..

437
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:35,848
Makes me watch all this porn.

438
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:38,513
It was girls with other girls.

439
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:41,634
Then he wants me to..

440
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,674
You know.

441
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:45,794
While I'm watching the porn.

442
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:48,274
In front of him.

443
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:51,373
He said it would help re-teach my brain.

444
00:22:51,374 --> 00:22:53,958
He said it was part of the cure.

445
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,367
Cure for what?

446
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:59,608
The cure for being gay.

447
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:07,644
Thank you.

448
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:10,620
Well, Justins alibi checks out.

449
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:12,754
He was at the Mercy Shelter
the night Corvis was killed.

450
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:16,844
Of course he didn't do it. He's a sweet
kid who's philistine Father conveniently

451
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:20,167
fails to mention that he threw his own
son out of the house for being gay.

452
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:22,318
Or how'd he put it?
Hanging with the wrong crowd.

453
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,896
He sounded pretty remorseful
when I talked to him.

454
00:23:24,897 --> 00:23:27,233
And incredibly relived
that Justin was okay.

455
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:29,521
You know I think there's a chance
those two could work things out.

456
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:32,184
Well at least now we know what
Transformation Dopamine Deficiency is.

457
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:34,445
It's Corvis's code for homosexuality.

458
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,212
It's so sad that someone could
be so ashamed of who the are.

459
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:39,807
That they'd go to some
quack Doctor to cure them.

460
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:42,787
Grow up with a family that tells you that
your basic impulses are morally repugnant.

461
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,594
You might try anything to
make yourself feel normal.

462
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:47,157
Kids kill themselves because of it.

463
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:52,002
Okay, but is it relevant
to who killed Corvis?

464
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:53,872
He creates a disorder..

465
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:57,389
That doesn't exist. Then he comes up
with a treatment regiment for it.

466
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,283
And Justin was pretty angry at Corvis
for putting him through it so..

467
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:02,648
Maybe one of his other
patients is angry too.

468
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,565
We can't interview them
because of confidentially.

469
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:07,379
You cant..

470
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,775
But I can.

471
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:11,554
- Because I'm..
- The special master.

472
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:14,305
How could I forget?

473
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:15,800
This is completely confidential.

474
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:19,157
The only way I'd divulge anything is if
it were relevant to the Doctor's murder.

475
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:22,453
We'll do what ever we can to help.

476
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:24,606
How did you find Dr. Corvis?

477
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:25,481
Church.

478
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:26,657
A support group.

479
00:24:26,658 --> 00:24:28,718
My pastor recommended him.

480
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,713
And why did you go to him?

481
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:35,401
I've been struggling with
these urges for years.

482
00:24:35,402 --> 00:24:38,789
I tried everything already.
Support groups, counseling.

483
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,297
Nothing helped.

484
00:24:40,298 --> 00:24:42,435
Dr. Corvis said his
treatment was different.

485
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:43,453
Different how?

486
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:46,096
He said that the thing that I
struggled with my entire life.

487
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:49,003
The thing that has given
me so much heartache.

488
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:51,764
Wasn't my fault.

489
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:53,442
It wasn't a choice.

490
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:55,230
He said it was disease.

491
00:24:55,231 --> 00:25:00,151
A Neurochemical Disorder
and he could treat it.

492
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,340
What was the treatment regimen?

493
00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:05,184
First he would give me a pill.

494
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:07,506
- What pill?
- We only got it in his office.

495
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:11,975
He promised us it was safe, but he said it
wasn't approved for sale yet or something.

496
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:13,121
But you took it anyway?

497
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:14,814
I was desperate.

498
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,262
I was willing to try anything.

499
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:18,039
What happened after you took the pill?

500
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,273
I got this..

501
00:25:20,274 --> 00:25:22,708
Incredible feeling of love.

502
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:23,937
Got me excited.

503
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:25,270
I'd become aroused.

504
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:27,041
Then we made love.

505
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:28,588
We would have sex.

506
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:29,691
In front of him?

507
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:32,646
Sometimes he would make me watch porn.

508
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:36,649
Other time he brought
in a sexual surrogate.

509
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,624
He forced you to have sex with a woman?

510
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,705
No. I wanted to.

511
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,197
And how did the treatment work?

512
00:25:42,198 --> 00:25:45,809
We haven't had a treatment
in almost six weeks.

513
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,926
We..

514
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:48,262
We haven't needed it.

515
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:50,107
Dr. Corvis saved our marriage.

516
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:51,297
He was the miracle worker.

517
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:54,658
Dr. Corvis saved my life.

518
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,224
The sex was mind blowing.

519
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,680
Wow that must have been some interview.

520
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:03,034
It's what Misty said about her bedroom
gymnastics with Corvis, remember?

521
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:04,705
He must have been giving her the drug too.

522
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:07,530
- What Viagra?
- No Viagra only affects blood flow.

523
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:11,213
Corvis told his patients that being
gay is a Neurochemical Disorder.

524
00:26:11,214 --> 00:26:13,207
It's like the feeling of
being in love originates

525
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,345
in the paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus.

526
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:16,820
Oh, Daniel you're such a romantic.

527
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:19,236
The drug must have been something
that affected the brain.

528
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:21,915
I'm guessing some kind of
selective dopamine agonist.

529
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,511
That produces the sensation
of being in love.

530
00:26:24,512 --> 00:26:27,391
Then Corvis incorporates some
cognitive behavioral techniques.

531
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:29,478
So the patient experiences those feelings,

532
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,550
while having sex with a female
and that behavior imprints,

533
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,320
on them and creates a new normal.

534
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:35,966
Somebody paid attention in class.

535
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,919
Wait so this treatment actually works?

536
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,413
Temporarily maybe. But it's not
sophisticated enough to create the kind of

537
00:26:41,414 --> 00:26:45,599
lasting neurobiological changes that could
actually alter a person's sexuality.

538
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,939
But it's possible?

539
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,420
Theoretically. But ethically?

540
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:55,401
If the drugs are still in any
of the patients systems..

541
00:26:55,402 --> 00:26:57,640
We test their blood, we find
out exactly what it is.

542
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:59,842
We don't have enough probable
cause to get a blood order.

543
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:02,764
Plus it might be pretty difficult to
get permission from the patients.

544
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:06,313
It would be an admission that they
were doing something illegal.

545
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:09,531
Silly Daniel you don't
need anyone's permission.

546
00:27:09,532 --> 00:27:10,808
What are you talking about?

547
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:14,336
I'm saying it might pretty difficult
to get the patients to cooperate.

548
00:27:14,337 --> 00:27:19,956
That's true but you can't refuse
to cooperate if you're dead.

549
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:22,905
Did the medical examiner's office
keep samples of Corvis's blood?

550
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:25,823
Yeah, of course why?

551
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,797
I think we're going to find
traces of the drug in his system.

552
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:31,797
Because he wanted to have mind
blowing sex just like his patients.

553
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:33,198
I think it's more then that.

554
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:36,741
I think he was trying to cure himself.

555
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:39,922
Because Corvis was gay.

556
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:47,104
The M.E. tested your
husbands blood Mrs. Corvis.

557
00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:52,990
Turns out he was treating himself with
a drug called ZR-121 which causes..

558
00:27:52,991 --> 00:27:54,700
Feelings of love and arousal.

559
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:57,939
Now the FDA hasn't approved it yet
because of pervasive side effects.

560
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,779
Like Hypertension,
Ptosis, Dry Mouth.

561
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,634
What's your point?

562
00:28:02,635 --> 00:28:05,933
Your husband was trying to cure himself..

563
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,283
Of being gay.

564
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:11,054
He did cure himself.

565
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:13,163
Julian was a revolutionary.

566
00:28:13,164 --> 00:28:16,136
His methods were saving marriages.
Saving lives.

567
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:18,867
Except, being gay isn't a disease.

568
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:21,256
Clearly that's a matter of opinion.

569
00:28:21,257 --> 00:28:25,156
My husband offered hope to
people who shared our beliefs.

570
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:29,417
Except he never actually cured himself.

571
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:32,750
We tracked his credit card
bill and found numerous..

572
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:37,637
Charges to a company called CKL
Restaurant & Lounge Group.

573
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:42,047
Seems it's a holding company
for a bar in boys town.

574
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:45,583
We sent an Agent down there to see
if anybody recognized your husband.

575
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:48,498
And turns out he was a regular.

576
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:53,086
I'm sure he was just offering
to help those poor men.

577
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:55,066
You wanted your husband to be straight.

578
00:28:55,067 --> 00:29:00,087
So badly that you even encouraged him
to cheat on you with other women.

579
00:29:00,088 --> 00:29:04,691
Because as you said that's
just what normal men do.

580
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:08,011
But when you found out
that it was all a lie..

581
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,875
That he was never going to be
what you considered normal..

582
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:15,133
You couldn't take it.
And that's when you killed him.

583
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:20,628
I'm not saying another word
until I speak with my attorney.

584
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:22,208
Moretti.

585
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:24,609
Oh hey Max.

586
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:26,917
He says it's an emergency.

587
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:29,018
Lewicki?

588
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:33,620
She's been like that for hours.

589
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:36,566
She says she'll only talk to you.

590
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,394
Alright. Get her some water.

591
00:29:38,395 --> 00:29:40,315
Okay.

592
00:29:42,936 --> 00:29:45,276
Uh.. Karen?

593
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,293
Why don't you uh..

594
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:52,494
Why don't you tell me what's wrong?

595
00:29:53,013 --> 00:29:56,075
You're an expert on the brain right?

596
00:29:56,076 --> 00:29:58,296
And why..

597
00:29:58,654 --> 00:30:00,981
Why people do the things that they do?

598
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:04,080
Yes. But to be honest human
behaviour continues to mystify me.

599
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:07,452
That's why you just have to help me.

600
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:10,573
Tell me why I do it.

601
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:12,105
Do what?

602
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:13,860
I've..

603
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:17,357
I've been sleeping around lately.

604
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:20,538
- A lot.
- Okay, okay.

605
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,668
I have these urges and..

606
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:25,157
And I can't control them and..

607
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:28,259
I got excited watching the
golf channel the other day.

608
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,929
It just.. It doesn't make any sense.

609
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,080
Like sleeping with Max.

610
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:38,381
He's a really nice guy.

611
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,909
But I'm not that in to him.

612
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,516
I..

613
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:47,852
I would.. I would kill for a cigarette.

614
00:30:47,853 --> 00:30:50,248
I didn't know you smoked.

615
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:53,969
Oh, I've been trying to quit.

616
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:58,976
Are you taking a prescription
to help you with that?

617
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:01,659
How did you know?

618
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,598
Karen one of the side effects of some of

619
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,125
those anti-smoking drugs
is hyper-sexuality.

620
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:09,590
Maybe that's what's happening to you.

621
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:11,871
You think?

622
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:15,769
I know the Head of Counseling
at the Student Health Center.

623
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:19,305
She can talk to you about
your meds and your other..

624
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:23,213
Issues. So why..
Why don't I take you to see her?

625
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,874
Oh thank you Professor Pierce.

626
00:31:27,072 --> 00:31:29,532
You're welcome.

627
00:31:34,004 --> 00:31:37,439
Dean Haley.. Uh, Dr.
Pierce should be back any minute.

628
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,392
No I'm actually here to
see you Mister Lewicki.

629
00:31:41,393 --> 00:31:45,835
Look if it's about that girl,
I can totally explain.

630
00:31:45,836 --> 00:31:49,867
Its about the Chicago
Science Foundation benefit.

631
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,429
Oh.

632
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,154
Right. Of.. Of course.

633
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:56,533
It would behoove the university greatly..

634
00:31:56,534 --> 00:32:00,279
Mr. Lewicki if Doctor Pierce were
there this evening on time..

635
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,820
Wearing a tux. And a smile.

636
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:06,720
The problem is, Sir..

637
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:09,705
Dr. Pierce would rather eat a
plate of warm mayonnaise then..

638
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:11,899
Yeah, but you see tonight could mean..

639
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,823
A lot of funding for very
important programs..

640
00:32:14,824 --> 00:32:17,698
At the school including
teacher assistant-ships

641
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:20,556
in the Neuroscience Department.

642
00:32:20,557 --> 00:32:23,690
But on the other hand if
that funding should..

643
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,586
Come up short..

644
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:28,550
Do we understand each other Mister Lewicki?

645
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:29,647
Perfectly, Sir.

646
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,585
I'm so glad.

647
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:33,849
You enjoy the rest of your day.

648
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,450
Mr. Lewicki.. I know I will.

649
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,456
- Daniel.
- Huh.

650
00:32:40,498 --> 00:32:42,825
- What was he doing here?
- Nothing.

651
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:44,250
How's Karen?

652
00:32:44,251 --> 00:32:46,068
She'll be fine.

653
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:48,443
She was pretty ashamed.

654
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:50,372
Yeah, me too.

655
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:53,880
I'm Karen's T.A.
and I took advantage of that.

656
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:57,001
I abused my authority.

657
00:32:57,346 --> 00:33:00,070
You abused your authority.

658
00:33:00,071 --> 00:33:02,593
Geez Doc, you don't have
to rub it in, okay.

659
00:33:02,594 --> 00:33:04,058
I feel bad enough.

660
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:06,674
Don't be a narcissist Lewicki,
this isn't about you.

661
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:08,541
I gotta call Kate.

662
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:10,402
Why?

663
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:14,651
Because I think Corvis might
have abused his authority too.

664
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:19,272
I'm pretty sure it's what got him killed.

665
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:23,176
Thank you for coming back.

666
00:33:23,177 --> 00:33:26,897
- Hi.
- Hi Agent Moretti, FBI.

667
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,994
I don't understand why she's here.

668
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:33,731
I thought everything we talked
about was confidential.

669
00:33:33,732 --> 00:33:34,876
It is.

670
00:33:34,877 --> 00:33:39,778
Unless it's relevant to the
Corvis murder investigation.

671
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,359
- Hello.
- Hi.

672
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:45,926
Thomas, I noticed your eye before.

673
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:48,464
How long has it been like that?

674
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:50,784
This? I don't know.

675
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:52,390
Couple weeks maybe, why?

676
00:33:52,391 --> 00:33:55,293
One of the side effects of the drug
Corvis was giving you is Ptosis.

677
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:58,256
Otherwise known as drooping eyelid.

678
00:33:58,257 --> 00:34:00,226
What's this all about?

679
00:34:00,227 --> 00:34:02,638
Your husband shouldn't still
be experiencing side effects,

680
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:06,255
from a drug he supposedly
quit taking six weeks ago.

681
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:07,650
I.. I.. Don't know what
this has to with any..

682
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:12,343
You told Dr. Pierce the last time you
took the drug was at your last session.

683
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:14,844
Why are you lying Thomas?

684
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,450
- I'm not..
- Thomas?

685
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:23,190
Okay I'm still taking it, the drug.
But only so that I could be with you.

686
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:25,745
It helps with my condition.

687
00:34:25,746 --> 00:34:27,109
Where'd you get it?

688
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,610
I had some left over.

689
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:34,511
But you both said Corvis insisted you
only take the drug in his office.

690
00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:37,856
I was having a relapse.
So I went back to see him on my own.

691
00:34:37,857 --> 00:34:40,903
I didn't tell you because I
didn't want you to get upset.

692
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:43,327
Yeah, but that's not why he
gave you the pills, is it?

693
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,539
You and Corvis were
sleeping together and you

694
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,003
were taking the drugs to enhance the sex.

695
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:50,308
Thomas what's he talking about?

696
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:53,669
That's a pretty good act Mrs. Akers.

697
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,186
But we ran a trace and we found the

698
00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:57,917
thirty-eight that you
registered in college.

699
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,377
Police are executing a search
warrant on your house right now.

700
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:04,518
And they're going to find that gun.

701
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:07,408
Michelle..

702
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:08,680
What happened?

703
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:12,572
You find out he was sleeping
with Corvis so you shot him?

704
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:13,993
That's not..

705
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:16,917
You're right. I did it I'm sorry.

706
00:35:16,918 --> 00:35:19,122
Michelle, don't.

707
00:35:19,123 --> 00:35:21,163
Don't.

708
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:28,063
I just wanted a regular marriage.

709
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:32,264
Like the kind you see in the movies.

710
00:35:34,387 --> 00:35:37,504
That's why I forced Thomas
to go see Dr. Corvis.

711
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:40,085
Because I thought he
would fix our marriage.

712
00:35:40,086 --> 00:35:42,906
But he ruined it.

713
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,893
So I got my gun, and I shot him.

714
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:52,249
I understand what you're doing Mrs. Akers.

715
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,450
You pushed Thomas in to the treatment.
You feel responsible for what happened.

716
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:58,804
- No. No.
- You love him so you want to protect him.

717
00:35:58,805 --> 00:36:04,277
But you're not really going to let your
wife take the fall for something you did..

718
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:06,086
Are you Thomas?

719
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:09,567
Thomas, don't say anything.

720
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:17,383
- No. No he's right.
- Don't.

721
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:25,011
He's right I've been carrying
this around far too long.

722
00:36:30,215 --> 00:36:34,468
When Michelle and I first
started seeing Dr. Corvis..

723
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:36,765
The treatment was working.

724
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:42,025
I would take the drug and it would
make me feel things for my wife. But..

725
00:36:42,026 --> 00:36:44,025
As the sessions continued.

726
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:47,300
I started having feelings for Julian.

727
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:52,050
So he called me and asked me to
come in for a private session.

728
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:55,082
I started talking about my problem but..

729
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:58,563
We couldn't help ourselves.

730
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,176
I hated myself.

731
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:09,654
Michelle and I went to Julian
so that I could be with her.

732
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:12,595
Because I love her.

733
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:16,688
What we were doing was wrong.

734
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:19,423
So I went back to his
office to get the pills.

735
00:37:19,424 --> 00:37:23,444
So I could use them with my wife.

736
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:26,054
What you and I are. What we want.

737
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:28,177
It's not a disease I realize that now.

738
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:31,663
I.. I've been trying to convince
my patients, convince myself..

739
00:37:31,664 --> 00:37:33,724
But I've been living a lie.

740
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:35,536
- I see that now.
- No.

741
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:38,395
We can be together.

742
00:37:38,396 --> 00:37:41,936
I want to be with my wife.

743
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:44,507
I love you.

744
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,828
And I'm sorry.

745
00:37:59,658 --> 00:38:02,418
I am so.. Sorry.

746
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:09,367
It's tragic.

747
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:12,927
Three peoples lives destroyed because they
couldn't accept who they really were.

748
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:16,767
A notion that some magic pill
could take away all that pain.

749
00:38:16,768 --> 00:38:18,669
Must have been pretty tempting.

750
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,088
There are pills you can
take Daniel, you know that.

751
00:38:21,089 --> 00:38:23,634
Ain't no pill gonna cure my ill.

752
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,124
It would probably help with your symptoms.

753
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,743
Maybe my symptoms make me who I am.

754
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:32,539
That's a cop out.
You know you should be on meds.

755
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,792
Let's go Doc, you're late.

756
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:37,653
Ugh.

757
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,425
You think I should go?

758
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:42,757
Stop avoiding this conversation.

759
00:38:42,758 --> 00:38:47,978
Okay either you put it on,
or I stuff you in it.

760
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:52,722
You heard the man.

761
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:13,704
Daniel.

762
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:17,168
Kate please tell me
you've got another case.

763
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:18,471
And you're getting me the hell out of here.

764
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:20,877
- I wouldn't say..
- So sorry.

765
00:39:20,878 --> 00:39:23,119
Hi Daniel. I had some trouble
finding a parking spot.

766
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,340
Allow me.

767
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:29,964
You look beautiful.

768
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:32,605
Well thank you.

769
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,956
You clean up pretty well yourself.

770
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,749
Ha. Well..

771
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,454
We were going to grab a drink.
Care to join us?

772
00:39:39,455 --> 00:39:42,227
No, I think I am..

773
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:43,611
Gala-ed out tonight.

774
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:46,633
Right, well some other time then.

775
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,794
Mm-hm.

776
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:51,724
See ya Daniel.

777
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:53,677
Daniel. There you are come on.

778
00:39:53,678 --> 00:39:55,693
- No Paul.
- No, no, no come on.

779
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:57,261
- Don't make me..
- Shes a big fan.

780
00:39:57,262 --> 00:40:02,662
No I just want to introduce
you to Allison Bannister.

781
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:11,031
Wow you are not old.

782
00:40:12,212 --> 00:40:16,311
Well you are quite the
observational scientist.

783
00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:21,218
Mrs. Bannister I'm told that I can be uh,
overly blunt so uh, forgive me in advance.

784
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,677
When I say that I am only here tonight.

785
00:40:23,678 --> 00:40:27,174
Because I'm interested in procuring sex.

786
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,058
I mean money.

787
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,699
For a donation.

788
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:36,671
Who knows.. If you play your
cards right Dr. Pierce..

789
00:40:36,672 --> 00:40:39,972
You might just get both.

790
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,722
Wow.

791
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:48,363
Nice work, huh?

792
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:52,464
Is there something wrong with me?

793
00:40:52,465 --> 00:40:54,960
It's a question we all ask ourselves.

794
00:40:54,961 --> 00:41:00,861
We all wonder why we don't look like,
act like, feel like everybody else.

795
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:04,090
Each of our brains has
the exact same parts.

796
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:08,112
The Cortex, Hypothalamus,
Fornix, Septal Nucleus so on..

797
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:10,147
And yet..

798
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:13,988
No two brains are exactly alike.

799
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:17,667
So being different..

800
00:41:22,872 --> 00:41:25,392
Being unique..

801
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:32,385
Is undeniably a fundamental characteristic.

802
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:36,728
Of being human.
