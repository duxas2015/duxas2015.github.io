00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,271
THE SENATOR DIED
OF NATURAL CAUSES.

689
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:42,877
THEY NEED TO CHECK AGAIN.

690
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,039
THIS MORNING, YOU WERE ACCUSING
RYLAND AND HIS AIDES

691
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,407
OF SOME HOMICIDAL CONSPIRACY
TO PUT HIM IN OFFICE.

692
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:48,976
NOW, IF THAT WAS TRUE,

693
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,045
WHY WOULD SOMEONE TURN AROUND
AND TRY TO KILL HIM?

694
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,453
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST -- SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

695
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,988
DOC...

696
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:01,385
MAYBE YOU NEED TO GO BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

697
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,472
YOU'RE RIGHT, MAX.

698
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,139
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED TO DO.

699
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:15,011
DR. NEWSOME.

700
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,911
I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO COME BACK.

701
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:18,043
YEAH.
I-I'M NOT CHECKING IN.

702
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,207
I NEED YOU TO BE NATALIE
FOR A WHILE.

703
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,205
HAVE YOU TAKEN
YOUR MEDS TODAY?

704
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:23,347
YES, I'M TAKING YOUR [BLEEP]
MEDS, WHICH IS IRONIC,

705
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,952
BECAUSE IF I WASN'T
TAKING THEM,

706
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,554
I WOULDN'T BE BACK
IN THE LOONEY BIN.

707
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:27,615
YOU'RE NOT MAKING
ANY SENSE.

708
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,093
I'M MAKING PERFECT SENSE.

709
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,491
I HAVE A PUZZLE
THAT I CAN'T SOLVE.

710
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,662
NOW, NORMALLY, I WOULD WORK IT
OUT WITH NATALIE,

711
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,561
BUT SHE'S GONE,
SO I NEED YOU TO BE HER.

712
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:36,503
I'M YOUR DOCTOR.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S ADVISABLE.

713
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:37,558
PLEASE!

714
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:42,227
I NEED TO KNOW THAT
MY [BLEEP] BRAIN STILL WORKS,

715
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,668
EVEN WHEN I'M ON THE MEDS.

716
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:48,272
OTHERWISE, I DON'T --
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THIS.

717
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:54,147
THE C.E.O. OF VERTERON
WANTED RYLAND IN,

718
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,120
SO THEY MANIPULATED THE AVIONICS
TO CRASH PAULSON'S PLANE,

719
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,478
THEN, TO TIE UP LOOSE ENDS,

720
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,516
THEY GOT RID OF A REPORTER
AND AN ENGINEER

721
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,191
WHO WERE ONTO THE PLOT.

722
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,090
THEN THE GOVERNOR DECIDES
HE'S GOING TO APPOINT

723
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:04,422
THE SENATOR'S WIDOW,

724
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,416
SO THEY BLACKMAIL HER
INTO DROPPING OUT,

725
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:06,557
THEY GET RYLAND ELECTED.

726
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:07,692
THE ONE THING
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT

727
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,556
IS WHY THEY KILLED RYLAND

728
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,255
WHEN THEY'VE GONE TO ALL THIS
TROUBLE TO PUT HIM IN OFFICE.

729
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,497
THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE KIND
OF PARANOID CONSPIRACY THEORY

730
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,602
THAT LANDED YOU IN THE HOSPITAL
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

731
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,544
BUT I'M NOT DELUSIONAL NOW.

732
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,069
THEN SIMPLIFY
YOUR THINKING.

733
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,335
YOU WENT TO MED SCHOOL.
YOU KNOW OCCAM'S RAZOR.

734
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,172
WHEN FACED
WITH COMPETING HYPOTHESES,

735
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,108
CHOOSE THE ONE THAT MAKES THE
FEWEST NEW ASSUMPTIONS. SO WHAT?

736
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,154
SO YOU'RE MAKING A LOT
OF ASSUMPTIONS

737
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,249
FOR WHICH
YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE.

738
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,021
WHAT DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE
WITH YOUR OWN EYES?

739
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,220
SENATOR RYLAND, A MAN
WITH NO HISTORY OF CLOTTING,

740
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:34,992
SIT HAPPENS..

741
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:36,661
YEAH, BUT SOMETHING IS TELLING
ME IT WASN'T ACCIDENTAL.

742
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,988
A VOICE IN YOUR HEARD?

743
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:39,334
NO, NOT A VOICE --

744
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:44,033
NOT IN MY HEAD --
HIS VOICE.

745
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:45,403
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

746
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,571
RYLAND --
HE SAID HE COULDN'T EAT SALMON.

747
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,069
WELL, SOME PEOPLE
CAN'T EAT SALMON

748
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,441
BECAUSE OF ADVERSE
DRUG REACTIONS.

749
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,139
YES!

750
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,711
[ SNAPS FINGERS ] YES!
THAT'S GOOD. PEOPLE ON COUMADIN.

751
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:57,179
AND COUMADIN'S A BLOOD THINNER
USED TO PREVENT STROKES.

752
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,649
YOU SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE
A HISTORY OF CLOTTING.

753
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,608
JOHN KENNEDY COVERED UP
HIS ADDISON'S DISEASE.

754
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,677
RYLAND CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT
THE VOTERS KNOWING

755
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,515
THAT HE HAD
A LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION.

756
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:06,651
ANOTHER ASSUMPTION.

757
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,155
WOULD YOU GO
WITH ME ON THIS?

758
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,518
OKAY, FINE. RYLAND WAS
SECRETLY USING COUMADIN.

759
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,557
THEN HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE STROKED.

760
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,532
HE WOULDN'T BE THE
FIRST PATIENT TO GO OFF
HIS MEDS, WOULD HE?

761
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,061
IF HE WENT OFF HIS MEDS,
WHY WAS HE AVOIDING SALMON?

762
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:22,498
MAYBE HE DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS OFF HIS MEDS.

763
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,374
MAYBE SOMEBODY
SWITCHED THEM OUT.

764
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:26,073
HE'D BE A TICKING
TIME BOMB.

765
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,205
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

766
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,769
YOU KNOW,

767
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,207
YOU'RE NOT AS GOOD
AT THIS AS NATALIE...

768
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:34,053
BUT YOU ARE NOT HALF BAD.

769
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:39,815
Woman:
SOURCES CLOSE TO THE GOVERNOR
SAY HE INTENDS TO APPOINTMENT

770
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,591
VICTORIA RYLAND TO SERVE OUT
HER LATE HUSBAND'S TERM.

771
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,361
YOU SEE? I'M RIGHT.
I'M RIGHT!

772
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,630
SHE KILLED HER HUSBAND
TO GET HIS SENATE SEAT!

773
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,088
HOW COULD SHE EVEN BE SURE

774
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,097
THAT THEY GOVERNOR
WOULD APPOINT HER?

775
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,499
HE WAS GONNA APPOINT PAULSON'S
WIDOW WHEN HE DIED.

776
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,271
IT'S A LONG-STANDING
TRADITION.

777
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,740
OF THE 200 WOMEN THAT HAVE
EVER SERVED IN CONGRESS,

778
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,268
OVER 40 WERE
CONGRESSMEN'S WIDOWS.

779
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:00,244
DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN.

780
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,542
I SEE IT NOW.

781
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:03,083
THIS WASN'T SOME --
SOME GRAND CONSPIRACY

782
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:04,639
TO MURDER PAULSON
AND RIG THE ELECTION.

783
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,476
THIS WAS THE WORK
OF ONE VERY CLEVER,

784
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,552
VERY AMBITIOUS WOMAN.

785
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,353
WHAT?

786
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,685
I JUST TALKED TO MY FRIEND
IN I.T.B.

787
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:18,261
SHE RAN A DISCREET CREDIT CHECK
ON VICTORIA RYLAND.

788
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,430
TURNS OUT SHE HAD THE FRONT
OF HER CAR REPAIRED

789
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,659
THE DAY AFTER THE REPORTER
WAS RUN OFF THE ROAD.

790
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:24,264
THAT'S -- THAT'S PROOF.
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO DEPRESSED?

791
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,396
BECAUSE IT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

792
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:26,801
GET A WARRANT.
GET A WARRANT.

793
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:28,402
YOU WILL FIND
THAT THE RYLANDS

794
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:30,144
WERE BUYING COUMADIN
FROM MEXICO,

795
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,469
AND -- AND THAT LITTLE
PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE YOU FIND

796
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:34,144
WILL BE FILLED
WITH FAKE PILLS.

797
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:36,113
NO JUDGE IS GONNA GIVE ME
A FISHING LICENSE

798
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:38,212
TO GO AFTER A WOMAN
WHO'S ABOUT TO BE A SENATOR.

799
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,414
YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A
WOMAN WHO MURDERED HER HUSBAND

800
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:42,176
TO GET A SEAT IN
THE UNITED STATES SENATE,

801
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:43,424
AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO
ABOUT IT?

802
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,119
I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT.

803
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:48,121
DANIEL, JUST PROMISE ME YOU'RE
NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING CRAZY.

804
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:50,624
[ SIGHS ]

805
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:01,425
I'D LIKE SPEAK
TO MRS. RYLAND, PLEASE.

806
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:03,137
YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT.

807
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:04,569
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL
THE SENATOR IN WAITING

808
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,443
THAT IF SHE CARES AT ALL
ABOUT HER POLITICAL FUTURE,

809
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:07,872
SHE'LL SEE ME NOW?

810
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,706
IT'S ALL RIGHT, JOHN.

811
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,341
SHOW DR. PIERCE
TO MY STUDY.

812
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,586
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR HUSBAND'S DEATH.

813
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,688
THANK YOU.

814
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,749
BUT I KNOW
YOU KILLED HIM.

815
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,332
YOU WENT TO SENATOR PAULSON'S
OFFICE TO SEDUCE HIM.

816
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,329
WHEN HE RESPONDED, YOU ACTED
LIKE YOU WERE BEING RAPED.

817
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,402
WE ASSUMED IT WAS
SECURITY FOOTAGE,

818
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,601
BUT I'M BETTING YOU TAPED
THE WHOLE THING

819
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,203
ON YOUR CELLPHONE.

820
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,895
YOU WERE PROBABLY INTENDING
TO BLACKMAIL THE SENATOR

821
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,506
INTO NOT RUNNING
FOR RE-ELECTION,

822
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:42,168
BUT WHEN HIS PLANE CRASHED,
YOU SAW AN OPPORTUNITY.

823
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,738
YOU BLACKMAILED HIS WIFE INSTEAD
SO YOUR HUSBAND COULD RUN.

824
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,877
WHEN SOME REPORTER
STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS,

825
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,223
YOU RAN HIM OFF THE ROAD.

826
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50,778
THEN, ONCE YOUR HUSBAND
GOT ELECTED,

827
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,746
YOU SWITCHED HIS COUMADIN
WITH SUGAR PILLS

828
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,524
AND WAITED FOR HIM
TO STROKE OUT.

829
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:57,193
IF I WASN'T IN MOURNING,
I MIGHT EVEN FIND THAT FUNNY.

830
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:59,563
THE FBI FOUND
YOUR CAR-REPAIR BILL.

831
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:01,591
AND IF THAT WERE EVIDENCE
OF A CRIME,

832
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,497
THE FBI WOULD BE HERE --
NOT YOU.

833
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:06,669
[ LAUGHS ] YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE.

834
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,898
EVERYBODY AT THE FBI THINKS
I'M CRAZY, WHICH I AM.

835
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,644
AND THEY WOULDN'T TOUCH
THIS ANYWAY.

836
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,569
IT'S A POLITICAL
MINE FIELD.

837
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,374
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

838
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,277
BECAUSE I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO SEND YOU TO PRISON,

839
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,609
BUT I CAN [BLEEP] WELL
STOP A MURDERER

840
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:19,614
FROM BECOMING A SENATOR.

841
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:20,845
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

842
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,909
UNLESS YOU CALL
A PRESS CONFERENCE

843
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,518
ANNOUNCING YOUR INTENTION

844
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,820
TO TURN DOWN
THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENT,

845
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,622
I'M GONNA GO TO THE STAR-HERALD
WITH MY OWN STORY.

846
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:30,985
"DR. DANIEL PIERCE

847
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,262
"IS RESIGNING HIS CONSULTING
