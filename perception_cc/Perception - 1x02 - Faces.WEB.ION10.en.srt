844
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:34,719
BUT SOON WE NOTICE
SOMETHING STRANGE.

845
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,763
MY HUSBAND SOMETIMES --
HE THINK PAULINA IS ME.

846
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:53,735
WHEN NEXT TIME SHE COME
TO VISIT, HE NOT RECOGNIZE HER,

847
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,072
EVEN THOUGH HE KNOW HER.

848
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,736
THAT'S WHEN SHE REALIZED
HE WAS FACE-BLIND.

849
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,906
AND SHE MAKE PLAN
TO GET HIS MONEY.

850
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:04,075
BUT FIRST SHE NEED NEW NAME
SO HE DOESN'T GET SUSPICIOUS.

851
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:08,945
SO SHE STEAL WALLET AT MALL,

852
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:12,857
AND SHE MAKE HERSELF LOOK LIKE
WOMAN ON DRIVING LICENSE.

853
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:18,125
HE'S NOT USED TO BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
PAYING ATTENTION TO HIM,

854
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:24,043
SO HE GIVE HER MONEY, JEWELS,
ANYTHING SHE WANT.

855
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:25,939
FOR ME, IT GET WORSE.

856
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,912
I WANT TO RUN AWAY.

857
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,980
BUT PAULINA SAY WE HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL WE GET ALL FRANK'S MONEY

858
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:36,781
AND THAT SHE HAVE NEW PLAN
TO PROTECT ME.

859
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:41,845
I GIVE HER HAIRCUT, AND I GIVE
HER MY CLOTHES AND MY PERFUME.

860
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:46,124
PAULINA IS STRONGER THAN ME.

861
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,887
SHE MAKE FRANK
STOP HITTING HER...

862
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:53,965
...AND SHE CONVINCE FRANK
TO HIRE UKRAINIAN MAID

863
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,929
TO KEEP HER COMPANY.

864
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:59,967
SO PAULINA
BECAME YOU AND JOLENE,

865
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,835
AND YOU BECAME THE MAID.

866
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,113
IT'S AN INGENIOUS PLAN.

867
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,841
YOU ARE
GOING TO ARREST ME.

868
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:08,152
YOU'RE AN ACCESSORY
TO FRAUD.

869
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,819
THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
MIGHT WANT TO CHARGE YOU,

870
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,819
BUT I'LL DO MY BEST
TO CONVINCE THEM

871
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,091
THAT BEING MARRIED
TO AN ABUSIVE, CHEATING MURDERER

872
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,020
WAS PROBABLY
PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

873
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,858
THANK YOU.

874
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:25,133
BUT MY HUSBAND WILL FIND OUT
WHAT WE DID TO HIM,

875
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:27,873
AND WHEN HE LEAVE PRISON,
HE WILL FIND ME,

876
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:28,829
AND WITHOUT PAULINA --

877
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,037
YOU WERE THREATENED

878
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,168
BY A KNOWN ASSOCIATE
OF THE TUPELOV ORGANIZATION.

879
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,973
I CAN MAKE
A PRETTY GOOD CASE

880
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,905
THAT YOU BELONG
IN WITNESS PROTECTION.

881
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:39,041
YOU'LL GET A FRESH START, OLENA.
NEW NAME, NEW LIFE.

882
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,853
Paul: DANIEL!

883
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,852
PAUL, LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

884
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:46,924
UPSET? NO, NO, NO.

885
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:49,052
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU SAID TO HATHAWAY,

886
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,887
BUT SUDDENLY
HE IS IN LOVE WITH THIS TOWN.

887
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:54,933
HE'S TAKING THE JOB.
YOU DID GOOD, BUDDY.

888
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,870
Daniel: WALT WHITMAN WROTE,
"I CONTAIN MULTITUDES."

889
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,998
TURNS OUT HE WAS MORE RIGHT
THAN HE KNEW.

890
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,903
THE SELF IS REALLY A COLLECTION

891
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:06,035
OF SEVERAL
DISTINCT NEURAL NETWORKS,

892
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:09,011
ALL RUNNING ON THIS GLOB
OF JELLY BETWEEN OUR EARS.

893
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,880
SO, IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT
VERSIONS OF YOURSELF

894
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,050
FLOATING AROUND
INSIDE YOUR SKULL,

895
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,249
WHICH ONE IS THE REAL YOU?

896
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:23,049
ARE YOU THE LEAD GUITARIST,
ROCKING OUT ONCE A WEEK?

897
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,088
OR IS IT YOUR 9:00-TO-5:00

898
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:29,134
THAT TRULY DEFINES YOU?

899
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:34,299
CAN ONE OF THOSE SELVES
BE A DEVOTED SPOUSE...

900
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:41,067
...AND THE OTHER A LYING,
THIEVING, OUT-OF-CONTROL ADDICT?

901
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,936
CAN YOU LONG FOR LOVE

902
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,984
AND YET STILL BE CURSED
BY GENETICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT

903
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:50,921
AND REMAIN THE SAME SON
OF A [BLEEP] YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN?

904
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,019
AND EVEN IF YOU DO CHANGE
SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF...

905
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,964
...YOUR FACE...

906
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,190
YOUR NAME...

907
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:04,126
WHERE YOU LIVE...

908
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:27,317
...CAN YOU EVER ACTUALLY CHANGE
WHO YOU REALLY ARE?
