1
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:16,315
What is reality?

2
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:18,020
Hippie guy.

3
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:18,984
The observable universe?

4
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,067
I suppose that answer might fly
in the physics department,

5
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:22,564
but this is neuroscience.

6
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:26,443
Who's got the brains to give me
an answer relating to the brain?

7
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:27,775
Ironic t-shirt.

8
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:31,842
Reality is exactly
what we see and hear,

9
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:34,713
instead of what we fantasize
about or dream

10
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:37,088
or, you know,
maybe hallucinate.

11
00:00:37,123 --> 00:00:39,690
Ah. Hallucination.

12
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:42,760
That's an answer I would have
expected from hippie guy.

13
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:47,096
Sex, drugs,
and rock 'n' roll, right?

14
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,200
Okay. Now, here's something
that's really

15
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:50,601
gonna alter your consciousness.

16
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:53,498
Reality...

17
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:56,134
Is a figment
of your imagination.

18
00:00:56,168 --> 00:01:01,174
Who here hasn't woken up
breathless from a nightmare

19
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,777
and thought, "oh,
thank God it's just a dream"?

20
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:07,077
That's because
the neurochemical impulses

21
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:10,316
fired when we're dreaming
or fantasizing

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,452
or hallucinating
are indistinguishable

23
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:15,720
from the ones banging around
inside our skulls

24
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:17,849
when we actually experience
those events.

25
00:01:17,883 --> 00:01:20,616
So...

26
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:26,011
If what we perceive
is often wrong...

27
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:30,814
How can we ever know what's real
and what isn't?

28
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:36,920
All right.
Faculty meeting's at noon.

29
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:38,288
Rosenthal's at 2:00,

30
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:40,921
so I picked you up one of
the veggie wraps that you like.

31
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:42,855
You can scarf it down
in between.

32
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,189
You know how you get
when you don't eat.

33
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:45,457
Lewicki.
Yeah?

34
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:46,558
Room and board in exchange
for some light housekeeping

35
00:01:46,592 --> 00:01:47,758
does not make you my mother.

36
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:49,326
Just trying to look out
for you, doc.

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,493
Do you have my puzzles?

38
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,794
<i>Yeah. Times, chronicle, trib,
daily mail...</i>

39
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:54,061
Professor Pierce?

40
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:56,123
I was wondering
if I could buy you a latte.

41
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,158
Uh, I don't drink coffee.

42
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:02,161
Oh, it doesn't
have to be coffee.

43
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:04,797
I just wanted to pick your brain
about my term-paper topic.

44
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:07,633
Oh.
Here's the thing, miss...

45
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:09,702
Karyn.
Karyn. Uh...

46
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:12,504
"Discussing your term paper"
is obviously code for sex.

47
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:15,674
And... and while we might both
enjoy that very much,

48
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,477
it could also get me fired,

49
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,812
so I'm afraid
I have to regretfully

50
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,483
and respectfully
decline your offer.

51
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,175
Daniel.

52
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:48,512
Daniel.

53
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:52,383
Kate Moretti.

54
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:55,753
You'd be a lot easier to find
if you carried a cellphone.

55
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:57,555
If I carried a cellphone,
the government could track me.

56
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,658
I am the government.
My point exactly.

57
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,895
I thought you were at Quantico.

58
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:04,196
Got my old desk back.

59
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:05,665
Isn't that a demotion?

60
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:08,834
Got a few minutes?

61
00:03:09,078 --> 00:03:10,545
His name's Clark Weilman.

62
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:11,746
<i>He's... well, he was</i>

63
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:14,182
general counsel
of techsan pharmaceuticals.

64
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:16,151
Skull was fractured
in six places,

65
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:18,253
and his wife confessed
to detectives

66
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:19,388
from Chicago homicide.

67
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:20,523
Police have a confession.

68
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:22,559
Why am I looking
at these pretty pictures?

69
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,327
Wife makes Nicole Richie
look fat.

70
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:25,829
I don't know who that is.

71
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:29,533
I- I think the wife has anorexia
or bulimia. I don't know.

72
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:31,502
Either way,
she could not lift this trophy,

73
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:34,072
let alone bash her husband
over the head with it six times.

74
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:35,707
You think the confession
was coerced?

75
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:36,774
She has a vacant affect.

76
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,675
If she does have
an eating disorder,

77
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,478
it could be a symptom of a much
more serious mental illness.

78
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,715
You were always
one of my best students.

79
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:49,853
W- why is the FBI involved
in this anyway?

80
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,723
A couple of months ago,
techsan informed the bureau

81
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:56,126
that some of its top executives
were receiving death threats,

82
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,295
calling the pharmaceutical
industry

83
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,597
part of a vast
public/private conspiracy

84
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,432
to poison the American people.

85
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,535
<i>Can't argue with that.</i>

86
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:10,708
S.A.I.C. Says you gave up
the consulting gig.

87
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:12,208
Any particular reason?

88
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:14,175
Oh, uh...

89
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,876
After you left,
the fun went out of it.

90
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:17,978
Well, I'm back.

91
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,147
<i>Why did you kill your husband,
Mrs. Weilman?</i>

92
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:29,682
<i>I, uh...</i>

93
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:34,084
don't know.

94
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:39,887
You told the police you wanted
the insurance money.

95
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:43,424
Yes. That's... that's right,
the insurance money.

96
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,393
And just what is
the point of this?

97
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:49,829
<i>When did you and your husband
buy this policy?</i>

98
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:52,727
I don't remember.

99
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:56,398
Was it last Thursday?

100
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:58,566
You met your husband for lunch,

101
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:01,636
and then you both went to
the insurance-company offices

102
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:02,971
and signed the papers?

103
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:08,710
Yeah. That's right.
It was... Yeah.

104
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:12,714
Two days ago,
when you went for a walk,

105
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:15,186
did you find a stray kitten?

106
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,055
You took her home?
You called her Millie?

107
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:26,167
How did you know about Millie?

108
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,563
She's innocent.

109
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,131
What are you talking about?
She signed a confession.

110
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:42,044
Korsa-what?
It's a neurological disorder

111
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:44,213
characterized
by anterograde amnesia,

112
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:46,883
extreme susceptibility to
suggestion, and confabulation.

113
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:48,151
I tell her she has a cat
named Millie,

114
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,520
she remembers
having a cat named Millie.

115
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:51,655
You tell her she bashed
her husband over the head

116
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,524
with a golf trophy,
and she remembers that.

117
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,528
Only there is no cat.
I made that up.

118
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:56,864
Just like you made up a story

119
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,700
about a murder plot
to collect life insurance,

120
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,202
which is a bit of a clichÃ©,
isn't it, detective?

121
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:04,973
What the hell?
Hey, hold on a second!

122
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:06,241
Hey! Hey!

123
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:07,942
Listen,
we did a background check.

124
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:10,779
We found out about that policy,
and we asked her.

125
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:12,448
You're acting like I beat it out
of her with a rubber hose.

126
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:13,816
Either way,
it's a false confession.

127
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,450
She doesn't belong in jail.
She belongs in a hospital.

128
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,552
This is bullshit.

129
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,687
Can we go now?

130
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:21,923
Just give me a minute.
Okay?

131
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,525
I'm gonna recommend that
Ms. Weilman be transferred

132
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,927
to a psychiatric unit
for further evaluation.

133
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:29,964
Are you kidding me?!
She confessed to murder.

134
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,368
Look, if Dr. Pierce...

135
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:41,209
My lieutenant warned me
about you,

136
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:43,044
said you'd come in here,
flashing your FBI badge,

137
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:44,945
jacking our cases.

138
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,380
Screwing with one of mine now

139
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:48,415
because some nutjob
makes a drive-by diagnosis?

140
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,784
He's not a nutjob,
detective Hammond.

141
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,987
He literally wrote the book
on forensic neuropsychiatry...

142
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:55,322
four of them, actually.

143
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:57,958
Not a nutjob, huh?

144
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,565
Okay. So he's
a little eccentric.

145
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,769
to get the FBI's interest?

146
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:22,779
You'll have to forgive Alan,
Agent Moretti.

147
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:24,256
He and Clark were very close.

148
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:26,061
I just need access
to all litigation

149
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:28,088
filed against techsan
over the past five years.

150
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:30,057
Do you have any idea
how many frivolous claims

151
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,825
a company like ours
has to deal with?

152
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,461
Mm. I can imagine.

153
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,930
But we may be able to connect
the death threats

154
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:38,466
techsan received to someone
who brought a lawsuit

155
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,768
against the company.

156
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:42,604
And I would also like access
to Mr. Weilman's e-mail account

157
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:45,140
and a list of his current
and former colleagues...

158
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,176
really, anyone he came
into contact with.

159
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,478
Alan will get you everything
you need.

160
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,985
Thanks, Alan.

161
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,996
These are the anonymous e-mails
sent to Clark Weilman

162
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,731
and the other
techsan executives.

163
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:05,001
These death threats were routed
through servers

164
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,135
all over the world.

165
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,138
Whoever sent them knows
how to cover his tracks.

166
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,206
Anything you can tell us
about the psychology

167
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,841
of the letter writer
would help.

168
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:14,377
"Pharmaceutical industry
and the fda

169
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,947
are conspiring to keep
the American people sick. "

170
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:19,016
Well, that part's
certainly true.

171
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,017
Is he serious?

172
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:21,285
Restless leg syndrome?

173
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,620
You don't think
that's an invention

174
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:24,189
of the drug companies
to sell more pills?

175
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:29,026
"You scum need
a hearty reminder. "

176
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:31,028
That's repeated in each
of the e-mails.

177
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:32,664
You think it means something?

178
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:34,666
"You scum need
a hearty reminder. "

179
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:52,984
"Techsan... "

180
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:58,723
"... murdered... Irene may. "

181
00:08:58,757 --> 00:09:00,091
It's an anagram.

182
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:03,928
Some domestic terrorist
goes to all this trouble

183
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,763
to disguise the source
of his e-mails,

184
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:07,999
and then he just
gives us a name?

185
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:09,567
He's trying to prove
he's smarter than we are.

186
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:11,202
Very good, Agent Moretti.

187
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:14,305
"May v. Techsan,
dismissed in summary judgment,

188
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,675
filed by a Timothy may on behalf
of his mother, Irene. "

189
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:24,848
Wait here.

190
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:28,251
Once it's clear, you can
come up, take a look around.

191
00:09:30,223 --> 00:09:34,627
FBI! We'd like to talk
to you!

192
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:38,931
Open it.

193
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:04,224
Mr. may?

194
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:17,805
FBI! Stop!
Stairs!

195
00:10:24,112 --> 00:10:26,413
Freeze, Mr. may!

196
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:39,827
Are you all right?!

197
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:41,028
Fine.

198
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:42,597
You want
my professional opinion,

199
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:44,465
jumping off
a second-story fire escape

200
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:46,033
is what we commonly
call "crazy. "

201
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:49,271
Guess that makes two of us.

202
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:58,689
It's against the law to make
terrorist threats.

203
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:00,624
And murder is kind of
a no-no, too.

204
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:01,859
I didn't kill anyone.

205
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:03,460
Then I will ask
you again...

206
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,763
where were you the night
that Clark Weilman died?

207
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:08,365
You think I'm gonna cooperate
with the beast better known

208
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,234
as the United States
federal government?

209
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,836
Herbal tea.
What?

210
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,371
No milk, no sugar.

211
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,777
No sugar?

212
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,220
Processed sugar...

213
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,725
that's an addictive drug
peddled by big agribusiness

214
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,894
to promote an epidemic
in type 2 diabetes.

215
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,631
<i>And then their pals
in big pharma</i>

216
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,833
<i>can reap billions
marketing treatments.</i>

217
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,802
And don't even get me started

218
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,038
on why they put hormones
in milk.

219
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,509
I- I'm not a fed,
by the way.

220
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,677
Then what are you doing here?

221
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,613
College Professor.

222
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:58,449
Sometimes they ask
for my expert opinion.

223
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:02,319
And I-I bill the beast for my...
for my time, believe me.

224
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,156
<i>Figure as long as they're
gonna bleed me with taxes,</i>

225
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,258
<i>might as well get something
out of it, right?</i>

226
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,966
Your mother had type 2 diabetes,
didn't she?

227
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:20,172
She was always sending me out
to pick her up soda, ice cream.

228
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,744
I should have told her no.

229
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:29,014
Well, she was your mom.
You wanted to make her happy.

230
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:32,184
And you...
you wanted to help her.

231
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,785
That's why you signed her up
for a drug trial.

232
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:34,719
Is that right?

233
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,989
Techsan's new miracle pill,
insulprin?

234
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:41,426
They said it would cure her.

235
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,461
Instead, she drops dead
of a heart attack.

236
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:44,796
You think the drug killed her?

237
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,464
It's poison.

238
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,236
And the big-shot lawyers
at techsan

239
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,570
have your suit thrown out.

240
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,305
They said it was frivolous.

241
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,210
Bastards wouldn't even pay
for the funeral.

242
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,178
That must have made you
pretty angry.

243
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,348
You got no idea.

244
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,885
Angry enough
to kill Clark Weilman?

245
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,122
Look at me, mister.

246
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:18,430
You really think I got it in me
to cave some guy's head in?

247
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,940
Drop you back at campus.
What about the case?

248
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,742
You helped us solve it.
Thank you.

249
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,344
You don't really believe
that poor guy killed anybody?

250
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,680
No. He's paranoid.
He's not violent. I agree.

251
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:35,881
And we have
no physical evidence

252
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,116
connecting him
to the crime scene.

253
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,551
W- wait... I'm told I can be
a little absentminded,

254
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,453
so maybe I'm missing
something here.

255
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,889
We were assigned to investigate
terrorist threats.

256
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,824
We have the man who made
those threats in custody.

257
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,292
But there was a murder!

258
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,493
Local police matter.

259
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,661
Oh, come on.

260
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,629
You dangle a puzzle like this
in front of me,

261
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,265
and you expect me to drop it
before it's solved?

262
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,101
Listen...

263
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,838
You were right, okay?

264
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,740
<i>My transfer back to Chicago
was a demotion.</i>

265
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,375
What'd you do?

266
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,844
Leap off one too many
tall buildings

267
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,145
in pursuit of fleeing suspects?

268
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,182
The deputy director said
that I had a tendency

269
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,619
to go beyond the scope of
my assigned investigations.

270
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,523
Well, you can try to be
a good little bureaucrat

271
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:17,891
and deny your impulses,

272
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,260
but you know you're just
as incapable

273
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,329
of letting this go as I am.

274
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,549
Thank you for seeing us,
Dr. Bryant.

275
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:28,093
I don't know how much help
I can be.

276
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:29,361
I- I didn't know
Clark well.

277
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:31,864
Lawyers don't mix much
with lab rats.

278
00:14:31,898 --> 00:14:33,833
Well, we've been talking
to everyone.

279
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:35,434
Mr. Weilman
had contact with...

280
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:37,102
uh, friends, associates
here at techsan.

281
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:39,912
Does your new blockbuster drug,
insulprin, cause heart attacks?

282
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:41,317
How is that relevant?

283
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:45,188
Uh, no, that's okay.
I'm happy to answer that.

284
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:46,255
Insulprin...

285
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,325
Has been rigorously tested
for five years.

286
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,493
Subjects taking the drug

287
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:52,628
are certainly no more likely
to have heart attacks

288
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:53,595
than the control group.

289
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,564
We're very proud
of insulprin here.

290
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:57,433
It's gonna save a lot of lives.

291
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,635
And earn billions of dollars.

292
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,704
W- what does any of this have to
do with Clark Weilman's murder?

293
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:03,673
There was a lawsuit
filed against this company

294
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,741
by a man claiming
his mother's coronary

295
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:07,643
was caused by insulprin,
maybe techsan.

296
00:15:07,677 --> 00:15:09,311
Yeah.
I remember that suit.

297
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:11,146
It was dismissed in summary judgment.

298
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:12,781
Something funny?

299
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:15,217
Sad, actually.

300
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:18,387
Um, I remember it, too,
because it turns out

301
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:20,656
this may woman
was in the placebo group.

302
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,758
She wasn't even taking
the drug.

303
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:25,093
That answer your question?

304
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:34,569
Daniel?

305
00:15:34,604 --> 00:15:37,039
Are we done here?
Daniel, are you okay?

306
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:39,408
Hmm.

307
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:41,611
Well, I appreciate your maybe
not-so-healthy distrust

308
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:42,979
of large institutions,

309
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:45,048
but how about we just put aside
your conspiracy theories

310
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:46,582
and focus on finding
the killer?

311
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:48,851
I'm looking
for a Valerie Nelson!

312
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:49,919
Hammond?

313
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:51,721
I'm Valerie Nelson.

314
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:53,924
Oh. I'd like to have a word
with you.

315
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,125
What's this all about?

316
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,093
Well, it seems
that Pamela Weilman

317
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:59,429
had another motive
for killing her husband.

318
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:00,797
According to his phone records,

319
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:03,399
he was making a lot
of late-night calls

320
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,067
to a pretty, young coworker.

321
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:14,044
<i>I knew it was wrong, but...</i>

322
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:16,713
<i>I fell in love with him.</i>

323
00:16:16,747 --> 00:16:18,917
<i>So, where were you
on the night of march 5th?</i>

324
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,591
<i>Home...
Waiting for Clark to call.</i>

325
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:27,038
<i>It was the night he was gonna
tell Pamela he was leaving.</i>

326
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:31,376
<i>I guess
she didn't take it so well.</i>

327
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,346
One of the wife's symptoms
is anterograde amnesia, right?

328
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:37,715
Mm.
So her husband comes home,

329
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,584
tells her that he's leaving her

330
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:41,586
for some hottie
from the office.

331
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,922
She goes into
an adrenaline-fueled rage,

332
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:44,889
and she kills him.

333
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:46,892
But, because
of the korsakoff's,

334
00:16:46,926 --> 00:16:48,794
by the time the police
get there,

335
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:51,029
she's forgotten why
she killed the guy.

336
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:52,230
And when the detective says
she did it

337
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:53,431
for the insurance money...

338
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:56,034
that's how she remembers it.
Impressive theory.

339
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,137
But wrong.

340
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:02,273
Pamela Weilman isn't a killer.
She's a victim.

341
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:03,908
First, her husband
cheats on her,

342
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:06,444
and then this neanderthal cop
tries to put her in jail...

343
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,780
which is typical of how
the mentally ill are treated

344
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:10,548
by our so-called
justice system.

345
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:14,252
Well, I'm stuck.

346
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:16,621
And the only thing
that I know of

347
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:19,892
that's going to get me unstuck
is burger grease.

348
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:21,660
You know cholesterol
is the silent killer?

349
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:23,695
You'll have a garden burger.
I'll buy it for you.

350
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:27,066
Let's go.
No.

351
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,901
No, I-I can't.

352
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:31,439
I have... I have an appointment.

353
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:32,606
So, why didn't you say yes?

354
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,574
<i>Because I had a date with you.</i>

355
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:37,544
Daniel, we haven't had a date
since grad school.

356
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:38,946
It's time to move on.

357
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,282
Admit it.
I'm wearing you down.

358
00:17:41,316 --> 00:17:42,716
I'm wearing you down.

359
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:43,984
How do you feel?

360
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:48,989
<i>I'm fine. Why?</i>

361
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,558
And we both know how you get

362
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:52,626
when you don't stick
to your routine.

363
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,529
Which is why I have Lewicki.
He keeps me organized.

364
00:17:55,563 --> 00:17:58,498
What are you gonna do
when he graduates?

365
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:00,333
You know...

366
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,935
you know how often Lewicki
changes majors?

367
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:05,671
I don't think there's
much danger of graduation.

368
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:07,806
<i>Fly ball to right.
Well-hit.</i>

369
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,976
<i>Back near the wall...
And... Gone!</i>

370
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,410
<i>Yes!
Into the basket!</i>

371
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:14,212
You see that?

372
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:15,213
It's spring training.

373
00:18:15,248 --> 00:18:17,015
Let's see how they do
in October.

374
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,083
Oh, ye of little faith,

375
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:19,918
I am telling you,
this is the year.

376
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:22,221
Believing the cubs
are gonna win the pennant...

377
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:23,589
that is a symptom
of a delusional mind.

378
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:24,657
Rationality's overrated,

379
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:26,826
particularly
if you're a cubs fan.

380
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:30,110
I have to go.

381
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:32,765
I have a class tomorrow.

382
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:41,564
Good night, Daniel.

383
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:42,665
<i>And another...</i>

384
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,500
<i>bad throw by Baker.</i>

385
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:46,503
<i>Everybody's safe.</i>

386
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:48,238
<i>Sloppy game again defensively,</i>

387
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:50,373
<i>and that ultimately
cost the cubs.</i>

388
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:53,108
Sadists.

389
00:18:55,645 --> 00:19:01,817
Lewicki?!

390
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,461
Dr. Pierce...

391
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:13,696
I'm so sorry
to bother you at home.

392
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,219
You work at techsan.

393
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:16,379
My name's Gerard Permut.

394
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:18,314
What can I do for you,
Mr. Permut?

395
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:20,951
I- I have information
on Clark Weilman's murder.

396
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:22,719
You should go to the FBI.

397
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:25,956
No, I-I can't, I can't. I can't
trust them, okay? I can't.

398
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,958
Listen, I-I've read
all your books,

399
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:30,227
every single one of them,
and I-I know...

400
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:32,563
I know that you understand
people like me.

401
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:34,799
And, please, I don't...

402
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,201
I don't have anyone else
to turn to. I really...

403
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:38,936
all right, all right.
All right.

404
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:43,507
Come on.
Would you like to sit down?

405
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,842
I- I didn't
mean to do it,

406
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:45,943
but the voices
in my head...

407
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,044
<i>they told me
that I had to do it.</i>

408
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,747
All right. W-what did the voices
tell you to do?

409
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:53,483
I'm in love
with Valerie Nelson.

410
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:57,653
I found out that she was
sleeping with Clark Weilman.

411
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:02,292
The voices told me
that the pain would...

412
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,760
would go away if I killed him.

413
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:07,330
Ohh!

414
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,399
All right.
I- I'm gonna get you some help.

415
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:11,935
She told me that
we had a life together.

416
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,004
That's what she said. I never
should have trusted her, ever.

417
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:15,172
That bitch...
she's a liar!

418
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:16,107
Lewicki!

419
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:17,708
Who are you calling?
It's all right.

420
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:19,343
He works for me, all right?

421
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:21,578
W- we're gonna get you some help.
Lewicki!

422
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:24,715
You need something, doc?

423
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:27,283
I'm right in the middle of
kicking Obi-Wan's jedi ass.

424
00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:29,118
I'm sorry to call you away
from something so urgent.

425
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:31,921
But as you can see,
I have a situation here.

426
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:43,432
There's no one else here,
is there?

427
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:46,068
No, doc.

428
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:48,171
It's just you and me.

429
00:20:54,111 --> 00:20:56,446
Almost had you.

430
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:10,545
Doc, you have to eat.

431
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:13,849
This is not what I wanted.

432
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:15,284
It's mahler's first.

433
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,186
That is the Von karajan
recording.

434
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:18,554
I asked for the solti.

435
00:21:20,924 --> 00:21:24,226
Do you know how hard it is
to find a cassette tape?

436
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:25,995
All right, if you just let me
buy you an iPod,

437
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,197
we can download any recording
you want.

438
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:30,633
You know what? That's not a bad idea.
You got to get with the program.

439
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:31,868
Just stay out of this.

440
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:37,206
He's here?

441
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:41,543
You know, doc,

442
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:44,479
maybe this guy
isn't just a hallucination.

443
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:47,815
You know, maybe he's some kind
of psychic vision.

444
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,717
<i>There have been studies
that show that these...</i>

445
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:51,952
no, Lewicki,
there have been no studies.

446
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:54,789
There have been frauds and scams
and entertainments...

447
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:56,023
okay, you said
this vision told you

448
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:57,124
he was jealous of the dead guy.

449
00:21:57,158 --> 00:21:59,394
Maybe there really is some kind

450
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:03,097
of twisted love-triangle thing going on, you know?

451
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:04,366
Why do you keep
this idiot around?

452
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,767
Because when assholes
like you show up,

453
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:07,969
I need someone to tell me
that you're not real.

454
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:10,923
Answer that!

455
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,739
Dr. Pierce's residence.

456
00:22:17,477 --> 00:22:19,478
Yes, I'll tell him.

457
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:23,148
Dean Haley wants to see you.

458
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,011
What in God's name
were you thinking, Daniel?

459
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:27,580
I'll tell you exactly
what I was thinking, Paul.

460
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:29,582
I was thinking this
pheromone-spewing 20-year-old

461
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,251
has been sitting in
the front row of my class

462
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:33,020
making eyes at me
for three semesters running,

463
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:35,322
and now she's inviting me
for a latte.

464
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:36,424
Oh, and, by the way,

465
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,826
she's sticking a skin-tight
t- shirt in my face,

466
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:40,729
advertising herself
as a "stimulus package. "

467
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:43,965
I don't need any more stimuli.

468
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,634
Look, you can't just go around
accusing students

469
00:22:46,668 --> 00:22:48,536
of wanting to have sex
with you,

470
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,171
especially not in front
of witnesses.

471
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:51,306
What witnesses?

472
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,307
Are you really that oblivious?

473
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:54,408
She was with a friend.

474
00:22:54,443 --> 00:22:56,277
<i>That's who filed the complaint.</i>

475
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:57,745
You're joking.
Tell me you're...

476
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,947
Look, Daniel, I have put up
with all of your eccentricities

477
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:02,116
because you are
a brilliant scholar,

478
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,753
you're a popular teacher,
and you're my friend.

479
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:06,621
But have you any idea

480
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:09,991
what kind of a hit our endowment
has taken, hmm?

481
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:12,060
We cannot afford a lawsuit.

482
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:14,429
What are you asking me to do?

483
00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:17,264
<i>He wants me to apologize...
to both girls.</i>

484
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:19,433
It's outrageous!

485
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:22,369
Why are you smiling?
What, y-you think this is funny?

486
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:23,803
What I think is, is that
you deflected this offer

487
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:25,171
from this student
for the same reason

488
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:27,506
you turned down the dinner
invitation with Kate Moretti.

489
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,275
Enlighten me.

490
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,444
You are petrified of
anything remotely resembling

491
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:33,546
an intimate connection
with another human being.

492
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,849
Oh, spare me the psychobabble.

493
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:38,184
Tell me I'm wrong.

494
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:40,153
Natalie, look at me.

495
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:42,422
I- I-I hear voices.

496
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:45,959
I see things that aren't there.
I talk to the walls.

497
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:51,031
How am I ever gonna have

498
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:54,902
an intimate connection
with anybody?

499
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:57,738
You had an incident.

500
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,974
Daniel?

501
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:08,315
Well, sometimes this happens.

502
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,884
You deal with it,
and you move on.

503
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:12,754
Right.

504
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:15,390
So, why is it
that I get the feeling

505
00:24:15,424 --> 00:24:17,559
that you're more worried
about this than usual?

506
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,200
What if next time
it happens in front of Kate?

507
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:28,571
You told Kate about
your condition a long time ago.

508
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:33,843
Well, knowing and seeing
are two different things.

509
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,548
I don't... m-maybe
I should get off this case.

510
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:42,985
<i>Quit without solving it?
Then you'd really go crazy.</i>

511
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:47,791
Have you talked to rosenthal
about going back on your meds?

512
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:49,359
No, no.

513
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:52,628
We've talked... look, for some
people, they're a miracle...

514
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:53,796
n- not me.

515
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:55,932
But you had fewer symptoms.

516
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:58,468
And I couldn't concentrate
long enough

517
00:24:58,502 --> 00:24:59,803
to finish a damn sodoku.

518
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:02,071
I couldn't write.
I couldn't work.

519
00:25:02,106 --> 00:25:05,208
No, no, no.
I- I can handle this, nat.

520
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:09,378
I just... I'll keep up
my talk therapy with rosenthal.

521
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:13,116
I- I'll stick to my routine.
I'll watch my diet.

522
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,319
I'll keep my mind focused
and occupied.

523
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:18,755
Okay. Well,
let's focus on the incident.

524
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,823
Tell me about it.

525
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:21,091
What is there to tell?

526
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:23,227
It was a schizophrenic
hallucination.

527
00:25:23,261 --> 00:25:25,863
It was the product
of randomly firing neurons.

528
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:28,098
Daniel, you know
how your mind works.

529
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:30,134
Sometimes these hallucinations
tell you things

530
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:32,336
that your conscious mind
can't make sense of.

531
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:37,408
Tell me what you saw.

532
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:44,750
The man.

533
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:47,286
He works at techsan,
then he came to my house,

534
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,454
said he was the killer,

535
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:51,090
which I'm pretty sure
is physically impossible.

536
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:52,858
What else did he say?

537
00:25:57,464 --> 00:26:02,334
That Valerie Nelson is a liar.

538
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,602
Who is she?

539
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:07,738
She was having an affair
with the victim.

540
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:12,376
She says she has nothing to do
with the crime.

541
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:15,880
And the police believe her.

542
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:19,250
Well, if she's lying...

543
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:20,785
How could you prove it?

544
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,557
<i>The international atomic energy
agency confirmed in the 1990s</i>

545
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:26,892
<i>that Saddam Hussein</i>

546
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:29,861
<i>had an advanced nuclear weapons
development program.</i>

547
00:26:29,896 --> 00:26:31,930
Why are you making me relive
this nightmare?

548
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,131
Just watch.

549
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:34,399
<i>had a design
for a nuclear weapon</i>

550
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:36,534
<i>and was working
on five different methods</i>

551
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:38,536
<i>of enriching uranium
for a bomb.</i>

552
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,304
<i>The British government
has learned</i>

553
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:43,107
<i>that Saddam Hussein recently
sought significant quantities</i>

554
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:44,275
<i>of uranium from Africa.</i>

555
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:51,315
<i>Intelligence sources tell us
that he has attempted to...</i>

556
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:54,752
Thank you, Jimmy.

557
00:26:54,786 --> 00:26:56,453
Jimmy's an aphasiac.

558
00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:59,356
He's lost the ability to
comprehend spoken language.

559
00:26:59,391 --> 00:27:02,193
To compensate, many aphasiacs
become highly sensitive

560
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:04,161
to subtle inflections
in speech.

561
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:05,262
Now, when we lie,

562
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:07,631
those vocal nuances
become more pronounced.

563
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:10,234
Most of us wouldn't notice,
but aphasiacs do.

564
00:27:10,268 --> 00:27:12,770
And for some reason,
to them, it sounds funny.

565
00:27:12,804 --> 00:27:15,739
He's a human lie detector.

566
00:27:15,774 --> 00:27:17,074
Now, p-put that in.

567
00:27:19,644 --> 00:27:21,145
You're doing great.

568
00:27:26,518 --> 00:27:28,786
<i>So, where were you
on the night of march 5th?</i>

569
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:33,290
<i>Home...
Waiting for Clark to call.</i>

570
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:38,963
<i>It was the night he was gonna
tell Pamela he was leaving.</i>

571
00:27:50,275 --> 00:27:53,978
Ms. Nelson,
Agent Moretti, FBI.

572
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:04,456
Ms. Nelson?!

573
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,925
Valerie? Valerie?

574
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:13,398
I need an ambulance.

575
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:27,155
Robert!

576
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:29,090
Think she's gonna make it?

577
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,391
It's too early to say.

578
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:32,759
Vicious blow to the back
of the head like that?

579
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,428
She might not even
have seen her attacker.

580
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,497
Why are we still on this case?

581
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:39,900
Chicago p. D.
Should be handling it.

582
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:43,004
Just find out
who she's been talking to.

583
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:46,775
<i>What's the nature of your
relationship with Ms. Nelson?</i>

584
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:48,577
<i>I couldn't have picked her out
of the crowd</i>

585
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:49,778
<i>at the company picnic.</i>

586
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:50,812
<i>Then why the calls?</i>

587
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:52,548
<i>We came down here voluntarily.</i>

588
00:28:52,582 --> 00:28:54,183
Mr. klane isn't
under any obligation

589
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:55,250
to answer these questions.

590
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:57,053
Were you aware that Valerie
was having an affair

591
00:28:57,087 --> 00:28:58,354
with your dead general counsel?

592
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:00,423
What does that have to do
with me?

593
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:02,858
Maybe Clark Weilman
wasn't the only one

594
00:29:02,893 --> 00:29:06,028
getting executive perks
from Valerie.

595
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:09,532
<i>Maybe you found out,
got jealous, killed Clark,</i>

596
00:29:09,566 --> 00:29:11,033
<i>and then you tried to do
the same thing to Valerie.</i>

597
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:15,404
<i>What?!
We're done here.</i>

598
00:29:15,438 --> 00:29:16,939
<i>Even if she doesn't
survive this surgery,</i>

599
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:18,407
<i>we will find out
what the two of you were up to.</i>

600
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:21,744
<i>Okay, Philip, Philip, let's go.
Sit, sit, it's fine.</i>

601
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:25,447
Chamomile.
No milk, no sugar.

602
00:29:25,482 --> 00:29:26,482
<i>After Clark was killed,</i>

603
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,250
<i>I got an e-mail
from Ms. Valerie</i>

604
00:29:28,284 --> 00:29:30,786
<i>saying it was urgent
I should call her, so I did.</i>

605
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,020
You're welcome.

606
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:33,022
She said she had information

607
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,323
that could be damaging
to the company.

608
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,824
What kind of information?

609
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,860
Something about anomalous study
results for one of our products.

610
00:29:37,894 --> 00:29:40,296
<i>She said she didn't want to talk about it
Don't drink that.</i>

611
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,298
<i>What time?</i>

612
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,768
It might kill you.

613
00:29:48,273 --> 00:29:50,241
Are you trying to poison me?!

614
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:52,343
I told you, no milk, no sugar.

615
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:55,380
Come on, doc. That's the
murder weapon. Tea?

616
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:56,580
Yeah, it's tea.

617
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,185
Not tea... poison.
Remember Timothy may?

618
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:01,820
Said his mother was poisoned.

619
00:30:01,854 --> 00:30:03,989
I poisoned her...
And killed Clark Weilman.

620
00:30:04,023 --> 00:30:06,024
I don't understand.
What's to understand?

621
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:07,626
She's trying to
establish motive.

622
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,927
I'll give you a motive.

623
00:30:08,961 --> 00:30:10,929
She was going to expose me,
and now that's your job.

624
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:12,097
How?

625
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:14,734
Can you be quiet, please?
I'm trying to listen.

626
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:21,075
Aah!
What the hell?

627
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:22,743
I just bought this suit!

628
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:24,378
Sorry. Try club soda.

629
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:32,153
You've had a gut feeling
all this time, haven't you,

630
00:30:32,188 --> 00:30:33,956
especially after what
Timothy may said about his mom

631
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,491
and what those people
at techsan claimed

632
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:36,425
about the insulprin study.

633
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,360
What are you talking about?

634
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:39,695
Don't you remember my name?

635
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:41,663
Gerard Permut.
So what?

636
00:30:41,698 --> 00:30:43,465
So, I know how much
you like puzzles.

637
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,735
It's another anagram.

638
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:23,475
I solved it.

639
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,878
I think I solved it.

640
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:31,817
"Gerard Permut.
Drug tamperer. "

641
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:33,219
Who's Gerard Permut?

642
00:31:33,253 --> 00:31:34,520
You wrote on the wall?

643
00:31:34,554 --> 00:31:35,654
I think somebody tampered

644
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:37,189
with the results
of the insulprin study.

645
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:38,324
What makes you say that?

646
00:31:38,358 --> 00:31:39,792
Gut feeling.

647
00:31:39,826 --> 00:31:42,294
Timothy may believed his mother
was poisoned,

648
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:44,029
that her heart attack was caused
by the medication.

649
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:45,130
Timothy may is paranoid.

650
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:46,532
That doesn't make him wrong.

651
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:47,766
May's mother
was taking a placebo.

652
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,768
According to the data
reported by the company.

653
00:31:49,802 --> 00:31:51,270
Which you believe
was tampered with.

654
00:31:51,304 --> 00:31:53,672
It would cost
the company billions

655
00:31:53,707 --> 00:31:55,908
to pull that drug
off the market.

656
00:31:55,942 --> 00:31:58,911
C.E.O. Would certainly have
motive to cover that up.

657
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:00,313
Maybe.

658
00:32:00,347 --> 00:32:04,450
But who had direct access
to the study results?

659
00:32:09,423 --> 00:32:11,157
Dr. Bryant.

660
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:13,292
Agent Moretti.
Dr. Pierce.

661
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:16,296
What can I do for you?

662
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,397
We are trying to figure out

663
00:32:17,431 --> 00:32:18,931
who tried to kill
Valerie Nelson.

664
00:32:18,966 --> 00:32:21,734
We found these
on her hard drive.

665
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:25,805
We were hoping maybe you could
tell us what they are.

666
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,475
Well, these look like
study results

667
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:29,876
of morbidity rates.

668
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:31,578
Right,
from your insulprin trial,

669
00:32:31,612 --> 00:32:34,448
except they show an unusually
high incidence of heart attack

670
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:36,583
among women participating
in the study.

671
00:32:36,617 --> 00:32:39,252
Yeah, well, there...
there must be a mistake.

672
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:40,954
What about this one?

673
00:32:42,156 --> 00:32:44,390
Ah, yes.
These are the correct results.

674
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:45,692
Ah. You see here?

675
00:32:45,726 --> 00:32:47,961
The incidence of heart attacks
is approximately the same

676
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:48,962
for those taking the placebo

677
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:50,430
as for those
taking the real drug.

678
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:53,099
But only because somebody
tampered with these results.

679
00:32:53,134 --> 00:32:55,735
They moved patient names
from one group into the other.

680
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:58,159
Come on.
Who'd do something like that?

681
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,386
Valerie found out you were
falsifying the study,

682
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,522
so she went to her boyfriend,
techsan's top lawyer.

683
00:33:03,556 --> 00:33:05,624
They were gonna ruin everything
that you had worked for,

684
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:06,692
so you had to stop them.

685
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,126
That's ridiculous.

686
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:09,127
Size 10 brogans?

687
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:11,763
What?
Your shoes.

688
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:16,535
You left a bloody footprint
in Valerie's apartment.

689
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:33,852
You spend your whole career

690
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,787
looking for that
one miracle cure, you know?

691
00:33:37,123 --> 00:33:39,490
This wasn't about money for you.
It was about science.

692
00:33:39,525 --> 00:33:41,459
<i>You understand,
Dr. Pierce.</i>

693
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:43,461
Every drug has side effects.

694
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:45,964
I figured out why it was causing
the heart attacks.

695
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:47,899
I could have worked out
the kinks...

696
00:33:47,933 --> 00:33:50,568
But Valerie started
collecting evidence against me

697
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:51,669
like I'm a criminal.

698
00:33:51,704 --> 00:33:53,237
You mean the study results.

699
00:33:53,272 --> 00:33:54,839
Yes.

700
00:33:54,873 --> 00:33:57,075
And then I saw her
stealing pills...

701
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:03,847
So I followed her.

702
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:07,396
She brought them to Clark.

703
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:10,235
She goes to a lawyer
instead of me?!

704
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:11,096
You figured
that they were going

705
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,635
to get the pills
independently tested,

706
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:14,706
prove that they were dangerous.

707
00:34:15,207 --> 00:34:17,070
I thought...

708
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:19,210
If I could just
make him understand.

709
00:34:19,244 --> 00:34:21,187
Clark, I don't know what
Valerie's been telling you,

710
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,526
but I can fix this.

711
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:24,048
Do you have any idea
the liability

712
00:34:24,082 --> 00:34:25,316
you've exposed this company to?

713
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,149
Clark, please!

714
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:29,020
Get out of here
before I get the police!

715
00:34:31,977 --> 00:34:34,525
Ohh!

716
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:45,890
I guess I went a little crazy.

717
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:53,331
Nice work, detective.

718
00:34:53,365 --> 00:34:54,432
Psycho.

719
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,834
You didn't tell me
you found a footprint

720
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:56,802
in Valerie's apartment.

721
00:34:56,836 --> 00:34:57,903
I didn't.

722
00:34:57,937 --> 00:35:01,060
Detective Moretti, I am shocked

723
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:02,662
that you would
so blatantly manipulate

724
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:03,900
an obviously troubled
individual.

725
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,967
What's up, doc?

726
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:13,265
Daniel, what is it?

727
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:15,091
Case isn't over yet.

728
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:17,227
What are you talking about?

729
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,698
Daniel?

730
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,022
Dr. Bryant!

731
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:25,735
What now?

732
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,362
You said you figured out why

733
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:29,038
insulprin was
causing heart attacks.

734
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:31,405
What was it?

735
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:34,834
The drug was depleting
patients' thiamine levels.

736
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,901
Daniel, what is going on?

737
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,937
There's another victim.

738
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:48,155
Ms. Nelson?
I'm Agent Moretti, FBI.

739
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,390
This is Dr. Pierce.

740
00:35:49,424 --> 00:35:51,258
Would you mind if I asked you
a couple questions

741
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:53,327
for our case
against Dr. Bryant?

742
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:57,164
I still can't believe
he tried to kill me.

743
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,799
Well, you found out

744
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:02,236
he was tampering
with the insulprin study,

745
00:36:02,271 --> 00:36:03,971
so you told Clark Weilman
about your suspicions?

746
00:36:04,005 --> 00:36:06,607
I knew that drug
was gonna hurt a lot of people

747
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:07,875
when it hit the market.

748
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:09,009
Clark was a lawyer.

749
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:11,378
I- I figured
he'd know what to do.

750
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:14,981
So he told you
you needed more evidence?

751
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:16,949
That's why you brought him
the pills?

752
00:36:16,984 --> 00:36:19,818
Clark didn't want to expose
the company to any liability

753
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:20,953
unless he knew for sure.

754
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:23,021
Dr. Bryant had done
something wrong.

755
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:25,758
What?

756
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:28,127
It's just funny you didn't tell
the police any of this.

757
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:30,496
T- they wanted to know about
my relationship with Clark.

758
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:32,799
I didn't think it had anything
to do with the drug.

759
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:33,800
Oh, come on.

760
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:35,202
You gave Clark Weilman
those pills

761
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,071
so he could poison
his wife, right?

762
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:48,799
Are you out of your mind?

763
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,468
Well, that's not
the clinical description,

764
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:51,670
but yes, actually.

765
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:54,272
And poor Dr. Bryant...
he was out of his mind, too.

766
00:36:54,307 --> 00:36:56,308
He was feeling so guilty
for what he'd done

767
00:36:56,342 --> 00:36:57,309
that he became paranoid,

768
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:58,977
and he made
the same mistake we did.

769
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:01,213
He assumed that you'd stolen
those pills as evidence

770
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:02,748
when in fact you were supplying
Clark Weilman

771
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:03,882
with the perfect murder weapon.

772
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,150
What are you talking about?

773
00:37:05,185 --> 00:37:06,785
The drug wasn't
on the market yet,

774
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,321
so it was
virtually untraceable.

775
00:37:08,355 --> 00:37:09,822
You must have been dosing
Pamela for weeks,

776
00:37:09,856 --> 00:37:11,190
just waiting for her heart
to give out.

777
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:13,192
I was trying to do
the right thing.

778
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:15,961
Why else would I call the C.E.O.
Of the company

779
00:37:15,995 --> 00:37:18,430
and tell him
about the falsified results?

780
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,631
You were worried
that Pamela found out

781
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:20,999
her husband was poisoning her.

782
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,702
If she went to the police,
you would need a cover story

783
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:24,870
to explain why you had given him
the pills,

784
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:27,072
so you pretended
to be a whistle-blower.

785
00:37:27,106 --> 00:37:29,207
<i>No.
That is not right.</i>

786
00:37:29,242 --> 00:37:30,909
No, what's not right

787
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:33,612
is that Pamela Weilman was
accused of killing her husband

788
00:37:33,646 --> 00:37:35,480
when in fact
you and your boyfriend

789
00:37:35,515 --> 00:37:37,616
were trying to kill her.

790
00:37:42,388 --> 00:37:44,122
I want a lawyer.

791
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:45,957
Gonna need a good one.

792
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,295
Nice working with you, doc.

793
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:03,694
You wanted to see me,
Professor?

794
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:07,315
Karyn, yes.
Uh, come in, please.

795
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,452
Um, I-I wanted
to apologize

796
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:12,920
for what I said on the common
the other day.

797
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:14,489
It was... it was,
uh, highly inappropriate

798
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:19,360
and, uh, uh, offensive.

799
00:38:19,395 --> 00:38:21,329
And very perceptive.

800
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:27,167
I'm sorry my friend
was such a bitch.

801
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:30,737
I told her not to file
that complaint.

802
00:38:30,771 --> 00:38:36,309
Oh, oh, uh, uh,
could you...

803
00:38:36,344 --> 00:38:39,279
could you just wait...
uh, wait here one second?

804
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:41,982
Lewicki!

805
00:38:42,016 --> 00:38:43,717
W- what is it, doc?

806
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:47,154
I need you to tell me if
there's someone in my office.

807
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,427
Hey!

808
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:01,269
That one was definitely real.

809
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:07,075
Last week, I asked,
"what is reality?"

810
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,947
This week,
I want to talk about normalcy.

811
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:14,650
What is normal?

812
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:19,121
If you feel sad, do you just
have a case of the blues,

813
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:23,292
or are you suffering
from a neurochemical imbalance?

814
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:28,297
The vast majority
of the case studies

815
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,532
that we've been looking at

816
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:32,335
involve patients whose brains
are anything but normal,

817
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,637
and there's no question
they suffer.

818
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:38,474
But...

819
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,476
Is it all bad?

820
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:43,813
For some,
their neurological states

821
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:45,648
might actually protect them

822
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,519
from painful truths that no one
would want to think about.

823
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,023
Others develop
a- a cheerful disposition

824
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,092
that may help them cope
with situations

825
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,327
the rest of us
would find disturbing.

826
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:03,300
And if we are
to establish a baseline,

827
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,302
then we also
have to ask ourselves

828
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,871
how the brains of even
so-called normal people

829
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,441
respond to certain stimuli.

830
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:20,663
And if we're able to
treat those people

831
00:40:20,697 --> 00:40:23,132
living with
neurological disorders,

832
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:27,570
restore them to...
quote... "normalcy,"

833
00:40:27,604 --> 00:40:30,606
well, of course
we're helping them.

834
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:34,810
But might we sometimes
also be stripping away

835
00:40:34,845 --> 00:40:37,212
what makes them unique...

836
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:43,252
robbing them
of an essential part

837
00:40:43,286 --> 00:40:46,155
of who they are?
