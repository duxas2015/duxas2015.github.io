00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,691
WHY?

173
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,693
'CAUSE THAT PIECE OF EUROTRASH
MESSED WITH HER HEAD.

174
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,985
WHICH PIECE OF EUROTRASH
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

175
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,128
THIS GUY KARL.

176
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,862
SOME PRUSSIAN PRINCE
OR SOMETHING.

177
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:47,267
THINKS, LIKE, A TITLE MAKES HIM
BETTER THAN THE REST OF US.

178
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,740
THIS GUY IS A JERK.

179
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,269
GOES THROUGH WOMEN
LIKE KLEENEX IN FLU SEASON.

180
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,484
GUY STOLE YOUR GIRL.
THAT'S GOT TO BE ROUGH.

181
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,009
NO, NO.
THIS GUY'S BAD NEWS.

182
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,284
I GOOGLED HIM,
FOUND OUT ALL SORTS OF DIRT.

183
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,112
THAT'S WHY
I WENT TO SEE CHRISTINA,

184
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,978
TO TELL HER NOT TO GET MIXED UP
WITH THE GUY.

185
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,716
AND THEN WHEN SHE DIDN'T LISTEN,
YOU GOT ANGRY.

186
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:08,493
YES, BUT...
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HER.

187
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,792
SHE WAS ALIVE
WHEN I LEFT.

188
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,534
ANYBODY SEE YOU GO?

189
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,031
YEAH. KARL.

190
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,732
TOLD ME
TO LEAVE CHRISTINA ALONE.

191
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,134
I HEARD HIM YELLING AT HER
WHEN I LEFT.

192
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,525
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE THAT CREEP KILLED HER.

193
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,227
YEAH,
MY MONEY'S STILL ON YOU.

194
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,738
I DIDN'T DO THIS.

195
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,740
THEN WHY'D YOU RUN?

196
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,911
BEC...

197
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,979
BECAUSE I HAD A JOINT
IN MY POCKET.

198
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,038
I WAS AFRAID
YOU WERE GONNA BUST ME,

199
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,178
SO I FLUSHED IT.

200
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,512
YOU SHOULD BE TALKING
TO KARL.

201
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:37,047
Kate: "PRINCE KARL
OF HESSE-BRANDENBERG.

202
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,924
THIRD SON OF A MINOR
GERMAN NOBLE FAMILY."

203
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,163
SO NO POWER LEFT,
JUST TITLES AND CASTLES.

204
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:49,196
ACCORDING TO "LIFESTYLES
OF THE RICH AND INFAMOUS,"

205
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,999
KARL IS
QUITE THE PROBLEM CHILD.

206
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,472
LOOKS LIKE
HE'S BEEN EXPELLED

207
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,340
FROM TWO BOARDING SCHOOLS
IN ENGLAND...

208
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,438
ACCUSED OF SLAPPING
A MODEL

209
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,870
IN A DISCOTHèQUE
IN MONTE CARLO...

210
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:03,037
ACCUSED OF THE RAPE
OF A HOTEL MAID IN IBIZA,

211
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,376
BUT NO CHARGES
WERE EVER FILED.

212
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,082
I'LL BET A VERY FAT CHECK
GOES A LONG WAY

213
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,784
TO CONVINCING A VICTIM
NOT TO PROSECUTE.

214
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:11,516
THE AGENT I SENT TO KARL'S CONDO
CALLED IN.

215
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,591
DOORMAN SAYS HE LEFT LAST NIGHT
FOR THE AIRPORT.

216
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:16,592
I'LL CALL TSA, HAVE THEM CHECK
AIRLINE MANIFESTS.

217
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,364
YOU THINK THE PLAYBOY
OF THE WESTERN WORLD

218
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,461
FLIES COMMERCIAL?

219
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,962
HE'S GOT A PRIVATE PLANE.

220
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,104
WELL, HE MUST HAVE FILED
A FLIGHT PLAN.

221
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,600
TO ST. LOUIS.
IT NEVER GOT THERE.

222
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,543
REACH OUT TO HOMELAND,
STATE, INTERPOL.

223
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,098
MAYBE SOMEBODY KNOWS
WHERE THIS PLANE REALLY WENT.

224
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,067
HMM.

225
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,749
HEY.

226
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,382
SMART GUY.

227
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,185
WE NEED TO TALK.

228
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,119
YEAH, I'M...
KIND OF BUSY.

229
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:52,656
THAT'S OKAY.
I'VE GOT TO GET SOME SLEEP.

230
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,234
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU LATER.

231
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,226
WHAT THE [BLEEP]
ARE YOU DOING?

232
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,565
EXCUSE ME?

233
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,243
YOU DON'T
COME TO CLASS,

234
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,142
YOU DON'T HAND IN YOUR PAPER,
IT'S 7:00 A.M., YOU --

235
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,944
HAVE YOU BEEN UP PARTYING
ALL NIGHT?

236
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,606
SINCE WHEN IS MY SOCIAL LIFE
YOUR BUSINESS?

237
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,275
YOU'RE ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST
STUDENTS AT THIS UNIVERSITY,

238
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,424
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU
AT ONE OF MY LECTURES.

239
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,290
YOU'RE BLOWING YOUR CHANCES
AT MED SCHOOL.

240
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:22,459
WHO SAYS
I WANT TO GO TO MED SCHOOL?

241
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,359
YOU'RE CHANGING
YOUR MAJOR?

242
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,531
MAN...

243
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,359
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT MAJORS
AND CRAMMING FOR MIDTERMS.

244
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,897
I'VE GOT A BAND,
A GIRLFRIEND...

245
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,932
AND YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
FOR ALL OF THAT

246
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,097
ONCE YOU FLUNK OUT.

247
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,435
LOOK, I'M WORKING
ON THE PAPER.

248
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,939
WORK FASTER.

249
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,241
I'M GIVING YOU TILL
THE END OF THE DAY TOMORROW

250
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,543
TO TURN IN THAT PAPER,
OR I'M FAILING YOU.

251
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,045
NOW GET YOUR [BLEEP]
TO CLASS.

252
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,679
Daniel:
MR. LEWICKI HERE TELLS ME

253
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:50,145
THAT YOU'VE BEEN FALLING ASLEEP
IN SECTION ALL WEEK.

254
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,323
NO, SIR.ORING YOU?

255
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,322
THERE'S NO NEED
TO DENY IT.

256
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,464
I'M SURE A STUDENT
OF YOUR PERSPICACITY

257
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,829
MUST BE UNCHALLENGED
BY INTRO TO NEUROPSYCH.

258
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,289
Y-YOUR MIDTERM PAPER

259
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,697
DISPLAYS A BRILLIANT GRASP
OF THE SUBJECT.

260
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,330
I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE

261
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,534
ABOUT YOUR ALTERNATIVE VIEW
OF THE MIND-BODY LINK.

262
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,201
YOU REMEMBER --
PAGE 12?

263
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,006
YOU DIDN'T WRITE THIS,
DID YOU?

264
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,180
NO, SIR.
I BOUGHT IT.

265
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,712
WHO FROM?

266
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,478
RUMOR IS
HE'S A GRAD STUDENT,

267
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,415
BUT I DON'T KNOW
THE DUDE'S NAME.

268
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,151
THEN HOW'D YOU
GET THE PAPER?

269
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,486
A GUY ON THE TEAM
GAVE ME AN E-MAIL ADDRESS.

270
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,332
I SENT THE ASSIGNMENT
AND 200 BUCKS THROUGH PayPal.

271
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,199
AND A COUPLE DAYS LATER, THE
ESSAY SHOWED UP IN MY E-MAIL.

272
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,866
I-I'M SORRY.
I-I'VE NEVER CHEATED BEFORE.

273
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,700
OH, COME ON.
I'VE SEEN YOUR GRADES.

274
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,935
YOU'VE BEEN GETTING A FREE PASS
AROUND HERE.

275
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,111
BUT NOT THIS TIME,
NOT FROM ME.

276
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,439
I SWEAR,
I USED TO BE A GOOD STUDENT.

277
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,505
I JUST...

278
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,683
[ SIGHS ]

279
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,681
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE
ANYMORE.

280
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,123
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
FEELING LIKE THAT?

281
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,589
I DON'T KNOW.
PRETTY MUCH ALL SEMESTER.

282
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,689
LOOK ME
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE.

283
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,327
YOU SEE THIS?

284
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,674
SEE THE DISPARITY
IN PUPIL SIZE?

285
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,970
IT'S ANISCHORIA.

286
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,872
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

287
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:20,144
HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING
TROUBLE BREATHING?

288
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,373
A LITTLE.

289
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,208
HEADACHES?

290
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,553
YEAH.
HOW DID -- HOW'D YOU KNOW?

291
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,248
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN PLAYING FOOTBALL?

292
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,650
I MEAN, I STARTED PEE-WEE AT 8,
FULL CONTACT WHEN I WAS 9.

293
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,554
HAVE YOU BEEN HIT
HARDER THAN USUAL LATELY?

294
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,486
I MEAN, I ENDED UP
AT THE BOTTOM OF A DOG PILE

295
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,094
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO,
AND MY HELMET FLEW OFF.

296
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,057
I MEAN, BACK OF MY HEAD
GOT STOMPED PRETTY HARD.

297
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:03,915
WELL, AS I SUSPECTED,
YOU HAVE A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA.

298
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,751
A BRAIN BLEED.

299
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,085
AM I GONNA MISS THE GAME
ON SATURDAY?

300
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,091
YEAH. AND EVERY ONE
AFTER THAT.

301
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,634
I'M OUT FOR THE SEASON?

302
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,299
YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT.

303
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,668
YOU CAN'T PLAY FOOTBALL
EVER AGAIN.

304
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:24,297
IF I DON'T PLAY,
I'LL LOSE MY SCHOLARSHIP.

305
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,307
IT'S EITHER THAT,
OR RISK PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE.

306
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,780
YOUR CHOICE.

307
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,119
I FOUND KARL --
IN CABO SAN LUCAS.

308
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,089
AND THEY SAY
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

309
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,748
AS INTER-AGENCY
COOPERATION.

310
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,086
I'M GLAD
STATE CAME THROUGH.

311
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,321
THEY DIDN'T.

312
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,085
THEN WHO LOCATED HIM?
HOMELAND?

313
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,255
INTERPOL?

314
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,563
TMZ.

315
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,725
I NEED YOU TO SIGN OFF
ON A TRAVEL VOUCHER

316
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,674
SO I CAN GO DOWN
AND PICK HIM UP.

317
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,470
WE'RE ON
AN AUSTERITY BUDGET.

318
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,802
LET THE MEXICAN POLICE
PICK HIM UP.

319
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,107
LISTEN, THE FEDERALES

320
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,369
AREN'T EXACTLY KNOWN
FOR THEIR...INTEGRITY.

321
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,238
THE MONEY
GETS INTO THE RIGHT HANDS,

322
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,906
KARL'S OFF TO A COUNTRY
WHERE WE CAN'T EXTRADITE HIM.

323
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,592
SO, WHERE TO, CHICAS?

324
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,255
THE BEACH...

325
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,903
OR THE POOL?

326
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,859
ADULT SWIM'S OVER,
KARL.

327
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,543
PARDON ME, LADIES.

328
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:29,598
HE'S COMING WITH ME.

329
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,106
[ CELL DOOR OPENS ]

330
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,839
YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY
WITH TREATING ME LIKE THIS!

331
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,805
IF I GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST,
IT'S WORTH IT,

332
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,714
BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT YOU MURDERED CHRISTINA.

333
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,346
I DIDN'T KILL HER!

334
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,781
OH, YEAH?
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.

335
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,215
I'M NOT A MORON.

336
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:47,721
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING ELSE
WITHOUT MY LAWYER.

337
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,064
THEN I GUESS
MY JOB HERE IS DONE.

338
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,560
OH. LOOK AT THAT.

339
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,761
RIGHT IN TIME
FOR THE 4:00 FLIGHT. HMM.

340
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,973
OKAY. ENJOY YOUR STAY.

341
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,797
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I COULD TAKE YOU WITH ME.

342
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,306
IF YOU JUST SIGN THIS LITTLE
WAIVER OF EXTRADITION,

343
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,080
WE COULD BE ON OUR WAY
TO THE AIRPORT.

344
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,450
YOU COULD CALL YOUR LAWYER
FROM THE PLANE.

345
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,318
D.J.: DR. PIERCE.

346
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,420
I FINISHED THE ESSAY

347
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,522
WITH A COUPLE HOURS
TO SPARE.

348
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,424
I'M SURPRISED YOU PUT
SO MUCH TIME INTO IT.

349
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,087
HEY, IT'S DONE,
SO SAVE THE LECTURE.

350
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,227
STAY.

351
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,396
I'LL READ IT NOW.

352
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,402
IS THIS A JOKE?

353
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,666
HEY, I BUSTED MY [BLEEP]
ON THAT PAPER.

354
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,465
THIS ISN'T YOUR WORK.

355
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,037
YESTERDAY YOU TOLD ME

356
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,105
THAT I WAS ONE OF
THE SMARTEST STUDENTS HERE,

357
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,084
SO YOU KNOW
I DON'T NEED TO CHEAT.

358
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,253
I WROTE THIS.

359
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,081
25 YEARS AGO, TO BE EXACT,
WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRAD.

360
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,888
DID YOU THINK I WOULDN'T
RECOGNIZE MY OWN WORDS,

361
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,249
OR ARE YOU JUST
TRYING TO BE CUTE?

362
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,087
I'M TELLING YOU
I WROTE IT.

363
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,093
YOU'VE JUST DESTROYED
YOUR ACADEMIC FUTURE.

364
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,625
FINE.

365
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,699
YOU THINK I WANT TO SIT
IN A DUSTY, OLD OFFICE

366
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,999
ALL DAY, LIKE YOU?

367
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,072
NO FREAKING WAY.

368
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,700
YOUR LIFE
IS SAD AND PATHETIC...

369
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,736
OLD MAN.

370
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,869
WHO THE [BLEEP]
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

371
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,807
OH, I'M -- I'M SORRY.
DID -- DID YOU FORGET MY NAME?

372
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:20,614
IT'S D.J.,

373
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,947
SHORT FOR
DANIEL J. PIERCE.

374
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,392
I'M YOU.

375
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,721
BEFORE YOU CRACKED UP
AND FORGOT HOW TO HAVE A LIFE.

376
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,688
Max:
HEY, DOC, WE'RE LATE.

377
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,825
ARE YOU OKAY?

378
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,739
Daniel: HOW COULD I
NOT RECOGNIZE MYSELF?

379
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:52,106
I DIDN'T MAKE THE CONNECTION
UNTIL HE TOLD ME HIS NAME.

380
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:55,275
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
ANY OF YOUR STUDENTS' NAMES.

381
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,615
IT'S ALWAYS "GRIDIRON GUY,"
"GOTH GIRL."

382
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,190
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

383
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,849
OH, COME ON, DANIEL.

384
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,687
IT'S PSYCH 101.
IT'S A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

385
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,492
YOU KEEP YOUR STUDENTS
AT ARM'S LENGTH

386
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,064
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
WANT TO REMEMBER

387
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,663
WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO BE THEIR AGE.

388
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,664
THAT'S [BLEEP]

389
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,655
IS IT?

390
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,667
WHAT WERE YOU LIKE
AT 19?

391
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,199
INSUFFERABLY COCKY.

392
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,674
I THOUGHT I WAS SMARTER
THAN MOST OF MY TEACHERS,

393
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,843
DIDN'T CARE MUCH
ABOUT MY EDUCATION

394
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,270
'CAUSE IT ALL CAME
SO EASILY.

395
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,506
AND WHAT DID YOU WANT TO DO
WITH YOUR LIFE?

396
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,511
TRAVEL THE WORLD.

397
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:27,153
CLIMB KILIMANJARO.
TOUR WITH MY BAND.

398
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,350
YOU WANTED TO GO
TO MED SCHOOL.

399
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,351
NO.

400
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,022
THAT WAS JUST A FALLBACK,

401
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,590
IN CASE I DIDN'T MAKE THE COVER
OF ROLLING STONE

402
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,589
BY THE TIME I WAS 25.

403
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,850
YET FOR ALL THAT AMBITION

404
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,857
AND SUCH AN ACTIVE
LIMBIC SYSTEM,

405
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,659
NONE OF THAT
EVER HAPPENED.

406
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,160
YEAH.

407
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,562
A LITTLE THING CALLED
PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA

408
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:42,904
KIND OF GOT IN THE WAY.

409
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,559
SO YOU GOT DIAGNOSED,
AND YOUR DREAMS DIED.

410
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,197
NO WONDER
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE D.J.

411
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,704
YOU WANTED TO FORGET

412
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,895
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'D LOST
WHEN YOU GOT SICK.

413
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:55,578
GEE, THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME
FEEL LIKE A COMPLETE FAILURE.

414
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,838
YOU'RE
MISSING THE POINT.

415
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,007
PLEASE,
SKEWER ME WITH IT.

416
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,246
LOOK AT WHAT
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED

417
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,252
IN SPITE
OF YOUR DIAGNOSIS.

418
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,694
TOP OF YOUR CLASS
IN MED SCHOOL,

419
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,859
YOU'VE WRITTEN SEVEN BOOKS,
WON THE DAVENPORT PRIZE.

420
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,359
COMPARED TO WHERE
YOU COULD HAVE ENDED UP,

421
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,392
YOU'VE TRULY CLIMBED
KILIMANJARO.

422
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,227
SO I REPRESSED
MY TRAGIC PAST

423
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,433
RATHER THAN CONFRONT
MY SHORTCOMINGS.

424
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,095
HOW VERY FREUDIAN OF ME.

425
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:22,773
TELL ME, FRAU DOKTOR,
IN YOUR HALLUCINATORY OPINION,

426
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,942
WHY AM I BEING HAUNTED BY
THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST NOW?

427
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,612
BECAUSE YOUR
UNRESOLVED ISSUES

428
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,940
ARE KEEPING YOU FROM
DEALING WITH YOUR STUDENTS.

429
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,576
I DEAL WITH MY STUDENTS
EVERY DAY.

430
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,951
YOU LECTURE THEM.

431
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,419
BUT EMOTIONALLY,
YOU'RE TOTALLY DISENGAGED.

432
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,078
I'M A PROFESSOR,
NOT A WET NURSE.

433
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,616
NOW, WHAT ABOUT
BRIAN CAHILL?

434
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,121
HE HAD HIS FUTURE TAKEN AWAY
BECAUSE OF A BRAIN INJURY.

435
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,094
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO RELATE TO THAT.

436
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,762
BUT, NO, YOU JUST MADE
THE DIAGNOSIS AND WALKED AWAY.

437
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,802
HEY, I SAVED
THAT KID'S LIFE.

438
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,628
BUT WAS THE LIFE YOU SAVED
THE ONE HE WANTED?

439
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,573
Brian:
YOU ASKED TO SEE ME?

440
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:59,472
I JUST...
WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

441
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,966
WHAT FOR?

442
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,438
I WAS A LITTLE PERFUNCTORY
ABOUT YOUR DIAGNOSIS.

443
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,907
I-I SHOULD HAVE
DONE MORE

444
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,975
TO HELP YOU ACCLIMATE
TO YOUR CONDITION.

445
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,654
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO YOUR PARENTS?
I-I COULD CALL THEM.

446
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,393
AH, NO. IT'S OKAY.

447
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,989
I TOLD DEAN HALEY

448
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,990
THAT YOUR INJURY WAS SUSTAINED
ON THE FIELD,

449
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,762
SO YOUR SCHOLARSHIP
WON'T BE REVOKED.

450
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,660
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY
TO STAY IN SCHOOL.

451
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:23,162
HERE'S A REFERRAL
TO A THERAPIST

452
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,496
WHO SPECIALIZES
IN NEUROLOGICAL ISSUES.

453
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,932
TALKING HELPS.

454
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:29,936
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE PAPER YOU BOUGHT.

455
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,669
WE'LL, UH...
WE'LL LET THAT SLIDE.

456
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:36,175
THANKS, DR. PIERCE.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

457
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,839
Max: HEY, DOC.

458
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,507
OH. HEY, BRHEY.

459
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:43,347
SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
BUT, UM, KATE CALLED.

460
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:45,253
SHE'S BACK FROM MEXICO.

461
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,194
KARL DID NOT KILL
CHRISTINA.

462
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,862
WITNESSES PLACE HIM IN HER DORM
ROOM RIGHT BEFORE HER DEATH.

463
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,361
SHE WAS ALIVE
WHEN I TOOK OFF.

464
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,703
YEAH,
BUT YOU WERE ARGUING.

465
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,858
I WANTED HER TO COME WITH ME
TO A PARTY IN MEXICO,

466
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,527
BUT SHE THOUGHT A MIDTERM
IN SOCIOLOGY WAS MORE IMPORTANT.

467
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:02,968
SO I LEFT.

468
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,642
YEAH, AND YOU TOOK
SOME OF HER DNA WITH YOU.

469
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,811
WE SEARCHED
YOUR APARTMENT,

470
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,609
AND WE FOUND SMEARS
OF CHRISTINA'S BLOOD

471
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,042
ALL OVER YOUR FLOOR.

472
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,177
YOU MUST HAVE TRACKED IT IN
ON YOUR SHOES.

473
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,880
GIVE US A MOMENT,
WOULD YOU?

474
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:20,847
ATTAGIRL.

475
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,334
THANK YOU.

476
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,029
LAST WEEK, CHRISTINA
WAS OVER AT MY PLACE,

477
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,531
AND SHE HAD A NOSEBLEED.

478
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,333
WHY? OFFS ]

479
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,765
BECAUSE
YOU BACKHANDED HER?

480
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,900
I DON'T LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE,
AGENT MORETTI.

481
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:38,044
MY CLIENT
HAS NOTHING MORE TO SAY.

482
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,070
THAT'S FINE.
I'VE GOT ENOUGH TO HOLD HIM.

483
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,876
YEAH, JUST ONE
SMALL PROBLEM, THOUGH.

484
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,410
[ CHUCKLES ]
KARL HAS AN ALIBI.

485
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,906
I JUST GOT A TEXT
FROM MY INVESTIGATOR.

486
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,647
HE'S BRINGING
A WITNESS DOWN NOW

487
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,022
WHO CAN PROVE KARL
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

488
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,428
I WAS HEADING BACK
FROM THE LIBRARY,

489
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,428
AND I RAN INTO KARL
OUTSIDE THE DORM.

490
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,890
SO YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER.

491
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,898
[ CHUCKLES ] WELL,
HE'S KIND OF HARD TO MISS.

492
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,900
HE --
HE DRIVES A FERRARI.

493
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,442
OKAY.
DID YOU TALK TO HIM?

494
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:11,438
HE LOOKED UPSET,
SO I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS OKAY,

495
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:15,111
AND HE SAID HE JUST HAD THIS
BIG FIGHT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

496
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,241
DID HE SAY
ANYTHING ELSE?

497
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:23,575
NO. HE JUST GOT IN HIS CAR
AND DROVE OFF.

498
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,546
SO NOW YOU KNOW
HE DIDN'T DO IT, RIGHT?

499
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,715
NO.
I'M SORRY, SHANNON.

500
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,724
YOUR STORY DOES NOT PROVE
THAT KARL'S INNOCENT.

501
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:33,086
I MEAN, FOR ALL WE KNOW,
HE COULD HAVE LOOKED UPSET

502
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,795
BECAUSE HE HAD
JUST MURDERED CHRISTINA.

503
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,058
NO WAY.
SHE WAS STILL ALIVE.

504
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,966
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

505
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:41,628
I SAW HER YELLING OUT THE WINDOW
AT HIM AS HE DROVE OFF.

506
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,265
I SAW HER, SO KARL
COULDN'T HAVE KILLED HER.

507
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,352
I JUST DON'T BUY IT.

508
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:59,654
SHANNON POPS UP
OUT OF NOWHERE

509
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,716
WITH AN ALIBI THAT KARL
