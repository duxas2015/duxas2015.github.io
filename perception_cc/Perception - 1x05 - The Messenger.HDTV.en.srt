2
00:00:02,852 --> 00:00:06,661
The one day of the week..
No lectures, no office hours,

3
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:08,342
- no obligations of any kind..
- Doc..

4
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:10,565
The one day that I.. I get
a little solitude, you know,

5
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:12,434
a little "me" time, a chance
to do some actual writing.

6
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:13,602
Haley twisted my arm.

7
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:15,504
Your arm is mine to twist, not Haley's.

8
00:00:15,505 --> 00:00:19,705
Did he even say what this was about?

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,117
Daniel, it is my honor to inform
you that you have been awarded

10
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,891
this year's Davenport Prize
for exploration in science.

11
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:30,119
I.. I swear, I knew nothing about this.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,552
And, as I'm sure you are aware,
this award is not just about

13
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:36,625
the laurels you bring to
yourself and the university.

14
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:40,749
It's also about the $50,000
check that goes along with it.

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,419
Woo!

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,180
To Daniel Pierce.

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

18
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:01,650
Daniel.

19
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:03,686
How could you blindside me like that?

20
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:07,597
You are making me look bad
in front of the Chancellor.

21
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:11,133
The man put you up for this
prize, for goodness sakes.

22
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:13,095
Just one handshake.
That's all I'm asking.

23
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:14,995
Kate.

24
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:17,148
Please tell me you're here about a case.

25
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:19,021
- Yes, I am, but this..
- Ms. Moretti,

26
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:21,194
I agreed to allow Daniel
to consult with the FBI

27
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:23,806
so long as it didn't interfere
with his academic duties.

28
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:25,540
And right now you are interfering with..

29
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,985
Actually, I'm here to talk to you.

30
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:29,768
To me?

31
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:32,350
Yeah, listen, a jogger
was found shot in the back

32
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:33,845
in the national forest preserve.

33
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:35,415
We're having trouble making an I.D.

34
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,663
There's no wallet on him,
no match on the fingerprints.

35
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,236
What has this got to do with him?

36
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:41,246
All we've got to go on
are some tattoos on the

37
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:43,291
body which appear to
be religious in nature,

38
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:46,494
and Dean Haley's course
on spiritual iconography

39
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:49,094
was one of the best classes I ever took.

40
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:50,677
I'm flattered you remember.

41
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:53,292
Anyhow, I'm hoping you could
take a look at the tattoos,

42
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:56,769
let me know if there's anything about
them that could help me I.D. the victim.

43
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,315
I confess I've always been
something of an armchair Detective.

44
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:01,317
Paul, you couldn't
possibly. The Chancellor.

45
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:05,250
I just tell him that it's a
murder investigation, right?

46
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,272
Come on, Daniel. You'll need to
keep him entertained while I'm gone.

47
00:02:08,273 --> 00:02:09,625
Help me.

48
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:12,464
Wh.. Uh, Dean Haley, uh, actually,

49
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,998
our victim may have
suffered some head injuries,

50
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:17,456
so I do need a brain
specialist to review the X-rays.

51
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:21,841
You couldn't possibly spare
Daniel, uh, just for an hour?

52
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,819
I'm sure the Chancellor will understand.

53
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,940
This is very exciting.

54
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,827
Oh.

55
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:38,362
Probably a little too much
bubbly at the reception, I think.

56
00:02:38,363 --> 00:02:42,068
Okay. Um, let's see what we've got here.

57
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:47,052
Well, the Angel appears to draw
from Christian influences, but..

58
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:49,468
These eight wings..

59
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,572
Probably represent the
eight arms of Shiva..

60
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,240
The Hindu God of destruction.

61
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,854
Ah. Uh-huh.

62
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:59,209
Which would make this simian
figure representative of Hanuman.

63
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,479
The Hindu monkey God.

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,873
And I'd say these numbers
represent the book of Ruth..

65
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:06,986
Chapter 1, verse 16.

66
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,255
"Thy people shall be my people".

67
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:12,671
The words Naomi spoke when converting
to the faith of her Mother-in-law.

68
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:16,076
So, you probably want to make
inquiries at a local Hindu temple

69
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:19,450
frequented by converts from
the Judeo-Christian tradition.

70
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:22,335
You might want to inquire
at a local methadone clinic.

71
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,402
Why do you say that?

72
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,672
I think it's a pretty safe bet
your victim here was a junkie.

73
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:28,407
"Monkey on my back," is a
common term for heroin addiction.

74
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:33,412
1:16 is probably a sobriety date, which
a lot of addicts tattoo on their bodies.

75
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,892
If he got sober with
the help of methadone,

76
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:37,016
maybe somebody at a
clinic would recognize him.

77
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,684
Of course, I don't want to..

78
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,745
Contradict the expert.

79
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,556
I'm here about your son, Mrs. Baker.

80
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:54,925
What's Jared done now?

81
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:57,560
Well, he's listed you
as his emergency contact

82
00:03:57,561 --> 00:04:02,346
on his intake form at the
7th street methadone clinic.

83
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:05,743
Your son's body was found
yesterday in the forest preserve.

84
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:10,604
It appears he was
murdered. I'm.. Very sorry.

85
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,240
Thank you for bringing
me the news in person.

86
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:25,421
I always thought I would get a
call in the middle of the night.

87
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,582
You were expecting this?

88
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,033
I tried everything..

89
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:33,594
Therapists, rehab, a
clinic in Switzerland.

90
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,508
But when he turned 21 and came
into his grandfather's trust,

91
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:44,646
he had money for all the
drugs he could possibly desire.

92
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:47,406
When was the last time you saw him?

93
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:49,809
Four months ago, maybe five.

94
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,065
Okay.

95
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,281
And do you know where he was living?

96
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:55,569
With some kind of religious cult.

97
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,505
It bled him of every
last cent he had left.

98
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,454
He said he found the voice of God

99
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:05,115
and was finally getting clean.

100
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:10,636
Some good the voice of God did him.

101
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:13,277
It's called Haven House.

102
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:15,122
Looks like some sort of commune.

103
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:17,352
It's all centered around this kid..

104
00:05:17,353 --> 00:05:18,715
Kyle Jensen.

105
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:21,047
16 years old.

106
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:23,229
They say he talks directly to God.

107
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,590
And your victim gave all
his money to this wacko cult?

108
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,260
Almost $500,000.

109
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,379
What?!

110
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,369
That's the way it works.

111
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,524
Everyone who joins gives
every dime they have.

112
00:05:32,525 --> 00:05:34,703
It's a haven, all right, for
anybody with money in the bank

113
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:36,753
and no brain in their skull.

114
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:40,008
I swear, it.. It.. It.. It staggers me.

115
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:43,737
Millennium after millennium, no matter
how many of these charlatans are unmasked..

116
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:46,112
People keep shoveling gold into
the pockets of the next crook

117
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:50,034
who claims to speak in the name of
some nonexistent Santa Claus in the sky.

118
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:50,944
It's unbelievable.

119
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,613
I thought you'd be interested.

120
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:53,692
Do you want to tag along?

121
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:56,453
Try and stop me.

122
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:15,960
Hi. Are you here for Kyle?

123
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,164
He'll be talking to everybody
in just a couple of minutes.

124
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:19,763
We're with the FBI.

125
00:06:19,764 --> 00:06:22,097
The FBI? Is there something wrong?

126
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:24,568
We'd like to talk to
whoever's in charge.

127
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:26,724
Well, nobody's really in charge.

128
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:30,581
Um, this is Tom and Sandy's house,
but they're in with Kyle right now.

129
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:32,263
Could this wait till he's finished?

130
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:36,676
He really likes to tell us what God said
to him while it's still fresh in his head.

131
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:39,850
Any chance we could listen to
the word of God while we wait?

132
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:42,791
Everyone is welcome.

133
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:46,790
Behave yourself, Daniel.

134
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,418
It's wonderful to see all of you here.

135
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,139
So many new faces here today.

136
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,734
I'm Tom Shelby, and, uh,
this is my wife, Sandy.

137
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:56,467
Hi, everybody.

138
00:06:56,468 --> 00:06:57,963
And, uh..

139
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:00,173
These are the two boys I was
lucky enough to get in the

140
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:02,780
package deal when I married her..

141
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,240
Greg and Kyle.

142
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:07,047
Uh, now, as much as I'd
like to believe otherwise,

143
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:09,267
I know you didn't come
to hear me flap my jaw,

144
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:12,883
so I'm gonna shut up and
turn the floor over to Kyle.

145
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:14,744
Hmm.

146
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:21,082
Thanks, Tom. Um..

147
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:25,217
God picks the craziest times to tap
me on the shoulder and start talking.

148
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:28,032
Today, it was while I was doing the
dishes, and I want to apologize to my Mom

149
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:32,369
for the pitcher I dropped
when I checked out.

150
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,318
Today, God talked to me about doubt.

151
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:38,409
And how important it is for
us not to be scared of it.

152
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,766
He said he gave us doubt
so that we'd always be

153
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,111
trying to figure out
how things really work,

154
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:45,530
you know, and how we
can make them better.

155
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,098
Now, there are people in
this room who have no doubt.

156
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,388
And that is a beautiful thing.

157
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:57,289
But God also talked to me about how being
too sure of anything can be dangerous.

158
00:07:57,402 --> 00:08:01,665
And there is somebody
here who has only doubt..

159
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:05,206
Who doesn't believe at all.

160
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,039
But I'm really glad he's here.

161
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:28,717
Jared was such a beautiful person.

162
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:31,011
When was the last time you saw him?

163
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,689
About 6:00 just yesterday morning.

164
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,892
He.. He went out on his jog.

165
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:38,643
And you didn't wonder why he
didn't come home last night?

166
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,131
No. Everybody here is
free to come and go.

167
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:43,606
- Okay.
- I was worried, actually.

168
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:47,336
He said he'd been seeing his old friends
from K-town, where he used to score.

169
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:51,350
I.. I was scared that he
might be going back to drugs.

170
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:54,433
Did he mention any of
these old friends by name?

171
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:55,757
Mm. No.

172
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:57,012
Shane.

173
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:59,014
- Who?
- Shane Flannery.

174
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,394
Um he used to live here.

175
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:04,307
Well, turned out, he
was kind of a fanatic.

176
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:06,750
He didn't think we were
doing enough to protect Kyle.

177
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:09,626
He thought we were letting
in the scum of the Earth..

178
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:12,194
Addicts and prostitutes
and all kinds of sinners.

179
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:14,017
That's who comes in
need of God's healing.

180
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:16,765
Shane threatened to burn
us all alive in the house.

181
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:20,836
Jared asked him to leave, and when
he refused, Jared threw him out.

182
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:25,261
Yeah, and when he left, he was ranting
about Jared paying for his sins.

183
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:27,455
Okay. Well, we'll
certainly look into it.

184
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:29,978
Jared Baker signed over his
entire trust fund to you.

185
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:31,938
Half a million dollars.

186
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,222
What'd you do with the money?

187
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:35,112
Everything we take in
goes to the shelter,

188
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:37,790
the food bank, or the
school in Afghanistan.

189
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,655
Did Jared ever question how you
were spending his inheritance?

190
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:42,440
I.. I don't know what
you're insinuating.

191
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,069
If you're implying that we
had something to do with..

192
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,770
Tom, it's okay.

193
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:51,642
People give us their money because of
the first thing God ever said to me.

194
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:55,561
"I only ask for one thing.. Everything".

195
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:58,810
"But in exchange, I give everything".

196
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:00,496
I came here with nothing..

197
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:02,514
Just a coke habit and a lot of fear..

198
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:05,670
And these people took
me in like a daughter.

199
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,739
And God kept his promise.

200
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,499
He gave me everything.

201
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,692
Even the man that I'm going to marry.

202
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,424
You need to find Shane Flannery.

203
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:21,065
If he did kill Jared Baker,
he might kill somebody else.

204
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,832
Yes. Shane Flannery.

205
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,878
Uh-huh. I'm e-mailing a
photo and a description.

206
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,490
I want every man on it we can spare.

207
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:32,764
Great.

208
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,366
I'm gonna stick around.
I want to talk to Kyle.

209
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,635
About what?

210
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:41,536
I'm just curious about something.

211
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,295
Kyle?

212
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,705
Do you have a minute?

213
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:49,626
Sure.

214
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:54,753
How did you know that
I was a nonbeliever?

215
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:58,294
Did, uh, God tell you that?

216
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,568
I could just see it in your face.

217
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:04,495
It takes work not to believe
in God, and the effort shows.

218
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:07,799
I think it takes a lot more effort
to believe in something you can't see.

219
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,500
Are you kidding?

220
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:17,673
How could anybody look
at something so perfect

221
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:21,409
and beautiful and delicious and think
that it got that way by accident?

222
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,481
Well, there's a scientific
answer to that, Kyle.

223
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,331
Earlier versions of the raspberry
weren't so beautiful and delicious,

224
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:29,183
so they couldn't attract enough
birds to spread their seeds around.

225
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:31,644
I know how evolution works.

226
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:33,513
I love Darwin.

227
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:35,244
He was the first person in history

228
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:40,312
to look behind the curtain and see
how God actually makes it all work.

229
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:44,753
When did God first start talking to you?

230
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:47,705
When I was 12.

231
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,073
But you're not fooling me.

232
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:52,513
I know you think I'm either totally
full of it or just plain crazy.

233
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:55,304
And so did my parents, at first.

234
00:11:55,305 --> 00:12:01,205
W.. What does it feel like
when you're hearing God's voice?

235
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,654
It's beautiful.

236
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,949
Everything kind of disappears.

237
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,913
It's like I'm asleep and
awake at the same time.

238
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:10,787
Do you get headaches when that happens?

239
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:12,079
Feel nauseated?

240
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,123
Yeah. How did you know?

241
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:16,358
Just a hunch.

242
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:19,016
Well, anyway, it's totally worth it

243
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:23,134
because I also get this
amazing, like, euphoria.

244
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:24,476
Hmm.

245
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:28,095
Headaches, nausea, euphoria, voices..

246
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:31,556
These are classic symptoms
of temporal lobe epilepsy,

247
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:33,203
which could be caused by a tumor.

248
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:34,477
I.. I don't understand.

249
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:37,754
He has a check-up every year, and
his Doctor has never said anything.

250
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:39,739
Did you ever take him to a neurologist?

251
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,702
There was no reason to.
He's in perfect health.

252
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:43,943
I'm sorry, but he's not.

253
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:47,238
This kind of tumor can also press
on neighboring areas of the brain.

254
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:49,488
It can be life-threatening
if it's not treated,

255
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:51,851
of Kyle could have a
seizure while he's driving.

256
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:53,366
I'd like to bring him in for some tests.

257
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:56,923
And if they show what I think
they'll show, he may need surgery.

258
00:12:56,924 --> 00:12:58,735
Well, I.. I could bring
him in tomorrow when..

259
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,906
Mom, wait.

260
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:04,819
Are you saying this condition is
what's making me hear God's voice?

261
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,423
It's not God, Kyle.

262
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:08,435
It's a neurological abnormality.

263
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:10,631
Well, if it is, God
must have given it to me

264
00:13:10,632 --> 00:13:11,985
so he could have a way to talk to me.

265
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:13,984
I'm not getting rid of it.

266
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:15,808
This could be a fatal condition.

267
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:17,584
Being alive is a fatal condition.

268
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:19,546
- Kyle.
- I'm not doing it, Mom.

269
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:22,807
Mrs. Shelby, I understand
Kyle's commitment to his beliefs,

270
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:26,119
but he is still a minor. You
can compel him to get treatment.

271
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,621
Dr. Pierce, we'll
discuss what you've said.

272
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:29,713
We'll talk to Kyle about it.

273
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:35,614
But we are not gonna force him
to do anything against his will.

274
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:47,213
This is child abuse!

275
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:49,747
They're not forcing him to get tested
because they don't want the goose

276
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:51,433
to stop laying the golden eggs.

277
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:53,085
It's what I've always said.. Religion.

278
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:55,426
And, you know, if it's not
about blood or oppression,

279
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:57,207
it's about money in the bank.

280
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:02,029
That is a gross generalization,
not to mention totally offensive.

281
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,989
I mean, what about the Dalai Lama or..

282
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,408
Or Martin Luther King?

283
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08,964
Or the Inquisition or
9/11 or Giordano Bruno?

284
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:10,587
- Who?
- Oh, they didn't teach you about him

285
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,180
in Sunday school? 1592..

286
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:14,769
Giordano Bruno makes
the wild, satanic claim

287
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,572
that the Earth revolves around the
sun, so the Holy Fathers pray to God

288
00:14:18,573 --> 00:14:20,830
and are told that this
wicked man must die.

289
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:23,999
They clamp his tongue to the roof of
his mouth, and they burn him alive,

290
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,043
which must have been the right thing
to do because God told them to do it.

291
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:31,842
Look, yes, that is a horrible story, but
Haven House isn't burning people alive.

292
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:35,061
You made a snap diagnosis after
talking to that kid for five minutes.

293
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:38,548
You don't think that that might be
your prejudice against religion talking?

294
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:40,566
I.. I didn't make the condition up.

295
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,264
- It's what Joan of Arc had.
- What?

296
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:44,645
Joan of Arc had temporal lobe epilepsy.

297
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:46,964
It's why she thought that
Angels were talking to her.

298
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:48,848
Oh, did you examine her, too?

299
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:50,823
It's the conclusion
of medical historians

300
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,959
based on her description
of her own experience.

301
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,191
And we all know what happened to her.

302
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:57,791
Yes. She became a great
leader. She liberated France.

303
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,282
She was burned at the stake at age 19.

304
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:03,646
She was a deluded girl whose
illness led to her disaster.

305
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:05,096
She was a hero.

306
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:09,671
At a time when women had less power
than farm animals, she led an army.

307
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:11,366
I used to carry her
medal when I was a kid,

308
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,839
and I still light candles
in church for her on Sunday.

309
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,292
- You still go to church?
- Yes, Daniel, I do.

310
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:18,379
And I pray, too, if you want to know.

311
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,407
Why?

312
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:21,226
Because I believe in God.

313
00:15:21,227 --> 00:15:23,510
It comforts me to talk
to him about my problems.

314
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,928
And does he answer you
back like he does with Kyle?

315
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:29,846
Okay. You know what? I do not have time
to get into a theological debate with you.

316
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,330
I need to find Shane Flannery.

317
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:35,021
Which is exactly what our friends
at Haven House want you to be doing.

318
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:38,229
How do you know that Jared Baker
didn't just get pissed off one day

319
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,804
that his entire trust fund
was going into their pockets,

320
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:42,848
so he tried to get it back,
and they offed him for it?

321
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:45,288
Because the I.R.S. is
all over places like that.

322
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,301
Oh, and nothing ever
gets past Uncle Sam.

323
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:51,282
All right, fine, if it would make you feel
better, I will put in a call to the I.R.S.

324
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,703
But my money is on Shane.

325
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,731
I was exactly where you are, Dr. Pierce.

326
00:15:59,732 --> 00:16:03,021
I was positive a place raking in that
kind of cash had to be a scam but..

327
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:05,507
I've been tearing their books
apart at the seams for two years.

328
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:06,990
And I got to tell you, it's legit.

329
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:09,689
We're talking about millions of
dollars. Where is it all going?

330
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,495
Well, about 2% goes to administrative
expenses, which is as low

331
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:16,288
as it gets in nonprofit-land,
and some goes to local charities..

332
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,939
Food bank, meals on wheels, shelter.

333
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,574
Biggest chunk goes to
the school in Afghanistan.

334
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:23,483
- Moretti.
- Isn't it possible they're fooling you?

335
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,684
That.. That they're cooking the books?

336
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:30,143
I'd like to think, after 20 years in this
place, that I'm a pretty hard guy to fool.

337
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:33,266
CPD just found our suspect.

338
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:35,123
Thank you.

339
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:39,628
Mr. Flannery, did you threaten
to burn down Haven House,

340
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:41,279
send all its residents to hell?

341
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,576
I spoke the truth.

342
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:47,603
I said that God would bring the fire
of his vengeance down on that house.

343
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:51,073
Did you specifically
threaten to kill Jared Baker?

344
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:54,325
It was God who delivered
his judgment on that heretic.

345
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:56,398
Okay. Where were you
last Tuesday morning?

346
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,821
Across the street from Haven
House, guarding the chosen one..

347
00:16:58,822 --> 00:16:59,826
I was there all night.

348
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:01,465
Can anyone verify that?

349
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:04,833
Only God, who will purify
all the sinners in that house

350
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,681
with the fires of his vengeance..

351
00:17:07,682 --> 00:17:11,116
Starting with those who trample
on the seventh commandment.

352
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,284
Okay, I'm a little
rusty on my commandments,

353
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:15,358
but I think I remember
which one the seventh is.

354
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,892
Now, who in the house
was committing adultery?

355
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:20,603
That lying whore Nikki.

356
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:22,286
She's engaged to Kyle's brother,

357
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:26,456
so why was she rutting like
a sow with the dead man?

358
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:31,775
Okay, so, you're saying Nikki was
rutting like a sow with Jared Baker?

359
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:33,348
It was after midnight.

360
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:35,602
I saw the light go on in his window.

361
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:38,908
She came into his room
and took him in her arms.

362
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,891
Maybe Kyle's brother saw what I saw.

363
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:45,233
Maybe God entrusted him with
the fire of his vengeance.

364
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:48,354
He is not the killer.

365
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,617
Have you ever met a Holy Warrior
who shot his victim in the back?

366
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:56,179
Normally, they burn their
victims or crucify them

367
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,253
or ritually drain their blood.

368
00:17:59,254 --> 00:18:02,194
She's chasing the wrong cat.

369
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:05,631
I was sent to help you
catch the right one.

370
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:08,020
What do you mean, "sent"? Who sent you?

371
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:10,661
God, of course.

372
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:14,089
Messenger of God.

373
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,961
French accent.

374
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,614
Late Medieval, homespun Tunic.

375
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,392
Great.

376
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:22,608
I'm hallucinating Joan of Arc.

377
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,769
Enchanté.

378
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,463
Evil is in the eye of the beholder.

379
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:36,060
Especially if that
beholder is Shane Flannery.

380
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:39,089
So, you admit that you were
in Jared's room that night?

381
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,241
Yes, but not for anything sinful.

382
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:43,669
Jared needed my help.

383
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,103
At 2:00 in the morning?

384
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:46,692
My room is right next door to his.

385
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,680
I woke up. I heard him crying.

386
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:50,847
I was worried, so I went
and knocked on his door.

387
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:53,966
Do you think that your fiancé might
have seen you knock on his door?

388
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,429
No. Greg.. Greg's room
is downstairs in the back.

389
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,454
Jared was in a terrible state.

390
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,205
He told me he had been
seeing his friends in K-town

391
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:04,793
and that he was worried he might slip.

392
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:07,609
So we prayed together. I held him.

393
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,226
He read that the wrong
way and made a pass at me.

394
00:19:10,227 --> 00:19:14,187
I told him I would never betray
Greg, and I went back to my room.

395
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,415
Why didn't you tell
us any of this before?

396
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,796
I told you that I thought
Jared was having a rough time.

397
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:23,592
I didn't tell you the rest
because Greg loved Jared.

398
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:28,333
It would have only
upset him, and for what?

399
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:34,714
Hey. I heard you guys were back.

400
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,232
- Did you find Shane?
- Yes.

401
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:40,000
- But we don't think he did it.
- Daniel.

402
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:43,858
We're not really supposed to
discuss an open investigation.

403
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:45,895
Well, what were you
talking to Nikki about?

404
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:47,297
Does she know something?

405
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:49,112
Kyle, I..

406
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:51,033
Okay.

407
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,645
Dr. Pierce, can I talk
to you for a minute?

408
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:55,888
Not about the case.

409
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:58,949
I'll be in the car.

410
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:02,607
What's on your mind?

411
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:11,313
A while ago, God told me I wasn't
gonna be alive for very long.

412
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,681
I guess he's saying
the same thing you are.

413
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:16,411
You know I don't believe in God, Kyle.

414
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:18,736
But if a gut instinct is
telling you you're not well,

415
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:21,638
you should listen to
it and get treatment.

416
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,749
I'm not doing that.

417
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,347
I just want to know how
long I have so I can..

418
00:20:27,348 --> 00:20:29,611
You know, make plans.

419
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,248
Your condition isn't always fatal.

420
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:35,325
And there's no way to
predict how long it'll take

421
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:37,882
any illness to cause someone's death.

422
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:40,834
So, science doesn't
have all the answers?

423
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:43,398
I suppose not.

424
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:45,200
That's okay.

425
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:47,386
Neither does God.

426
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:51,444
He spends most of his time trying to figure
out why we do the crazy things we do.

427
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:54,196
That's why he made brain
scientists like you..

428
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:56,217
To help him figure it all out.

429
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:59,008
Hey. Sorry to interrupt. I
need to get back to the office.

430
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,016
What's going on?

431
00:21:01,017 --> 00:21:03,164
CPD found a witness in K-town

432
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:05,955
who said they saw a guy roughing
up Jared Baker a few days ago.

433
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:07,710
We're looking for him now.

434
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,472
Listen, um..

435
00:21:09,473 --> 00:21:12,945
Call me anytime about your health or..

436
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:14,308
Just to talk.

437
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,850
Thanks.

438
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:18,431
I'll do that.

439
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:23,659
How could such an intelligent,
level-headed kid be so Medieval at heart?

440
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,705
Not to mention Kate.

441
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:30,354
Daniel, that man who's music you're
playing was a devout believer.

442
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,904
Bach lived 300 years ago.
Science was in the cradle.

443
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:36,540
Isn't science just another kind of faith

444
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,875
with its own scriptures
and its own dogmas?

445
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:40,389
Science is based on fact.

446
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,110
It must be exhausting to
be so cynical all the time.

447
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:46,615
It's not cynicism.. It's reality.

448
00:21:46,616 --> 00:21:49,938
And, of course, we all know what
a firm grip you have on reality.

449
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:51,241
Oh, that's very funny.

450
00:21:51,242 --> 00:21:53,323
I think you're jealous
of people with faith.

451
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:57,168
You wish you could find that
kind of solace and comfort.

452
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:59,146
Listen to that treble.

453
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:02,278
Hmm? Like a chicken
screaming for its life.

454
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,039
I've seen you looking longingly
at a satin-finish ebony grand

455
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,057
in the Steinway showroom downtown.

456
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:12,401
Yeah, well, that particular satin-finish
ebony grand costs as much as most cars.

457
00:22:12,402 --> 00:22:15,463
Daniel, you just got
a check for $50,000.

458
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:18,264
You can buy anything you want with it.

459
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:20,203
That would be an insane indulgence.

460
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:23,281
You've done crazier things.

461
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:25,023
You really think I should buy it?

462
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,611
Hey, Doc. Kyle Jensen's
Mother is on the phone.

463
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,852
She sounds pretty upset.

464
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,175
Kyle runs up and down
those stairs 20 times a day.

465
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:38,432
He must have gone into one
of his trances and fallen.

466
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:40,972
Why would God choose a moment like that?

467
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:43,102
Mr. and Mrs. Shelby..

468
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:45,677
Kyle suffered a major
head trauma in the fall,

469
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:47,705
causing his brain to bleed.

470
00:22:47,706 --> 00:22:50,191
In a way, the fall may have
been fortunate because the scan

471
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:54,144
revealed something we might not
have caught until it was too late.

472
00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:58,364
Kyle has an invasive tumor
in his left temporal lobe.

473
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:00,209
It's possible the fall dislodged it,

474
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,446
which is what's causing
the severe bleeding.

475
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:05,320
Lord in heaven.

476
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:07,055
That's what you told us yesterday.

477
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:08,654
We should have listened
to you. We should have..

478
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:10,617
We should have brought him in for tests.

479
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:14,139
I need to operate immediately to
relieve the pressure from the bleeding.

480
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,579
If we can remove the tumor, we will.

481
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,595
Kyle made it clear that he
didn't want to do anything

482
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:20,214
that might cut him off from God.

483
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:23,366
You can't leave a dislodged
tumor inside your son's brain.

484
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,913
I'm just thinking of
what Kyle would want.

485
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:26,446
You might as well shoot him in the head!

486
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,276
Daniel.

487
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:29,677
Dr. Pierce is right.

488
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:33,698
I know Kyle may be angry with me,

489
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:37,113
but I am not going to lose my son.

490
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:40,654
We'll prep him for surgery.

491
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,370
Doctor, did..

492
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:45,388
Did Kyle have elevated
Prolactin levels when he came in?

493
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:48,964
No. They were normal, but
need to get started, so..

494
00:23:48,965 --> 00:23:50,705
What was that about?

495
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:53,240
Elevated Prolactin would
mean that Kyle had a seizure

496
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:55,298
in the last couple of
hours, but he didn't.

497
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,701
So he didn't fall because
he went into a trance.

498
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,103
Maybe he figured out who killed Jared.

499
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:03,284
And someone pushed him.

500
00:24:13,257 --> 00:24:16,186
Did any of you see Kyle fall?

501
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:18,636
I was in the den,
reading, and.. And, uh..

502
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:20,991
Heard a crash and ran into the foyer.

503
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,254
Jake and Tina came to my room
and told me what happened.

504
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:27,849
I was making dinner, and
I heard Tom yell for help.

505
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,494
When I saw him on the
ground, all that blood, I..

506
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:32,529
Excuse me.

507
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,797
Moretti.

508
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:35,972
Why's she asking all these questions?

509
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,136
Nobody in the house
would want to hurt Kyle.

510
00:24:38,137 --> 00:24:39,507
Are you sure about that?

511
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:41,548
Daniel.

512
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:46,102
They found the guy who
beat up Jared in K-town.

513
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:48,153
- We got to go.
- What about Kyle?

514
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,119
Well, the family will call
us if there's any news.

515
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,614
No, I mean about protecting him.

516
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,643
Somebody tried to kill
him. They may try again.

517
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:55,103
You.. You got to put a guard on him.

518
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:57,113
Daniel, I'm not gonna be able
to get approval for a guard

519
00:24:57,114 --> 00:25:02,168
on a hospital room 24/7 just because
we have an unsubstantiated theory.

520
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,831
Well, I'm staying.

521
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:07,112
All right.

522
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:10,221
Are you saying that
I killed Jared Baker?

523
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:12,545
Witnesses saw you two
get into a shoving match

524
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:15,131
a few days before he was murdered.

525
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:17,055
Look, I do outreach for the V.A.

526
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,528
And we get a lot of these vets
living on the street around here.

527
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:22,283
So, yeah, it pisses me off
when these jackasses come down

528
00:25:22,284 --> 00:25:25,264
and try to scam these guys
out of their SDI checks.

529
00:25:25,265 --> 00:25:27,476
Jared Baker was scamming veterans?

530
00:25:27,477 --> 00:25:31,794
Passing out pamphlets, hawking some church
that's about donating every cent they got..

531
00:25:31,795 --> 00:25:34,784
So I tossed his pamphlets and told
him to take his scam elsewhere.

532
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:39,262
And then when he didn't get
the message, you got physical.

533
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:41,488
After he took off, I felt
bad about the whole thing,

534
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:44,427
so I fished one of the pamphlets
out of the trash and took a look.

535
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:46,429
And guess what.. I was right.

536
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:50,058
It's all a big fake.. At least
the school in Afghanistan is.

537
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,803
That place does not exist.

538
00:25:52,804 --> 00:25:54,445
How do you know that?

539
00:25:54,446 --> 00:25:55,772
Picture in the pamphlet.

540
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:57,994
Schoolkids in front of a big lake?

541
00:25:57,995 --> 00:25:59,645
School's supposed to be in Maimana.

542
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:03,046
I was stationed in Herat,
a stone's throw from there.

543
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:06,150
There's no lake in
that valley, just sand.

544
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:07,250
This picture?

545
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,171
Yeah.

546
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:12,155
See the writing on the blackboard?

547
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:13,286
That's Farsi.

548
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:14,918
In Maimana, they speak Arabic.

549
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:16,715
I called a bunch of guys
who served over there.

550
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:18,515
Nobody ever heard of
an international group

551
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:21,298
operating a school
anywhere near Maimana.

552
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,565
You report this to anyone?

553
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:25,437
Just Jared Baker.

554
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:27,070
Wait. Jared knew?

555
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:30,883
Next time he came down to K-town, I
told him exactly what I just told you.

556
00:26:30,884 --> 00:26:32,730
How did he take it?

557
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:35,079
It shook him up. He said he
wanted to report it to somebody,

558
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,213
so I told him he should
start with the I.R.S.

559
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:42,614
The I.R.S. gave Haven House
a clean bill of health.

560
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:58,411
Last-minute vacation, Ethan?

561
00:26:59,655 --> 00:27:03,038
We removed the tumor
and stopped the bleeding.

562
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,792
But there were complications.

563
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:08,670
Kyle suffered a ruptured aneurysm.

564
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:10,598
He's in a coma.

565
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,030
Oh, my God.

566
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:17,791
- Will he be all right?
- The situation doesn't look good.

567
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:20,548
Could he die?

568
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:24,661
I think you need to prepare
yourselves for that possibility.

569
00:27:24,662 --> 00:27:27,002
I'm sorry.

570
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:32,163
- Can we see him?
- Sure. I'll take you in.

571
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:47,254
It is a pity..

572
00:27:47,255 --> 00:27:49,779
N'est-ce pas?

573
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,405
They call you "the messenger," right?

574
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:55,565
Well, I want you to
deliver a message to God.

575
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:57,080
I thought you don't believe in him.

576
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:58,462
I don't.

577
00:27:58,463 --> 00:28:03,698
But you do, so I want you to tell him
from me that I think he's an asshole

578
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:06,619
that is blasphemy, Daniel. It is a sin.

579
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,054
No. No. No.

580
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:11,524
A sin.. A sin is giving
a brain tumor to a..

581
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:14,574
To a kid who's never done
a bad thing in his life.

582
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:19,268
A sin is letting whoever killed Jared
Baker run free while that boy lies dying.

583
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:21,944
Does.. What does.. Does God enjoy this?

584
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:24,248
Watching mothers sobbing their eyes out?

585
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:25,722
What is that, his thing?

586
00:28:25,723 --> 00:28:27,081
Is that entertaining to him?

587
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:31,650
What are we? Is that what we
are.. Some sort of entertainment?

588
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:34,920
Give him the message. T.. Tell
him. Go on. Tell him.. Tell him..

589
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,221
Tell him to go to hell.

590
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:41,494
That audit is accurate to
the best of my knowledge.

591
00:28:41,495 --> 00:28:45,256
What about your knowledge of the seven
cash deposits made into your account,

592
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:49,478
each in the amount of
$9,900, just a squeak below

593
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,077
what the bank would
be required to report?

594
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:53,876
I won that money playing poker.

595
00:28:53,877 --> 00:28:55,084
I see.

596
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:57,100
And with your poker
winnings, you decided to

597
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,384
buy yourself a one-way
ticket to the Maldives,

598
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:04,360
a country that just happens to have no
extradition treaty with The United States?

599
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:06,926
I always wanted to go there.

600
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:10,002
Jail is nothing like
the Maldives, Ethan.

601
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:12,917
There are no crystal-clear
waters, no palm trees,

602
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:17,838
no waiters fetching you
brightly colored drinks.

603
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:23,525
I want full immunity.

604
00:29:23,526 --> 00:29:25,770
That's not gonna happen.

605
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:29,366
But if you give me the name of whoever
bribed you to falsify this audit,

606
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:34,040
I'll ask the Judge to let you plead
down to receiving improper benefits.

607
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:37,821
You'd get off with six months.

608
00:29:37,835 --> 00:29:39,541
This offer expires in 10 seconds.

609
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:41,522
Nine..

610
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:43,705
Eight..

611
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,941
Three..

612
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:47,702
Okay, okay, okay.

613
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:51,599
I took a bribe.

614
00:29:52,418 --> 00:29:54,638
Who from?

615
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:12,912
Mr. Shelby, could I speak
to you in the hallway?

616
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,415
What's this about?

617
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:16,724
It would be best if we spoke outside.

618
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:20,412
Anything you have to say, you
can say in front of my family.

619
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:22,760
I'm placing you under arrest
for the murder of Jared Baker.

620
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:24,715
- What are you talking about?
- That's insane!

621
00:30:24,716 --> 00:30:27,371
- You have the right to remain silent.
- No, let go of him!

622
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:29,244
- Sandy, don't.
- I'm coming with you.

623
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,648
No. Stay here with Kyle.

624
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:32,728
I can stay here with
Kyle. Greg, take your Mom.

625
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:34,734
No, everybody stay here, please.

626
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:36,526
God knows the truth.
He'll set everything right.

627
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:40,346
Do you understand these rights
as they have been read to you?

628
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:42,390
So, how do you.. How
do you know Tom did it?

629
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:44,380
Picked up the I.R.S.
auditor on his way to the

630
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:46,861
airport with a one-way
ticket to the Maldives.

631
00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:48,796
Said Tom bribed him for a clean audit.

632
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:50,264
You were right. Tom was
pocketing all the money.

633
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,466
Okay, but why kill Jared?

634
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:52,741
Well, Jared was on to the scam.

635
00:30:52,742 --> 00:30:54,716
Tom found that out the
night before the murder.

636
00:30:54,717 --> 00:30:56,634
Look, we got to get going. I'll
tell you all about it in the car.

637
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:59,926
W.. W.. You're sure that
no one else is in on it?

638
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:02,850
Until you're sure,
I'm staying with Kyle.

639
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:04,337
Why would I kill Jared? I loved him.

640
00:31:04,338 --> 00:31:08,181
We got a warrant to search
your house, including your safe,

641
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:11,920
and we found records of the cash
payments you made to the I.R.S. auditor.

642
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:13,843
I swear to God I never
gave him anything.

643
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:17,653
He told us about how you did your research
on him when he first started the audit.

644
00:31:17,654 --> 00:31:20,044
You knew that he had
alimony, gambling debts.

645
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,514
You knew that if you offered him a bribe
for a clean audit, that he'd take it.

646
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:24,284
He's lying.

647
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:27,591
We also found the incorporation
documents for the shell organization

648
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:29,749
that runs the fake
school in Afghanistan.

649
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,773
What are you talking
about? The school is real.

650
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:34,037
The State Department has no record

651
00:31:34,038 --> 00:31:37,260
of a foreign charity
operating a school in Maimana.

652
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:39,330
We send them almost $1 million a year.

653
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:41,804
No, you send almost $1 million a year

654
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:44,690
to an account in your
name at the Bank of Kabul.

655
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:48,509
From Kabul, it's transferred to
the ever-popular Cayman Islands.

656
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,795
Now I know why you were so eager
to put us onto Shane Flannery.

657
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:53,085
No. I would never do that.

658
00:31:53,086 --> 00:31:54,717
You were raking it in like crazy,

659
00:31:54,718 --> 00:31:57,615
until Jared Baker found out
that the school was fake.

660
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,733
And he called Ethan over at the I.R.S.

661
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:02,268
Ethan called you and
said you had a problem.

662
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:05,813
And then, according to
Ethan, your exact words were..

663
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:08,942
"I'll take care of it".

664
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:11,703
I guess you did.

665
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:15,644
I need to find Tom a lawyer.

666
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:17,417
Sandy, let Greg make the calls.

667
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:18,460
You need to rest.

668
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:20,144
She's right, Mom. Let me take you home.

669
00:32:20,145 --> 00:32:21,827
No. I can't leave Kyle.

670
00:32:21,828 --> 00:32:24,749
I'll be right here. I'll call
you the second he wakes up.

671
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,450
I'll stay, too.

672
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,510
- Thank you, Nikki.
- Sure.

673
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,738
And thank you, Dr. Pierce.

674
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,729
Dr. Pierce, if it's all right..

675
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,553
I'd like some time alone..

676
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,615
To pray.

677
00:32:53,616 --> 00:32:56,634
Of course she wants time alone..

678
00:32:56,635 --> 00:32:59,056
Because as soon as you leave the room..

679
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:02,777
She is going to kill the boy.

680
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:09,364
Nikki, if it's all the same to you..

681
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:12,065
I'm gonna stay.

682
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:19,881
Look at her.

683
00:33:19,882 --> 00:33:23,369
The soul of piety and devotion.

684
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,062
But doesn't it bother you

685
00:33:25,063 --> 00:33:30,763
how eager she has been to
get everybody out of the room?

686
00:33:31,018 --> 00:33:35,560
The boy was very curious as
to why you were talking to her.

687
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:38,830
Maybe he had asked too many questions..

688
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:40,420
And she pushed him.

689
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:41,633
And think..

690
00:33:41,634 --> 00:33:44,537
Think of that tax man
flying off to the Maldives.

691
00:33:44,538 --> 00:33:47,101
Of all the countries in the world,

692
00:33:47,102 --> 00:33:50,220
why would he choose a
romantic tropical island?

693
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:55,021
Unless he wasn't planning
to go there alone.

694
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,240
Yes, she is very beautiful, no?

695
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:02,171
Just the perfect type of woman

696
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:05,516
a lonely tax man would
dream of running away with.

697
00:34:05,517 --> 00:34:07,798
That's still not proof.

698
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,605
What?

699
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:12,006
N.. nothing.

700
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:15,547
It's hardly enough to get
her burned at the stake,

701
00:34:15,548 --> 00:34:18,422
but it's more than
the British had on me.

702
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:24,323
Please, Dr. Pierce, I'd really
like some time alone with Kyle.

703
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:30,746
What are you going to do?

704
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,416
What? W.. What is that?

705
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:53,017
Why is it making that sound?

706
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,091
He's gone.

707
00:34:59,092 --> 00:35:01,216
Wh.. What are you talking
about? No. He's breathing.

708
00:35:01,217 --> 00:35:05,034
This monitors neuroelectrical activity.

709
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:07,538
Kyle's brain-dead.

710
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,317
Oh, my God.

711
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:13,458
I.. I.. I have to call his parents.

712
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:20,585
Oh, sorry. I must have, uh,
knocked this out by mistake.

713
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:28,713
- Moretti.
- Tom isn't the killer.

714
00:35:28,714 --> 00:35:30,125
- It's Nikki.
- What?

715
00:35:30,126 --> 00:35:31,302
She says she loves Kyle.

716
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:32,959
But when he died, she
didn't even look at him.

717
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,199
She just took off
like a bat out of hell.

718
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,825
Oh, my God. Kyle died?

719
00:35:35,826 --> 00:35:38,333
No, no, no, no. That
was just pretend. Wha..

720
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:39,833
Daniel, what are you talking about?

721
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:42,952
It was all Nikki. Killing Jared,
pushing Kyle down the stairs.

722
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:45,100
She's been waiting to get him
alone so she can finish the job.

723
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,139
You've got to stop her
before she leaves the country.

724
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,941
Do you have any proof of this?

725
00:35:48,942 --> 00:35:50,375
N.. N.. No, but..

726
00:35:50,376 --> 00:35:51,707
Okay, then we need to put a tail on her,

727
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:53,712
find out where she's
headed in such a hurry.

728
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:55,693
Right.

729
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:06,328
Hey, need a hand with those?

730
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:08,393
I already told you the whole story.

731
00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:12,008
The problem is that Nikki Atkins
is telling us a different version.

732
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:13,359
And in hers..

733
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,707
The Afghan scam, framing Tom
Shelby, murdering Jared Baker..

734
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,081
That was all you.

735
00:36:19,082 --> 00:36:24,025
She says you blackmailed
her into going along with it.

736
00:36:24,026 --> 00:36:25,654
You're making that up to trap me.

737
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:27,947
We picked her up at a bank
with two sacks full of cash.

738
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:29,618
Her next stop was the airport.

739
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:31,441
She had her boarding
pass all printed up.

740
00:36:31,442 --> 00:36:36,782
Yeah, see, except she was
not going to the Maldives.

741
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,431
It was all her.

742
00:36:46,432 --> 00:36:48,699
The scam, everything.

743
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,460
She killed Jared.

744
00:36:56,067 --> 00:37:01,347
I met her when I started
the audit on Haven House.

745
00:37:04,886 --> 00:37:07,213
I actually let myself believe..

746
00:37:07,214 --> 00:37:11,054
It was about more than business.

747
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:17,145
Once she was sure that she had
me, she told me about her scam,

748
00:37:17,146 --> 00:37:20,810
offered to cut me in 50/50 if
I made the audit come out clean.

749
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:23,154
How'd she get the con
going to begin with?

750
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:27,678
She heard about this place where
morons signed over fortunes and..

751
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,837
Didn't ask questions.

752
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:34,509
She showed up, pretending
to be a lost little lamb,

753
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:39,088
hooked up with the older brother
so she could be on the inside.

754
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:41,984
What about the school in
Afghanistan? Where'd that come from?

755
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:44,407
She scanned some pictures
from National Geographic,

756
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:50,172
put together a website, and
e-mailed Tom, asking for his help.

757
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:51,742
Seemed like we pulled it off.

758
00:37:51,743 --> 00:37:55,989
Until Jared Baker started asking
questions about the school in Afghanistan.

759
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,935
Yeah, after I talked to Jared,

760
00:37:58,936 --> 00:38:04,007
I called up Nikki, and I
told her we had a problem.

761
00:38:04,008 --> 00:38:06,997
Next day, Jared turns up dead.

762
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:08,982
I called her, and I said,
"what the hell is going on?

763
00:38:08,983 --> 00:38:11,055
No one's supposed to get hurt".

764
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:14,586
She told me to keep quiet
and to get out of town.

765
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:16,249
So I went home, and I got my bags.

766
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,173
You guys picked me up.

767
00:38:18,174 --> 00:38:21,733
And that is the entire story. I swear.

768
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:25,346
Just one problem.. It's
your word against hers.

769
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:30,027
I might be an idiot,
but I am not stupid.

770
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:32,962
Check the lining in my suitcase.

771
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:36,616
There's a flash drive with
some sound files on it.

772
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:38,576
One thing you learn when
you work for the I.R.S.

773
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:43,977
Your whole life is the value
of keeping good records.

774
00:38:45,017 --> 00:38:47,626
They aren't buying
that Shane killed Jared.

775
00:38:47,627 --> 00:38:49,761
Oh, baby, calm down.

776
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:50,944
Okay. We're going to be all right.

777
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:54,621
I've got the room all booked on the
most beautiful beach in the Maldives.

778
00:38:54,622 --> 00:38:57,443
Nikki, what's going on?
Who are you talking to?

779
00:38:57,444 --> 00:38:58,775
Hey. I.. I got to go.

780
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:00,970
No, I think Kyle heard me. Okay.

781
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,128
I love you.

782
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:03,601
I'll see you at the airport.

783
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:05,981
Kyle wanted to know why
you were talking to us.

784
00:39:05,982 --> 00:39:07,371
That's why he knocked on your door.

785
00:39:07,372 --> 00:39:11,367
But he overheard too much, and that's
why you pushed him down the stairs.

786
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:16,727
Do you think I don't know that a
sound recording can be manipulated?

787
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:21,888
Do you even know that
you're doing Satan's work?

788
00:39:22,261 --> 00:39:26,386
Please, God, I pray that you will
forgive these people for their blindness.

789
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:29,074
I pray that you will
show them the truth.

790
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,413
While you're at it, you might
want to also pray for a Judge

791
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:35,974
who doesn't believe
in the death penalty.

792
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,897
It's a miracle, really.

793
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:41,050
Kyle's awake and eating chocolate
pudding like there's no tomorrow.

794
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:42,478
How much tissue damage?

795
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:43,461
Some swelling.

796
00:39:43,462 --> 00:39:49,362
He'll need to take it easy for a while,
but he should make a good recovery.

797
00:39:55,547 --> 00:40:00,300
That message you sent God
must have done the trick.

798
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:02,576
Sometimes he needs a kick in the pants.

799
00:40:02,577 --> 00:40:05,207
People make amazing
recoveries all the time

800
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:08,286
with no help from
some nonexistent deity.

801
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:13,049
If he doesn't exist, then why
would you send him a message?

802
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:17,190
Because I'm a stark, raving lunatic.

803
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:21,017
Look, we are closing Haven House.

804
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:25,828
But we're keeping the broken promise,
opening a school in Afghanistan.

805
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:27,645
I know it's what God wants.

806
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:31,228
You're still hearing a voice
even after the operation?

807
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:34,462
Not an actual voice
in my head like before.

808
00:40:34,463 --> 00:40:37,351
But I still hear God every second..

809
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:41,792
The way anybody can if they just listen.

810
00:40:47,556 --> 00:40:49,476
Here.

811
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:56,973
Maybe this will buy a few
books for the new school.

812
00:40:57,861 --> 00:40:59,564
Wow!

813
00:40:59,565 --> 00:41:02,805
That's a lot of books.

814
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,296
Does this mean you believe in God now?

815
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:07,877
Absolutely not.

816
00:41:08,637 --> 00:41:11,757
But I believe in you.

817
00:41:12,331 --> 00:41:15,991
I got something for you, too.

818
00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:21,075
Kyle, what kind of present is that?

819
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:25,336
I think Dr. Pierce will appreciate it.
