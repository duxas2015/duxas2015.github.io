Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:02,928 --> 00:00:04,788
Hmm.

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:08,340
Check out this letter to the editor.

4
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:12,046
Apparently, you're not the only guy
who thinks big media and big business

5
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:14,244
are crushing the
humanity out of humanity.

6
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:16,645
I'm gonna crush the humanity out
of you if you don't stop talking.

7
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:20,031
No, seriously. Sounds like
you on one of your rants.

8
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:21,397
Listen to this.

9
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:25,434
"When you devote not even a single
page to anything other than your"

10
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:30,477
"slavishly fawning so-called 'news ',
pandering to corporate advertisers,"

11
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:36,378
"you destroy all hope of tomorrow
for honest, hardworking Americans".

12
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:40,050
"Wow! How intriguing, Max".

13
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,529
"Thank you for sharing something
you thought would interest me".

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,883
"Oh, and thank you so
much for the papaya".

15
00:00:44,884 --> 00:00:46,353
"It's delicious".

16
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:50,554
Actually, it could use a little lime.

17
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:52,892
You know what?

18
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:54,293
Get it yourself.

19
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:56,362
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me.

20
00:00:56,363 --> 00:01:01,588
And as of right now, your
assistant is officially on strike.

21
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:04,199
If this is about a raise,
you might want to consider

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,062
a slightly less melodramatic approach.

23
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:07,961
It's not about the money, Doc.

24
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:09,821
It's about the working conditions.

25
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:13,679
Okay, it's about you showing
me a little common courtesy.

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,315
What are you.. Lewicki!

27
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:21,416
All right, all right.
I'll read the damn letter.

28
00:01:34,898 --> 00:01:36,505
Who are you?

29
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:41,065
Oh, uh, I'm afraid my identity
is classified, old boy.

30
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:44,246
You're a hallucination.

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,907
Whose assistance you'll require if you
have any hope of cracking that code.

32
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:51,316
What code?

33
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:53,806
Come now, old boy.

34
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:57,307
Surely you noticed the awkward syntax.

35
00:01:57,308 --> 00:02:01,268
"Slavishly fawning so-called news"?

36
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:06,632
Clearly the words have been twisted
around some sort of hidden message.

37
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:10,353
- Holy sh..
- There's my boy.

38
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:12,438
It's steganography.

39
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,640
Hidden writing. Look.

40
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,477
If you read every 10th
word, look what you get.

41
00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:20,143
"You'll be proud of me".

42
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:24,765
"Front-page news tomorrow.
One down, four to go".

43
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:27,438
"The butcher told me where to start".

44
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,218
It's how The French
Resistance communicated

45
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,100
with British Intelligence
during World War II..

46
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:33,659
With messages in the newspaper,
right where anybody could see.

47
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,478
French resistance?

48
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,571
Wow.

49
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:40,365
Meanwhile, back on the plane of
reality, some of us have work to do.

50
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:42,237
Think about it, Kate.

51
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:44,003
What ends up on the front page?

52
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:46,107
- World news, politics..
- Or crime.

53
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:49,327
I'm guessing whoever wrote this is
sending a message to an accomplice.

54
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:51,088
"One down, four to go".. That could be..

55
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:53,456
What? Banks to rob
or victims to butcher.

56
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:56,990
Do you think that this might be you..

57
00:02:56,991 --> 00:03:00,612
Making connections where
possibly there aren't any?

58
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,849
What are the chances of every 10th word

59
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,885
in some random piece of
text making this much sense?

60
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:07,072
Or it could be something
completely innocent.

61
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:09,528
Then why hide it in a code?

62
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:11,373
Look at the guy's name.. James Smith.

63
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:13,381
It's got to be the most
common name in America.

64
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:14,655
It's obviously an alias.

65
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:17,884
And why use an alias unless
you're doing something illicit?

66
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:20,419
All right, look, the letter
probably came in via e-mail.

67
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,097
There might be some
way to trace the I.P.

68
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:24,376
But it could be from an
Internet cafe in Singapore.

69
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:26,662
You're actually taking this seriously?

70
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:30,103
I want to be there when you tell
the boss that we're taking on a case

71
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:35,205
that Dr. Strange found with
his secret decoder ring.

72
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:37,306
Moretti.

73
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:39,003
What?

74
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:41,730
Okay, we'll be right there.

75
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:45,324
That was the CPD. They need our help
with a possible terrorist attack.

76
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,801
A lawyer downtown opened up a package
and got sprayed in the face with Sarin.

77
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:50,803
Died before paramedics got there.

78
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:55,197
Of course, a lawyer, because the
butcher told him where to start.

79
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:56,509
What the hell are you talking about?

80
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,844
It's Shakespeare.. "Henry VI, part 2".

81
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:02,898
Dick the butcher says, "first thing
we do, let's kill all the lawyers".

82
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:04,965
A Sarin attack.

83
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:09,346
That sounds like front-page news to me.

84
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:21,118
Normally, I open Mr.
Scantlin's mail myself,

85
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,569
but there was a box marked "personal".

86
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,656
And, he thought someone sent him
a present, so he opened it himself.

87
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:31,079
And there was a pop, like a firecracker,

88
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,893
and some kind of spray came out.

89
00:04:33,894 --> 00:04:35,528
And he started twitching.

90
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,449
I tried to help him but..

91
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,644
There's nothing you could
have done, Miss Benowitz.

92
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,285
Sarin is more toxic than cyanide.

93
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:46,636
Can you think of anybody who
might have had a reason to do this?

94
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:49,906
Tom was a mensch. Everybody loved him.

95
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:53,917
But he was a trial lawyer.
He won a lot of cases.

96
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,688
I mean, the.. The losers weren't happy.

97
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,083
There is nothing on the package.
No prints, no return address.

98
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:04,191
All right, well, we'll talk to his
friends, relatives, acquaintances,

99
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:06,631
but I think we should
start with his case files.

100
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:08,899
Farrington v. Awakama Sushi.

101
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,843
Scantlin got Awakama for 7 mil
for a single case of E. Coli.

102
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:14,034
Here's something.

103
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:15,791
Miller v. Klausner extermination.

104
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:20,572
Klausner was ordered to pay $70,000 in
medical expenses, $1.4 million punitive.

105
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:22,170
This could be our guy.

106
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,644
Why him out of all these cases?

107
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:27,654
Sarin's a nerve Agent, but it was
originally developed as a pesticide.

108
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,038
An exterminator would have everything he

109
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,185
needed to mix up a
batch, right on the shelf.

110
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:35,322
Yeah. I hate Tom Scantlin.

111
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:37,190
I built my business from nothing.

112
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:40,152
32 trucks, 58 employees.

113
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:42,642
Contracts with every school
district in the County.

114
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,336
Not bad for a guy who never
got past eighth grade, huh?

115
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,577
And that S.O.B. took it all away.

116
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:50,459
Actually, it was a jury of your
peers who decided against you.

117
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,139
They decided wrong.

118
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,208
LBJ Elementary had roaches
the size of chipmunks.

119
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:59,023
So my guys sprayed with a very reliable
pesticide I imported from Mexico.

120
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:02,416
Which you had to do because it
wasn't yet approved here in the U.S.

121
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:04,130
They use that stuff
like ketchup on fries

122
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:05,834
South of the border,
and no one's complaining.

123
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:08,000
Someone North of the
border sure complained.

124
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,428
One kid cries sick,
and his parents get a

125
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:14,022
fast-talking lawyer who
sues the crap out of me.

126
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,639
On the news, he made it sound like I

127
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,380
deliberately set out to
poison schoolchildren.

128
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:24,866
You know, it's funny that
you should mention the news,

129
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:27,714
because there was a letter
to the editor in today's paper

130
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:31,311
about how the media is
stacked against the little guy.

131
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:34,477
You might find it interesting.

132
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,144
Go ahead. Read it.

133
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,384
Sorry, I don't have my reading glasses.

134
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:39,756
Maybe you don't need
to read it because you

135
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:41,669
already know what it
says because you wrote it.

136
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,324
What are you talking about? I
don't write letters to the papers.

137
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:47,214
Listen, just because I hated Scantlin
doesn't mean that I killed him.

138
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:53,115
Sorry to interrupt. I wanted to
offer Mr. Klausner reading glasses.

139
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,705
Yeah, uh, I probably got
a different prescription.

140
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:00,707
All right. I think I
understand what's going on.

141
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,264
Do.. Do you have Dyslexia, Mr. Klausner?

142
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:05,666
How did you..

143
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,749
It would help explain why a man
as smart as you didn't make it

144
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,306
past eighth grade, and why you
don't want to read the letter.

145
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:11,957
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

146
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,386
It just means you're not our man.

147
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:16,322
Just because he's dyslexic
doesn't mean he's innocent.

148
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:19,774
Probert, for him, words and
letters swim around the page.

149
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:22,348
So, sadly, he avoids reading
and writing altogether.

150
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:25,538
It's not like he suddenly woke up one
morning and decided to start communicating

151
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:28,787
by constructing elaborate codes
buried inside letters to the editor.

152
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:33,154
So it's back to the
needle-in-a-haystack strategy.

153
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:35,267
Actually, I've been thinking.

154
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:39,561
There may be a way to get
the needle to come to us.

155
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:43,834
In his code, the killer
says, "you'll be proud of me".

156
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:45,807
He's looking for approval.

157
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:47,638
If I write him back,
tell him what a great

158
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,104
job I think he's doing,
maybe he'll talk to me.

159
00:07:50,105 --> 00:07:52,872
You plan on making
friends with this lunatic?

160
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,309
We're peas in a pod.

161
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,673
"You think you have guts, but all
I hear is whining and self-pity".

162
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:02,058
What are you trying to do, get
him to Sarin-gas the whole city?

163
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:03,804
I thought this was
supposed to be a fan letter.

164
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,604
Have you considered
requesting a new partner?

165
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:07,194
You're just trying to
get his attention, right?

166
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:11,068
Exactly. If he's as smart as I think
he is, he'll see the hidden message.

167
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,429
Every 10 words, you said?

168
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:17,088
"Great move".

169
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:20,509
"I wish I had your guts".

170
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:23,939
"Just one question".

171
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,460
"Out of all the lying,
cheating lawyers, why that one?"

172
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:33,758
"Your friend, kindred spirit".

173
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:35,603
"Kindred spirit". I like that.

174
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:40,008
We should rush a copy of this to the paper
so they can get it in tomorrow's edition.

175
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,275
Maybe we could bring it over
there in a horse and buggy.

176
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:43,781
Is that supposed to be funny?

177
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:45,615
Listen, papers have online editions.

178
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:51,516
I'm just gonna post this as a
comment to the original letter, okay?

179
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:57,463
Maybe he's not checking the comments.

180
00:08:57,464 --> 00:08:59,424
Maybe he doesn't even own a computer.
You know, maybe he's like me.

181
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:02,395
Some people still like the feel
of a newspaper in their hands.

182
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,513
What are you, a Luddite?

183
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:06,805
The Luddites were onto something.

184
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:09,472
You know, studies have shown that
people who spend too much time online

185
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:11,534
lose the ability to
identify simple emotions

186
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:14,308
expressed in photographs of human faces.

187
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:16,559
I mean, computers may be the
greatest technological advance

188
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,637
of the last 100 years, but
this whole Internet thing is..

189
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:22,849
Invaluable in making instantaneous
contact at crucial times?

190
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,851
He answered? What did he say?

191
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:27,584
"Hey, kindred spirit. Glad
to know I'm not alone".

192
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:31,215
"You'll get your answer tomorrow
when the next bastard gets his mail".

193
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:34,694
"But if you're as smart as I think you
are, you can be there when it happens".

194
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:37,128
What the hell is that?

195
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:39,011
It's another cipher.

196
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,240
He wants to make sure I'm the
only one that gets the message.

197
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:43,370
Can you decipher it?

198
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:46,371
That's a nasty one.

199
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,589
And it's only, what?

200
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,510
Six hours before the
morning post comes 'round.

201
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:02,295
Not sure if we can crack it in time.

202
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:11,273
No. No. No.

203
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,699
It's not a Vigenère sequence.

204
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,893
And it's not a polyalphabetic
substitution, either.

205
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:17,196
What the hell is that?

206
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:19,797
What difference does it
make if it's not what it is?

207
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:22,832
Traced the I.P. address the
guy used to send the reply from.

208
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:23,998
Came up empty.

209
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,836
Code breakers at the NSA
come up with anything?

210
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:28,080
Nothing yet.

211
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:31,154
Well, then he better hurry up,
because the Chicago postal workers

212
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:32,933
are about to have their morning coffee!

213
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:36,264
Yeah, do you not think I'm
excruciatingly aware of that?

214
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:37,762
I can't.. Don't.. I can't..

215
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:42,983
I can't do this with
everybody hovering around me.

216
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:46,605
What are you doing here?

217
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,527
Thought you could use
a little bit of help.

218
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,891
Yeah, you've been a big help.

219
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:54,592
What fun is there playing a game

220
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:57,599
if the other fellow hasn't
got a sporting chance?

221
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,988
You're talking in riddles.
I have enough of those.

222
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:04,489
I'm simply saying it wouldn't be
cricket for this fellow to write

223
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,930
a code without sending along at
least a hint of how to crack it.

224
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:12,715
You think the killer hid a
key within the code itself.

225
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:15,103
Well, if he had..

226
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:18,584
He'd likely open with it..

227
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:21,283
Wouldn't he?

228
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,040
Look at the numbers, Pierce.

229
00:11:27,806 --> 00:11:31,706
Look very closely at the numbers.

230
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:40,808
What is the relationship
between the groups of figures?

231
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:44,763
14, 41..

232
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,872
No. 144. 12.

233
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:51,046
144 is the square of 12.

234
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,663
225 is the square of 15.

235
00:11:52,664 --> 00:11:54,608
Squares and their roots.

236
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:58,328
Well, that's got to mean something.

237
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:00,937
What? What? Square.. Square roots.

238
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:02,179
Squares.

239
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,578
N.. Not "root" like a potato.

240
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,939
A Route.. Like a highway!

241
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,282
It's a Route cipher.
Squares and their roots..

242
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:11,341
The numbers were the tell.

243
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:12,610
Squares and their roots.

244
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:14,707
But the three stood
apart, meaning you break

245
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,457
each string of letters
into three equal rows.

246
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,685
Then you just.. You just
have to figure out the Route.

247
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:22,929
It could be up and down
columns or in a spiral pattern..

248
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,352
Daniel, this is fantastic, but
can you just tell me what it says?

249
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,891
Here. "You'd better hurry".

250
00:12:27,892 --> 00:12:30,649
"First Monument Bank.

251
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,410
105 Couch Place".

252
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,472
Call First Monument Bank,
have them clear the building

253
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:39,178
and warn their employees
not to open any mail.

254
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:40,576
I'm gonna get an ambulance over there.

255
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:43,948
Tell them to bring Atropine and
Pralidoxime Chloride to treat for Sarin.

256
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:45,321
We're too late.

257
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:48,177
President of First Monument Bank
opened a package 10 minutes ago.

258
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:49,513
He got blasted with Sarin.

259
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:52,158
His name's Russ Anderson.

260
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,879
He's on his way to the E.R.

261
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:02,265
If I'd been 10 minutes faster, he would
not be lying in there on life support.

262
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:04,802
Daniel, this is not your fault.

263
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:06,482
Okay, you didn't poison those men.

264
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:11,475
And we can still catch the guy who
did this before he hits someone else.

265
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:13,580
Have you gotten a hold
of Mr. Anderson's wife?

266
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:16,506
She's on a plane. She'll
be here in an hour.

267
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:19,706
I don't know if he'll last that long.

268
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:20,985
Can we talk to him?

269
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:23,811
He's gone into a coma.

270
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:29,712
That doesn't necessarily mean we
can't try to ask him some questions.

271
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:36,314
Mr. Anderson, my name
is Dr. Daniel Pierce.

272
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,492
I'm so sorry about
what's happened to you.

273
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:41,685
You've been poisoned. The Doctors here
are doing everything they can to help you.

274
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:44,490
Your wife is flying in
from Colorado right now.

275
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,460
In the meantime, we need your help

276
00:13:46,461 --> 00:13:50,078
catching whoever it is
that tried to kill you.

277
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,739
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions.

278
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,745
When you want to answer "yes,"

279
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:57,639
think about throwing a baseball.

280
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,783
And for "no," think about
singing "Happy Birthday".

281
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:05,604
Do you understand?

282
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,330
That's the cerebellum, the region
of the brain responsible for

283
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:14,124
hand-eye coordination. He's
thinking about throwing a baseball.

284
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,733
This is extraordinary.

285
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:17,328
So he's saying "yes".

286
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:20,989
Do you know who attacked you?

287
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,628
That's the medial pre-frontal Cortex.

288
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,801
Where we store our memories of music.

289
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:26,328
He's thinking about
singing "Happy Birthday".

290
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:29,040
So he's saying "no," he
doesn't know who attacked him.

291
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,647
Do you know a lawyer
named Thomas Scantlin?

292
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:33,510
"Yes".

293
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:37,436
Do you know Mr. Scantlin
in a personal capacity?

294
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:38,472
"No".

295
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:41,158
In a professional capacity?

296
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,534
"Yes".

297
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:45,924
Mr. Scantlin was attacked
yesterday the same way you were.

298
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:49,345
Do you have any idea why?

299
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:52,469
"Yes".

300
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,172
Mr. Anderson, I'm gonna ask
you to spell out that reason.

301
00:14:55,173 --> 00:14:58,202
I'll run through the
alphabet letter by letter..

302
00:14:58,203 --> 00:14:59,576
And when I say a letter that's correct,

303
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:01,608
I want you think about
throwing that baseball.

304
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,157
Do you understand?

305
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:06,978
Okay. Here we go.

306
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:08,217
"A"..

307
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:10,079
"D"..

308
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,922
"E"..

309
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:13,358
"E". Got it.

310
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:17,358
"Da-foe". "Dafoe". I mean,
it could be a last name.

311
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:22,999
Is that right, Mr. Anderson?
Is Dafoe somebody that you..

312
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:25,916
Code!

313
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:31,954
Clear!

314
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:41,224
Clear!

315
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:45,081
His heart's stopped.

316
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:47,422
It's over.

317
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:51,306
Time of death, 10:47 P.M.

318
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,010
Mr. Dafoe, thank you for coming in.

319
00:16:00,011 --> 00:16:02,641
Of course. Yeah.

320
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:04,526
I just can't believe
Russ Anderson's dead.

321
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:05,660
He had children.

322
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:07,821
Tom Scantlin, too.

323
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:09,245
You were friends?

324
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:11,814
More business acquaintances, really.

325
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:16,744
A lunch or two a year and share a table
at a charity event, that sort of thing.

326
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:19,714
We asked Mr. Anderson if he had any idea

327
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:23,917
why he and Mr. Scantlin were targeted,
and the only thing he could give us

328
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:26,850
before he died was your name.

329
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:29,011
My name?

330
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:32,117
Wait, you don't think I
had something to do with..

331
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:36,000
No. No. The killer seems to have
a grievance against powerful men.

332
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:37,800
Your being the C.E.O. of a Global

333
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:40,730
agricultural conglomerate
certainly puts you in that club.

334
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:46,272
But the killer's also made it clear that
he has three more victims on his list.

335
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:47,302
Oh, my God.

336
00:16:47,303 --> 00:16:51,267
What we need to do now is determine
what possibly connects the three

337
00:16:51,268 --> 00:16:55,304
of you so we can get a better
idea of who this killer might be.

338
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,159
Well, Chicago's ultimately a small town.

339
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,176
We've done so much business
together over the years.

340
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:01,608
Did any of that business
screw somebody so badly that

341
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:04,259
they'd want to see all
three of you fat cats dead?

342
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,912
I.. I'm sorry, who are you again?

343
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:08,036
Sorry. This is Dr. Daniel Pierce.

344
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:11,190
He's a special consultant
helping the FBI with this case.

345
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:13,991
He gets a little passionate sometimes.

346
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,287
What he's trying to ask is,

347
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:19,987
could any of your dealings
with Mr. Scantlin or Anderson

348
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:24,579
have possibly given
anyone motive for murder?

349
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,449
Well, Scantlin's firm drew up
the I.P.O. that we did last year,

350
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:32,964
and a division of Anderson's
bank handled the offering.

351
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:35,978
And what about that would
have set someone off?

352
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:40,358
We had to lay off 13 executives
and about 250 low-level employees.

353
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,722
Sure, nothing like a little corporate
downsizing to pump up the stock price.

354
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:48,064
Getting your fiscal house in
order is standard before an I.P.O.

355
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:50,628
Can't make an omelet without
breaking a few eggs, right?

356
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:52,504
No, you can't.

357
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:56,535
All right, well, we're gonna need
a list of those 263 employees,

358
00:17:56,536 --> 00:18:00,136
including the low-level ones.

359
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,535
Another needle in another haystack.

360
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:07,083
Meanwhile, the killer
could be at The Post Office,

361
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:09,613
dropping his next delivery
down the mail slot.

362
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:11,440
I'll send him another fan letter.

363
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:12,555
Maybe he'll send me another clue.

364
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:14,431
Maybe this time I'll
figure it out fast enough.

365
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:16,167
All right, I'll log
back onto the thread.

366
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:18,998
Okay. Uh, no code this
time.. Just message.

367
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:21,924
Uh, "now I understand".

368
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:25,373
"You're downsizing the bastards
the same way they downsized you".

369
00:18:25,374 --> 00:18:28,974
"Who's next? Yours, kindred".

370
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:34,983
Okay. It's sent.

371
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:37,936
Now we just got to hope that
he's monitoring the thread.

372
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:40,037
I'm pretty sure he's monitoring.

373
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:40,958
Four..

374
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:41,968
Three..

375
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:43,889
Two..

376
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:57,851
"You're not as smart as I thought you
were. You don't understand me at all".

377
00:18:57,852 --> 00:19:01,752
"I'm finished with you. Goodbye".

378
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,213
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Why aren't you helping Kate?

379
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,263
I.. I couldn't.. I couldn't
think in that place.

380
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:10,731
You know, I.. I had to talk to you.

381
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,600
How can I help?

382
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,917
I thought I'd made a
connection to the killer.

383
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,180
You know, but I.. I must have
guessed wrong about his motive,

384
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:18,232
and now.. Now he's cut me out.

385
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:19,574
Did you try contacting him again?

386
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,043
Not until I have a better guess.

387
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:26,651
But if he's not angry about
being downsized, what is it?

388
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:29,627
You hear those sirens?

389
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:33,828
It sounds like it's right next door.

390
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,734
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

391
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:43,855
I work.. I work here.

392
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,846
Kate?

393
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,184
What the hell is going on?

394
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:49,146
Let me know when you get it.

395
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,386
Okay, Daniel, listen.
It was Sarin again.

396
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,308
It was packed in a canister
like the others with a

397
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,380
charge to release the gas
when the package was opened.

398
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:56,912
- Who opened it?
- Nobody.

399
00:19:56,913 --> 00:20:00,137
Looks like it was dropped
and went off accidentally.

400
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:01,532
The victim was Kelly Owens.

401
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,551
She was working part-time
in the faculty mail room.

402
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:04,886
Oh, that poor girl.

403
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:06,187
And her parents.

404
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:09,156
Well, obviously she wasn't the target.
Who was the package addressed to?

405
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:12,480
Mailing label was incinerated
in the explosion. We don't know.

406
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:14,639
Actually, I'm pretty sure we do.

407
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,503
Our mad scientist here made the paper.

408
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:19,166
What?

409
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:22,678
"Anonymous sources report
that Dr. Daniel Pierce of CLMU"

410
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,207
"has been helping the FBI decipher
the killer's coded messages".

411
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,327
He found out his kindred
spirit's talking to the cops.

412
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,204
"Anonymous sources". What, have
you been blabbing to the press?

413
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:34,215
Me? There's dozens of
agents working on this case.

414
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:36,156
And if you think that I
would jeopardize my career

415
00:20:36,157 --> 00:20:38,000
to get your name in the paper,
you're crazier than I thought.

416
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:40,011
Listen, there will be an
investigation into the leak.

417
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:42,038
What matters now is
that you're in danger.

418
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,854
No, no, I don't buy it. I don't buy it.

419
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:46,397
This guy's a methodical
killer with an urgent agenda.

420
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:48,115
He's not gonna waste
time on some detour just

421
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:49,873
because he finds out
I'm not his best friend.

422
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,424
We need to err on the side of caution.

423
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:54,043
I'm taking you home and
having you guarded, all right?

424
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:54,938
- What?
- Come on.

425
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:59,534
No, no, I don't want some
stranger lurking around my house.

426
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:05,355
Okay, fine. It'll have to be
someone who you already know.

427
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:15,392
You got cable?

428
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:24,531
That package wasn't meant for me.

429
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:27,246
Daniel, maybe you don't want
to accept it because then you'd

430
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:30,024
have to take responsibility for
what happened to that poor girl.

431
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:32,725
No, that's not what I'm
saying. I.. I responsible.

432
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:35,970
I mean, if I'd caught the
killer already, that girl..

433
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:37,761
Sorry to interrupt.

434
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,767
Do you mind?

435
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:41,934
Oh, I thought you were
talking to someone.

436
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:43,830
What do you want?

437
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:45,366
Mustard.

438
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,109
What?

439
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,675
You know, Grey Poupon, yellow?

440
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,589
I'm making a sandwich.

441
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,690
Lewicki!

442
00:21:55,175 --> 00:21:57,035
Yes.

443
00:21:57,446 --> 00:22:00,389
Would you get the good
Agent some mustard?

444
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,645
Uh, I'm on strike, remember?

445
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:05,025
Lewicki, I don't have time for this.

446
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:07,314
Then I suggest you say "please".

447
00:22:07,315 --> 00:22:10,958
And I suggest you get the damn mustard.

448
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,035
Fine.

449
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:15,946
But not because you ordered me
to.. Because I'm a nice person.

450
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:18,414
Right this way.

451
00:22:18,415 --> 00:22:22,093
If the package wasn't
for you, who was it for?

452
00:22:22,094 --> 00:22:23,908
I don't now.

453
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:28,156
Someone on campus who is somehow
connected to Anderson, Scantlin, and Dafoe.

454
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:30,258
Well, let's take them one at a time.

455
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:31,726
What field is Dafoe in?

456
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:34,487
He's a C.E.O..

457
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,758
Where the hell is my faculty directory?

458
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,059
In here, under the gong.

459
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:44,011
Under the gong.

460
00:22:45,173 --> 00:22:48,293
College of agriculture.

461
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:53,401
Arthur Wei..

462
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:57,631
Holds the distinguished Frederick
James Dafoe professorship

463
00:22:57,632 --> 00:22:59,388
of genetic engineering.

464
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:01,489
Probert!

465
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:06,955
Can I help you?

466
00:23:06,956 --> 00:23:09,111
I'm Dr. Daniel Pierce,
Department of Neuroscience.

467
00:23:09,112 --> 00:23:10,861
This is Agent Probert of the FBI.

468
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:12,322
FBI? What's this about?

469
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:14,746
This conversation is private.

470
00:23:14,747 --> 00:23:18,118
I assume you heard about Kelly Owens,
the girl who died on campus today?

471
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,316
Yeah, it's terrible.

472
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:20,872
It should have been you.

473
00:23:20,873 --> 00:23:23,149
- Excuse me?
- You were the target.

474
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,855
What's your connection
to Frederick Dafoe,

475
00:23:24,856 --> 00:23:28,407
apart from the fact that you hold a chair
generously endowed by his foundation?

476
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,552
What the hell is this?

477
00:23:29,553 --> 00:23:32,944
Look, either you talk to me,
or I get that guy out there

478
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,652
to phone his buddies
at the Bureau, and then

479
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:36,720
it's the handcuffs, the
all-night interrogation,

480
00:23:36,721 --> 00:23:39,310
sweating in a damp cell until you
finally break and spill it anyway.

481
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:41,771
All in all, I'd say your
best bet is talking to me.

482
00:23:41,772 --> 00:23:47,672
Now, what did you do for Frederick
Dafoe that got you the endowed chair?

483
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,980
I'm an agricultural geneticist.

484
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:54,391
I created a new strain
of corn for his company.

485
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:59,132
Why would someone try
to kill you for that?

486
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:06,544
Look, while I was working on the gene..

487
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,348
I realized there was a possibility..

488
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:11,873
Of a troubling collateral effect.

489
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:14,024
What "collateral effect"?

490
00:24:14,025 --> 00:24:17,083
My strain of corn was
genetically dominant.

491
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:19,795
If the seed blew into
the neighboring farm.

492
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:25,190
It would wipe out the native corn and
take over the other farmer's field.

493
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:27,421
I was trying to re-engineer the seed

494
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:31,020
so it could achieve harmony
with the other strains.

495
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:33,710
But Dafoe ordered me not to.

496
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:34,811
Why?

497
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:36,520
At the time, I didn't know it,

498
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:39,197
but once the gene spread
to the neighboring farms,

499
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:42,425
Dafoe started suing the
farmers for selling his corn..

500
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:44,454
My corn.. To the consumer.

501
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:45,939
On what grounds?

502
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,241
Copyright infringement.

503
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:50,761
He held the patent on the gene.

504
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:53,376
He sued them for selling a strain
of corn that blew in on the wind?

505
00:24:53,377 --> 00:24:54,490
Are you kidding me?

506
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:58,197
Look, they didn't realize
they were growing it.

507
00:24:58,198 --> 00:24:59,551
A lot of them went into foreclosure.

508
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:01,377
Oh. Of course. Let me guess..

509
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:03,667
Dafoe started buying up
their farms on the cheap.

510
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,025
I went to Dafoe. I told him
if he doesn't drop the suits,

511
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:09,096
I would inform the
Department of Agriculture

512
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:10,179
that he'd planned the whole thing.

513
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,412
Right, and then he offered
you the endowed chair

514
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:14,883
and maybe a little
grant money as a kicker.

515
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:17,028
Look you're a scientist.

516
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:18,735
You know how hard it is to get funding..

517
00:25:18,736 --> 00:25:20,447
Spare me that crap.

518
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:23,812
You took your 30 pieces of silver,
and those farmers lost everything.

519
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,899
No, you don't understand.

520
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,579
No, I think I understand just fine..

521
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,800
Professor.

522
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:35,829
Kevin Lang, Cal Bowden, Ray Donaldson..

523
00:25:36,725 --> 00:25:39,248
Any of these names mean
anything to you, Mr. Dafoe?

524
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:40,630
Uh, no, I've never heard of them.

525
00:25:40,631 --> 00:25:43,622
Of course not. You got lawyers for that.

526
00:25:43,623 --> 00:25:46,104
Lang, Bowden, and Donaldson
were three of the farmers

527
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:48,648
whose lives you ruined
when you sued them

528
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:52,497
for copyright infringement
for unknowingly taking corn

529
00:25:52,498 --> 00:25:55,358
containing the Dafoe gene to market.

530
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:57,426
That gene was patented.

531
00:25:57,427 --> 00:26:00,130
Yeah, and designed to obliterate
every cornstalk in its path.

532
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:01,668
Scantlin handled the lawsuits,

533
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:04,219
and then Anderson fast-tracked
the farms to foreclosure,

534
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,453
so you could snap up those
properties for pennies on the dollar.

535
00:26:07,454 --> 00:26:09,855
Yes, that's called good business.

536
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:12,860
U.S. Attorney's gonna call
it conspiracy to commit fraud.

537
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:14,452
All right, listen, Sweetie,

538
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,938
I'm not gonna say another word
to you without a lawyer present.

539
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:19,156
That's fine.

540
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:21,011
But in the meantime..

541
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,340
The killer is still out there.

542
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:24,814
It's a pretty good bet
that you are on his list.

543
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:30,715
So I suggest you tell us which of the
farmers you ruined might be doing this.

544
00:26:31,395 --> 00:26:36,503
Okay, there was an incident
at the shareholders meeting.

545
00:26:36,504 --> 00:26:38,589
A very angry man stormed into the room,

546
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,030
yelling threats and obscenities,
and he had to be escorted out.

547
00:26:42,031 --> 00:26:42,867
I need a name.

548
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:46,241
I don't know. Maybe my security
people might have it. Look..

549
00:26:46,242 --> 00:26:49,504
Are you going to be
able to keep me safe?

550
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:52,153
Oh, yeah. U.S. Marshals
will protect you.

551
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:54,815
After all, we wouldn't want
anything happening to you

552
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:59,436
before you can start
serving your sentence.

553
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:06,996
Got the name of the farmer that stormed the
shareholder meeting and threatened Dafoe..

554
00:27:06,997 --> 00:27:08,843
Paul Levasseur.

555
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:10,432
Great. Let's go pick him up.

556
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:13,421
He's serving 8 to 10
in Stateville Prison.

557
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:16,662
Been there three months.

558
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:18,914
Not our guy.

559
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:21,919
But maybe he can tell us who is.

560
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,612
How do you figure that?

561
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:27,416
Why did the killer put
his message in a newspaper?

562
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,158
Maybe because he was
sending it to somebody whose

563
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,187
letters get opened and read
before they're delivered.

564
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:35,008
Someone in prison.

565
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:41,010
My great-great-grandfather
homesteaded that land.

566
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:43,351
My family..

567
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:46,010
Farmed it for 100 years.

568
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:49,018
After the lawsuit, I tried
other things to get by.

569
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:51,539
Sold tractors.

570
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:55,419
Dug ditches for the County.

571
00:27:55,901 --> 00:27:57,296
Nothing stuck.

572
00:27:57,297 --> 00:27:59,058
So you robbed a bank.

573
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:01,891
Just trying to keep
my family above water.

574
00:28:01,892 --> 00:28:05,546
Losing the farm, seeing me behind bars..

575
00:28:05,547 --> 00:28:08,316
Broke my wife's heart.

576
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:12,157
She hung herself nine weeks ago.

577
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:14,752
I'm so sorry.

578
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:21,265
Listen, Mr. Levasseur, we're here
to talk to you about your son, Eddie.

579
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,728
The coded message in the newspaper..

580
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:27,049
He put that there for you, didn't he?

581
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:29,554
"Front-page news".

582
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:32,088
Just like he said.

583
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:36,631
I tried to call him after
I read about Scantlin.

584
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,086
But his phone was turned off.

585
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:40,144
You could have called the police.

586
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:43,685
I know I should have, but..

587
00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:50,143
He was your boy. You
couldn't bear to turn him in.

588
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:51,431
After..

589
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:55,360
After this all went down,
something in him broke.

590
00:28:55,361 --> 00:28:59,589
But I swear to you, he's a good boy.

591
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,650
A brilliant boy.

592
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:03,200
Finished college in three years.

593
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,976
Couldn't wait to get
started in on his PHD.

594
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,091
But he had to drop out
after you lost the farm.

595
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:10,070
I couldn't send him a dime.

596
00:29:10,071 --> 00:29:14,410
He's been teaching
high-school math in Harvey.

597
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:16,878
Actually, he hasn't been
there in over a month.

598
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:19,166
He hasn't been back to
his apartment, either.

599
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,952
We need to find him
before someone else dies.

600
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:26,973
Do you have any idea where he is?

601
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:32,515
There's a.. There's a place
he used to like to go to think.

602
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:36,716
On the back acreage of our old farm.

603
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:49,181
Look at this. He knew we were coming.

604
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,371
"Hey, kindred, my life's an open book".

605
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:54,846
"When you crack this one,
you'll know everything".

606
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:55,972
"But search your mind".

607
00:29:55,973 --> 00:29:58,000
"Do you really want to stop me?"

608
00:29:58,001 --> 00:29:59,004
What is it with this guy?

609
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,277
First he blows you off, then
he leaves you another clue?

610
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,614
He wants to avenge the injustice done
to his Father and the other farmers,

611
00:30:04,615 --> 00:30:06,631
but he did not mean to kill
an innocent college student,

612
00:30:06,632 --> 00:30:09,620
so maybe he's feeling
guilty or conflicted.

613
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:11,254
Some part of him wants to get caught.

614
00:30:11,255 --> 00:30:12,660
Let's give him what he wants.

615
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:15,860
"My life's an open book".

616
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:17,293
"Open book". It's a book cipher.

617
00:30:17,294 --> 00:30:19,455
Look, the numbers are
in groups of three.

618
00:30:19,456 --> 00:30:22,198
The first one corresponds to a
page number in a particular book,

619
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:25,509
the second one.. Second number
to.. To a line on that page,

620
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,456
and the third number
to a word in that line.

621
00:30:27,457 --> 00:30:29,461
You find the words, you put them
together, you get your message.

622
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:32,128
- What book?
- It could..

623
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:36,184
It could be any book in the world.

624
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:39,905
You're not listening, old boy.

625
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:42,619
He's telling you
everything you need to know.

626
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,611
What do you mean? What
are you talking about?

627
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:48,792
I didn't say anything.

628
00:30:49,783 --> 00:30:53,203
"Search your mind," Pierce.

629
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,544
I am. I am.

630
00:30:56,545 --> 00:30:57,567
It's not helping!

631
00:30:57,568 --> 00:30:59,805
Daniel, you all right?

632
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:01,485
Yeah. Don't.. Don't worry about me.

633
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:06,047
Okay? I'm f.. Fine.
Just don't worry about..

634
00:31:06,048 --> 00:31:07,848
Me.

635
00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:11,314
You need to take me home.

636
00:31:11,315 --> 00:31:12,327
This is our key.

637
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,401
"The Mind: Knowing The Unknowable".

638
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:16,214
By Dr. Daniel Pierce. I love this book.

639
00:31:16,215 --> 00:31:19,118
- But what do you..
- He's not saying "search your mind".

640
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,838
He's saying "search your mind".

641
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:24,776
- He means the title of your book.
- Yeah.

642
00:31:24,777 --> 00:31:26,909
Go to page..

643
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,770
312.

644
00:31:29,353 --> 00:31:32,593
Second line, third word.

645
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:35,138
"Today".

646
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,807
Page 57.

647
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:41,868
17th line, 12th word.

648
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:55,825
14th line, 9th word.

649
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,986
"Family".

650
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:04,366
"Today I destroy the villain the same
way the villain destroyed my family".

651
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:07,148
"Destroy the villain".
Who's he talking about?

652
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:09,148
It's got to be Dafoe. I mean, he's..

653
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:10,806
He's the main villain in
this whole sordid story.

654
00:32:10,807 --> 00:32:12,208
Dafoe is in protective custody.

655
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:14,677
How's the killer gonna
destroy him there?

656
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:18,427
There are a million ways to destroy
someone whose only priority is profits.

657
00:32:18,428 --> 00:32:21,050
I mean, you could take out
their processing plants,

658
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:24,192
or their warehouses or
their grain elevators.

659
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,633
Yeah, it's a huge company.

660
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:28,120
We don't have the manpower to
protect every one of his facilities.

661
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:33,221
But we can try. Just get
the boss on the phone.

662
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:37,103
A word with you, old chap?

663
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:42,499
What do you want?

664
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,700
"Today I destroy the villain the same
way the villain destroyed my family".

665
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,432
Yeah. So?

666
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:52,150
Perhaps there's another code
buried in the message itself.

667
00:32:52,151 --> 00:32:56,549
Daniel, you don't have to listen to him.

668
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,377
Each letter represents a number.

669
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:00,309
You don't need his help.

670
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,259
Perhaps it's an address.

671
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,943
You've cracked the ciphers.

672
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:05,645
Now it's about cracking Eddie.

673
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:08,100
What do you mean?

674
00:33:08,101 --> 00:33:10,768
What did Dafoe do that really hurt him?

675
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:14,367
Did he take away his
farm, his livelihood..

676
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:18,388
Or something more important to him?

677
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:27,124
I love you, Natalie Vincent.

678
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:29,235
I did it. I.. I solved the riddle.

679
00:33:29,236 --> 00:33:30,986
- I know what Eddie's doing.
- So do we.

680
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:33,147
Our agents found a truck
bomb full of fertilizer

681
00:33:33,148 --> 00:33:34,795
just outside Dafoe headquarters.

682
00:33:34,796 --> 00:33:37,795
What? No. No, no, no. That's a decoy.

683
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:40,536
Remember the original message..
"One down, four to go".

684
00:33:40,537 --> 00:33:41,779
That makes five victims.

685
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,760
Now Eddie's telling us..

686
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:47,154
"Today I destroy the villain the same
way the villain destroyed my family".

687
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:50,781
H.. His Father's in prison, his Mother
took her own life, all because of Dafoe.

688
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:54,058
Three of the victims are
dead. Who are the last two?

689
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,759
Dafoe's parents.

690
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,373
He's in there with the Dafoes.

691
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,472
Question is, what's he waiting for?

692
00:34:05,473 --> 00:34:08,942
He's waiting to talk to me.

693
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:11,021
Want to give this a try?

694
00:34:11,022 --> 00:34:12,482
No, it's got to
be face-to-face.

695
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,878
Daniel, you're not going in there.

696
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,381
He told me how to find him.

697
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:18,645
He must have something to say to me.

698
00:34:18,646 --> 00:34:21,156
All right, well, I'm going in with you.

699
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:23,822
And you're wearing a wire so
SWAT can hear what's going on.

700
00:34:23,823 --> 00:34:26,092
Look, if you can get
him in front of a window,

701
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:30,233
one of my snipers can take him out.

702
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,682
Uh, Eddie..

703
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:45,787
I'm Dr. Daniel Pierce.

704
00:34:45,788 --> 00:34:48,428
May I come in?

705
00:34:50,618 --> 00:34:52,089
Just him.

706
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,450
And if you or anyone else
so much as rattles this

707
00:34:54,451 --> 00:34:56,411
doorknob, I press this button,
and we all go up together.

708
00:34:56,412 --> 00:34:59,232
Do you understand?

709
00:34:59,466 --> 00:35:03,126
- Daniel.
- I.. I can do it.

710
00:35:21,048 --> 00:35:23,784
There's a way out of this, Eddie.

711
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:26,714
There's no other way out for me.

712
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:28,808
If you believe that..

713
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:31,224
Then why did you tell
me where to find you?

714
00:35:31,225 --> 00:35:33,896
I mean, the puzzles were clever but..

715
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:35,141
You knew I'd be able to solve them.

716
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:37,013
Yeah. I wanted you here..

717
00:35:37,014 --> 00:35:40,339
Because you said you were my kindred
spirit, and I wanted to believe

718
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,376
that there was someone out
there who understood me.

719
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:48,021
But you've been working
for the cops the whole time.

720
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:50,127
You're gonna have to die with me.

721
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:51,549
Get him out of there right now!

722
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,623
No, if we storm in there,
he pushes the button.

723
00:35:53,624 --> 00:35:57,164
Your guy's all on his own.

724
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:02,927
You know, I knew I was taking a risk
when I came through that door but uh..

725
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:06,168
- I came anyway.
- Why?

726
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:07,584
Because I am your kindred spirit.

727
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:09,236
- Bullshit.
- No, it's true.

728
00:36:09,237 --> 00:36:10,551
Yeah, I'm working for the cops,

729
00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:14,027
but I believe in what
you're fighting for, Eddie.

730
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:17,541
I hate lawyers, Eddie, and
.. And.. And corporations

731
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:21,479
and the way they screw over
hardworking, honest people.

732
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,557
What Scantlin and Anderson and the rest
of those bastards did to your family..

733
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:27,052
Is unforgivable. It's.. It's evil.

734
00:36:27,053 --> 00:36:32,094
I understand why you'd
want to make them pay. I do.

735
00:36:32,095 --> 00:36:36,041
- But these people didn't do anything.
- Yes, they did.

736
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:38,184
They raised a monster.

737
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:41,594
They raised a son that
has no conscience at all.

738
00:36:41,595 --> 00:36:45,482
And your Father raised you,
and you do have a conscience.

739
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:47,850
And that's the real reason that
you brought me here, isn't it?

740
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:49,810
Because deep down, you
want me to stop you from

741
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:51,476
- killing anyone else.
- You're wrong.

742
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:55,815
You started this, Eddie, because you
wanted to make your Father proud of you.

743
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:58,116
He still can be.

744
00:36:58,117 --> 00:37:01,651
Nobody else has to die. You've
already finished the job.

745
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,831
What are you talking about?

746
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:06,732
Dafoe and Wei are going to jail.

747
00:37:07,277 --> 00:37:08,256
You're lying.

748
00:37:08,257 --> 00:37:09,374
No, I'm not.

749
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,237
Thanks to you, I figured
out what they were doing

750
00:37:11,238 --> 00:37:13,226
to your Father and the other farmers.

751
00:37:13,227 --> 00:37:16,365
The U.S. Attorney is gonna indict
them. There'll be lawsuits, Eddie.

752
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:17,963
Some of those farmers
will get their land back.

753
00:37:17,964 --> 00:37:20,254
It's too late for my Father and me.

754
00:37:20,255 --> 00:37:22,340
Well, maybe you could still be together.

755
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,201
How?

756
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,848
In hell?

757
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:29,717
I'll talk to the U.S. Attorney about
having you sentenced to Stateville.

758
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:31,998
I promise.

759
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:35,395
Now..

760
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:38,739
Why don't you put down
that detonator and..

761
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,048
Let's walk out of here together.

762
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:47,949
If I go out there, the only cell they're
gonna put me in is one on Death Row.

763
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:53,881
And I deserve to die.

764
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:56,984
I killed an innocent girl.

765
00:37:56,985 --> 00:38:00,545
Yeah, and you can pay for that
crime, Eddie, but not with your life.

766
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:02,147
There were mitigating circumstances.

767
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:05,303
You were traumatized by what Dafoe
and his cabal did to your family,

768
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:07,035
and I'll testify to that.

769
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:10,216
You lied to me before.

770
00:38:10,223 --> 00:38:12,316
How do I know you're
not lying to me now?

771
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:15,251
I got the shot, Sir. Take it.

772
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:17,930
Eddie, get away from that window!

773
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:19,791
God!

774
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:30,827
Why the hell did you do that, huh?

775
00:38:30,828 --> 00:38:33,362
Why didn't you just let them kill me?

776
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:36,459
Because I meant what I said, Eddie.

777
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,700
Nobody else has to die.

778
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:50,610
I could still push this button.

779
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:53,191
Yeah, you can.

780
00:38:56,302 --> 00:39:00,442
But I don't think you're going to.

781
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:20,231
Come on. Come on. Come on.
What the hell is going on?

782
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:28,710
Hold your fire!

783
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:30,358
He's surrendering!

784
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,037
He left the detonator inside!

785
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,738
Go! Go! Go! Go!

786
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:44,051
You did the right thing, Eddie.

787
00:39:48,297 --> 00:39:50,234
Daniel!

788
00:39:50,235 --> 00:39:51,991
- Are you okay?
- Yep.

789
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:53,411
You sure?

790
00:39:53,412 --> 00:39:57,647
Yeah. That.. That could have
gone a whole different way.

791
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:00,032
I knew you were crazy. I
didn't know you were that crazy.

792
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:02,793
Yeah. Me neither.

793
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:08,850
What is a conscience?

794
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:14,527
Is it something we can locate on an MRI?

795
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:19,936
Studies have shown that people with damage
to the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex

796
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:23,891
are actually more willing
to sacrifice a human life

797
00:40:23,892 --> 00:40:29,279
as long as they perceive that
it's for some greater good.

798
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,201
But what about people
who have no trouble

799
00:40:31,202 --> 00:40:34,662
sacrificing others to
their own selfish ends?

800
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:37,484
Is heartless cruelty our true nature?

801
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:40,218
And empathy the aberration?

802
00:40:40,219 --> 00:40:44,384
My Grandmother used to
say, "it's nice to be nice".

803
00:40:44,385 --> 00:40:45,508
And that may be true.

804
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:51,409
Or are we better off spending every waking
moment tending our own selfish needs?

805
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:54,506
The good news is, it turns out
there's an evolutionary advantage

806
00:40:54,507 --> 00:40:56,800
to simple human kindness.

807
00:40:56,801 --> 00:41:01,605
We couldn't get through a cold paleolithic
winter without a little cooperation.

808
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:06,485
Still, on some prehistoric
level we're all lone hunters.

809
00:41:06,486 --> 00:41:12,386
So it can feel dangerous to show any
softness to other members of the tribe.

810
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:21,254
But if we manage to lay down our
clubs and our sharpened rocks,

811
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:25,476
answering the call of the
altruistic imperative..

812
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:28,657
Can be its own reward.
