00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.640
How's your blog going?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.000
Yeah, good, very good.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.680
You haven't written a word, have you?

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.520
You just wrote
"still has trust issues".

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.560
And you read my writing upside down.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.200
You see what I mean?

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.120
John, you're a soldier

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.760
and it's going to take you
a while to adjust to civilian life

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.600
and writing a blog
about everything that happens to you
will honestly help you.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.080
Nothing happens to me.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.080
'What do you mean there's no ruddy
car?' He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.760
Get a cab! I never get cabs!

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.600
I love you. When?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.800
Get a cab!

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.400
My husband

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.600
was a happy man
who lived life to the full.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.920
He loved his family and his work,

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.440
and that he should have
taken his own life in this way

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.480
is a mystery

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.800
and a shock to all who knew him.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.600
Taxi, taxi!

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.560
I'll be just two minutes, mate.
What?

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.600
I'm just going home to get
my umbrella. You can share mine.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.040
Two minutes, all right?

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.840
She still dancing?

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.640
Yeah, if you can call it that.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.720
Did you get the car keys off her?
Got them out of her bag.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.360
Where is she?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.680
The body of Beth Davenport,
Junior Minister for Transport,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.320
was found late last night
on a building site in Greater London.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.960
Preliminary investigations
suggest that this was suicide.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.920
We can confirm that this apparent
suicide closely resembles those of

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.680
Sir Jeffrey Patterson
and James Phillimore.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.320
In the light of this, these incidents
are now being treated as linked.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.320
The investigation is ongoing
but Detective Inspector Lestrade
will take questions now.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.680
Detective Inspector,
how can suicides be linked?

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.800
Well, they all took the same poison.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.000
They were all found in places
they had no reason to be.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.160
None of them had shown any prior
indication. But you can't have
serial suicides.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.840
Well, apparently you can.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.880
These three people,
there's nothing that links them?

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.400
There's no link we've found yet but

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.640
we're looking for it.
There has to be one.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.960
If you've all got texts, please
ignore them. It just says "Wrong".

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.360
Well, just ignore that.
If there are no more questions,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.000
I'm going to bring
this session to an end.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.680
If they're suicides,
what are you investigating?

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.000
As I say, these suicides
are clearly linked.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.680
It's an unusual situation, we've
got our best people investigating.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.560
Says "Wrong" again.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.760
One more question. Is there any
chance that these are murders?

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.520
And if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.360
I know that you like
writing about these but these
do appear to be suicides.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.400
We know the difference. The poison
was clearly self-administered.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.440
Yes, but if they are murders,
how do people keep themselves safe?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.000
Well, don't commit suicide.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.360
Daily Mail!

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:50.240
This is a frightening time
for people but all anyone has to do
is exercise reasonable precautions.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.120
We are all as safe as we want to be.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.480
MOBILE PHONES BUZZ

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.080
Thank you.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.200
You've got to stop him doing that.
He's making us look like idiots.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.760
If you can tell me
how he does it, I'll stop him.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.840
John!

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.480
John Watson!

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.240
Stamford, Mike Stamford.
We were at Barts together.
Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.720
Yes, I know, I got fat. No, no.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.520
I heard you were abroad somewhere
getting shot at. What happened?

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.000
I got shot.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.000
Are you still at Barts then?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.280
Teaching now, yeah, bright
young things like we used to be.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.360
God, I hate them.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.080
What about you, just staying in
town till you get yourself sorted?

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.840
I can't afford London
on an Army pension.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.560
Couldn't bear to be anywhere else.
That's not the John Watson I know.
I'm not the John Watson.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.960
Couldn't Harry help?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.040
Yeah, like that's going to happen(!)

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.080
I don't know,
get a flatshare or something?

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.760
Who'd want me for a flatmate?

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.880
What?

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.320
You're the second person
to say that to me today.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.680
Who was the first?

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.240
How fresh?

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.120
Just in. 67, natural causes.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.280
Used to work here.
I knew him, he was nice.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.520
Fine.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.680
We'll start with the riding crop.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.480
So, bad day was it?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.600
I need to know what bruises
form in the next 20 minutes.
A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.920
Listen, I was wondering.
Maybe later, when you're finished...

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.000
You're wearing lipstick.
You weren't wearing lipstick before.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.960
I refreshed it a bit.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.480
Sorry, you were saying?

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.280
I was wondering
if you'd like to have coffee?

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.000
Black, two sugars, please.
I'll be upstairs.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.560
OK.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.720
KNOCK ON DOOR

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.680
Bit different from my day.
You've no idea!

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.880
Mike, can I borrow your phone?
There's no signal on mine.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.760
And what's wrong with the landline?
I prefer to text.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.920
Sorry, it's in my coat.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.680
Here, use mine.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.200
Oh, thank you.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.320
This is an old friend of mine,
John Watson.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.720
Afghanistan or Iraq?

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.920
Sorry?
Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.240
Afghanistan, sorry,
how did you know?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.360
Ah! Coffee, thank you.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.920
What happened to the lipstick?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.760
It wasn't working for me.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.960
Really? It was a big improvement.
Your mouth's too small now.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.520
OK.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.160
How do you feel about the violin?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.920
I'm sorry, what?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.880
I play the violin when I'm thinking
and sometimes I don't talk for days
on end. Would that bother you?

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.080
Potential flatmates should know
the worst about each other.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.880
You told him about me? Not a word.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.760
Who said anything about flatmates?

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.080
I did. Told Mike this morning
that I must be a difficult man
to find a flatmate for.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.320
Now here he is just after lunch with
an old friend clearly just home from

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.160
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn't a difficult leap.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.600
How did you know about Afghanistan?

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.840
Got my eye on a nice little place
in central London.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.520
We ought to be able to afford it.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.600
We'll meet there tomorrow
evening, seven o'clock.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.520
Sorry, got to dash. I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.080
Is that it?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.040
Is that what?

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.760
We've only just met and we're
going to go and look at a flat?

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.520
Problem?

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.600
We don't know
a thing about each other.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.120
I don't know where we're meeting,
I don't even know your name.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.160
I know you're an Army doctor
and you've been invalided home
from Afghanistan.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.280
You've got a brother worried
about you but you won't go
to him for help because you don't

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.920
approve of him, possibly because he's
an alcoholic, more likely because
he recently walked out on his wife.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.480
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp's psychosomatic,
quite correctly, I'm afraid.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.960
That's enough to be going
on with, don't you think?

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.160
The name's Sherlock Holmes
and the address is 221B Baker Street.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.680
Afternoon.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.360
Yeah, he's always like that.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.600
Hello.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.640
Ah - Mr Holmes. Sherlock, please.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.000
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Mrs Hudson, the landlady -
she's given me a special deal.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.760
Owes me a favour. A few years back,
her husband got himself
sentenced to death in Florida.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.680
I was able to help out. Sorry - you
stopped her husband being executed?

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.240
Oh, no, I ensured it.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.880
Sherlock!

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.440
Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.440
Hello. Come in. Thank you.
Shall we...?

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.120
Well, this could be very nice.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.480
Very nice indeed.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.840
Yes.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.360
Yes, I think so,
my thoughts precisely.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:10.240
TOGETHER: So I went straight ahead
and moved in. Soon as we get all this
rubbish cleaned out...

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.440
So this is all... Well, obviously I
can erm...straighten things up a bit.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.520
That's a skull. Friend of mine.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.160
When I say friend...

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.240
What do you think, then, Dr Watson?

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.240
There's another bedroom upstairs,
if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.240
Of course we'll be needing two.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:35.080
Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts
round here. Mrs Turner next door's
got (married ones).

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.920
Oh...
Sherlock! The mess you've made.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.120
I looked you up on
the internet last night.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.600
Anything interesting? Found your
website. The Science of Deduction.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.920
What did you think?

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.840
You said you could identify
a software designer by his tie and
an airline pilot by his left thumb?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.120
Yes.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.760
And I can read your military career
in your face and your leg,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.840
and your brother's drinking habits
on your mobile phone.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.960
How?

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.040
What about these suicides then,
Sherlock? I thought that'd be
right up your street.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.560
Three exactly the same.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.800
Four.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.360
There's been a fourth.
And there's something different
this time. A fourth?

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.040
Where? Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.880
What's new about this one? You
wouldn't have come to me otherwise.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.560
You know how they never leave notes?
Yeah. This one did.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.520
Will you come?

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.400
Who's on forensics? Anderson.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.080
He doesn't work well with me.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.720
Well, he won't be your assistant.
I NEED an assistant.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.320
Will you come? Not in a police car,
I'll be right behind.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.120
Thank you.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.720
Brilliant! Yes!

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.000
Four serial suicides, and now a note.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.160
Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs Hudson,
I'll be late. Might need some food.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.920
I'm your landlady, dear,
not your housekeeper.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.520
Something cold will do. John, have
a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.280
Don't wait up!

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.800
Look at him, dashing about...

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:27.840
My husband was just the same.
But you're more
the sitting-down type, I can tell.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.000
I'll make you that cuppa,
you rest your leg.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.600
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry -

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.520
It's just sometimes
this bloody thing...

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.360
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.360
Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you.
Just this once, dear,
I'm not your housekeeper.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.120
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got 'em. Not your housekeeper!

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.280
You're a doctor.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.000
In fact you're an Army doctor.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.360
Yes.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.840
Any good?

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.880
Very good.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.680
Seen a lot of injuries, then.
Violent deaths.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.720
Well, yes.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.320
Bit of trouble too, I bet?

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:12.600
Of course. Yes.
Enough for a lifetime, far too much.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.600
Want to see some more? Oh, God, yes.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.440
Sorry Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea.
Off out. Both of you?

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.760
Impossible suicides? Four of them?

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.920
No point sitting at home when there's
finally something fun going on!

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.320
Look at you, all happy. It's not
decent. Who cares about decent?

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.720
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.840
Taxi!

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.120
OK, You've got questions...

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.160
Yeah, where are we going?

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.600
Crime scene. Next?

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.760
Who are you, what do you do?
What do you think?

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.360
I'd say...private detective. But?

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.280
But the police don't go
to private detectives.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.000
I'm a consulting detective. Only
one in the world, I invented the job.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.240
What does that mean? Means when
the police are out of their depth,
which is always,

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.200
they consult me.
The police don't consult amateurs.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.120
When I met you for the first time
yesterday, I said Afghanistan
or Iraq. You looked surprised.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.200
Yes, how DID you know?
I didn't know, I saw.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.120
'Your haircut, the way
you hold yourself says military.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.600
'But your conversation...'
Bit different from my day.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.520
..said trained at Barts -
so Army doctor, obvious.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.280
'Your face is tanned...

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.680
'but no tan above the wrists. You've
been abroad, but not sunbathing.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.760
'Your limp's really bad
when you walk, but you don't ask
for a chair when you stand -

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.760
'so it's at least partly
psychosomatic.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.920
'That says the original circumstances
of the injury were traumatic -'

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.840
wounded in action then. Wounded in
action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.560
You said I had a therapist.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.680
You've got a psychosomatic limp,
of course you've got a therapist.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.560
Then there's your brother. Mm?
Your phone.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.600
'It's expensive,
e-mail enabled, MP3 player.'

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.840
And you're looking for a flatshare.
You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.080
'Scratches.
Not one, many over time -'

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.040
it's been in the same pocket
as keys and coins.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.240
You wouldn't treat
your one luxury item like this,

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.360
so it's had a previous owner.
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.920
The engraving?

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.960
Harry Watson. Clearly a family
member who's given you his old phone.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.200
Not your father,
this is a young man's gadget.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.240
Could be a cousin, but you're a war
hero who can't find a place to live -

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.200
unlikely you've got an extended
family, not one you're close to.
So brother it is.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.120
Now, who's Clara? Three kisses
says it's a romantic attachment.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.520
The expense of the phone
says wife, not girlfriend.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.080
Must have given it to him recently,
it's only six months old.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.760
Marriage in trouble then -
six months on he's given it away.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.040
If she'd left HIM,
he would have kept it. Sentiment.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.920
No, he wanted rid of it. He left HER.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.360
He gave the phone to you,
so he wants you to stay in touch.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.520
You're looking for cheap
accommodation, but you're not
going to your brother for help -

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.120
that says you've got problems
with him. Maybe you liked his wife,
or don't like his drinking.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.200
How can you possibly know
about the drinking?

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.320
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.600
Power connection -
tiny little scuff marks round it.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.120
Every night he plugs it in
but his hands are shaking.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.200
You never see those marks
on a sober man's phone,

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.560
never see a drunk's without them.
There you go, you were right.
I was right? Right about what?

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.840
The police don't consult amateurs.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.320
That...was amazing.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.680
Do you think so? Of course it was.
It was extraordinary,
it was quite extraordinary.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.560
That's not what people normally say.
What do people normally say?

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.040
Piss off!

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.520
Did I get anything wrong?

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.440
Harry and me don't get on,
never have,

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.600
Clara and Harry split up
three months ago

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.680
and they're getting a divorce,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.160
and Harry is a drinker.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.920
Spot on, then. I didn't expect
to be right about everything.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.880
Harry's short for Harriet.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.680
Harry's your sister.
Look, what exactly am I supposed
to be doing here? Sister!

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.120
No - seriously, what am I doing
here? There's always something.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.720
Hello, freak! I'm here to see
Detective Inspector Lestrade.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.240
Why?

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.440
I was invited.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.440
Why?
I think he wants me to take a look.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.960
Well, you know what I think,
don't you? Always Sally.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.040
I even know you didn't
make it home last night.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.880
I don't... Who's this?
Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.680
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.240
Old friend.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.920
A colleague(?)
How do YOU get a colleague?

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.240
Did he follow you home?

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.800
Would it be better
if I just waited... No.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.920
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.560
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.480
It's a crime scene. I don't want it
contaminated. Are we clear on that?

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.600
Quite clear.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.480
And is your wife away for long?

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.160
Oh, don't pretend you worked
that out. Somebody told you that.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.560
Your deodorant told me that.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.680
My deodorant?

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.480
It's for men. Well, of course
it's for men - I'm wearing it.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.720
So's Sergeant Donovan.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.120
Ooh... I think it just vaporised.
May I go in?

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.640
Whatever you're trying to imply...

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:52.480
I'm not implying anything. I'm sure
Sally came round for a nice little
chat, and just happened to stay over.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.160
And I assume she scrubbed
your floors, going by
the state of her knees.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.920
You'll need to wear one of these.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.360
Who's this?

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.920
He's with me.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.560
But who is he? I said he's with me.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.840
Aren't you going to put one on?

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.560
So where are we? Upstairs.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.160
I can give you two minutes.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.480
May need longer.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.160
Her name's Jennifer Wilson
according to her credit cards,

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.840
we're running them now
for contact details.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.600
Hasn't been here long.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.200
Some kids found her.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.600
Shut up.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.080
I didn't say anything.
You were thinking. It's annoying.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.560
Got anything?

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.560
Not much.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.760
She's German.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.320
Rache. It's German for revenge.
She could be trying to
tell us something...

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.280
Yes, thank you for your input.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.560
So she's German? Of course she's
not. She's from out of town though.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.280
Intended to stay in London
for one night

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.440
before returning home to Cardiff.
So far, so obvious.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.480
Sorry - obvious?
What about the message though?

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.960
Dr Watson, what do you think?

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.320
Of the message?
Of the body. You're a medical man.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.920
We have a whole team right outside.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.000
They won't work with me. I'm breaking
every rule letting YOU in here...

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.400
Yes...because you need me.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.760
Yes, I do.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.040
God help me.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.800
Dr Watson! Hm?

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.560
Oh, do as he says. Help yourself.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.440
Anderson, keep everyone out
for a couple of minutes...

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.760
Well? What am I doing here?

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.480
Helping me make a point. I'm supposed
to be helping you pay the rent.
This is more fun.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.800
Fun? There's a woman lying dead.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.320
Perfectly sound analysis,
but I WAS hoping you'd go deeper.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.600
Yeah...

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.200
Asphyxiation, probably.
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.920
Can't smell any alcohol on her.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.120
It could have been a seizure.
Possibly drugs.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.040
You know what it was,
you've read the papers.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.280
Well, she's one of the suicides.
The fourth...?

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.280
Sherlock - two minutes, I said,
I need anything you got.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.880
Victim is in her late 30s.
Professional person,
going by her clothes -

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.160
I'm guessing the media, going by
the frankly alarming shade of pink.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.480
Travelled from Cardiff today
intending to stay in London one night
from the size of her suitcase.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.080
Suitcase? Yes. She's been married
at least ten years, but not happily.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.880
She's had a string of lovers but
none of them knew she was married.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.160
Oh, for God's sake,
if you're just making this up...

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.720
Her wedding ring.
Ten years old at least.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.000
The rest of her jewellery
has been regularly cleaned,
but not her wedding ring.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.800
The inside
is shinier than the outside.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.520
The only polishing it gets
is when she works it off her finger.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.920
It's not for work, look at her nails.
She doesn't work with her hands
so who DOES she remove her rings for?

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.640
Not ONE lover,
she'd never sustain the fiction
of being single for that long

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.600
so more likely a string of them.
Brilliant.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.040
Sorry. Cardiff?

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.280
It's obvious, isn't it?
It's not obvious to me.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.560
Dear God, what is it like
in your funny little brains,
it must be so boring. Her coat -

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.280
it's slightly damp, she's been
in heavy rain the last few hours -

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.000
no rain anywhere in London
in that time.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.640
Under her coat collar is damp too.
She's turned it up against the wind.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.200
She's got an umbrella in her pocket
but it's dry and unused.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.760
Not just wind, strong wind -
too strong to use her umbrella.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.680
We know from her suitcase that
she was intending to stay overnight

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.040
but she can't have travelled more
than two or three hours because
her coat still hasn't dried.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.200
So - where has there been
heavy rain and strong wind within
the radius of that travel time?

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.520
Cardiff.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.840
Fantastic.
Do you know you do that out loud?

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.480
Sorry, I'll shut up.
No, it's...fine.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.520
Why do you keep saying suitcase?
Yes, where is it?

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:45.560
She must have had a phone or
an organiser. Find out who Rachel is.
She was writing Rachel?

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.240
No, she was leaving an angry note
in German - of course she was writing
Rachel, no other word it can be.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.160
Why did she wait until she was dying
to write it? How do you know
she had a suitcase?

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.200
Tiny splash marks on her right heel
and calf not present on the left.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.760
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase
behind her with her right hand,
by that splash pattern.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.920
Smallish case, going by the spread.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.680
Case that size,
woman this clothes-conscious -

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.640
could only be an overnight bag
so we know she was staying one night.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.080
Where is it,
what have you done with it?

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.920
There wasn't a case.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.920
Say that again. There wasn't a case.
There was never any suitcase.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.400
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase?
Was there a suitcase in this house?

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.000
Sir, there was no case!

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.760
But they take the poison themselves,
swallow the pills.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.320
There are clear signs,
even you lot couldn't miss them.
Right, thanks. And...?

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.440
It's murder, all of them.
I don't know how.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.800
But they're not suicides,
they're serial killings.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.160
We've got a serial killer. There's
always something to look forward to.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.200
Why are you saying that?
Her case! Come on, where is her case?

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.160
Did she eat it(?) Someone else
was here, and they took her case.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.280
So the killer must have driven here.
Forgot the case was in the car.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.480
She could have checked into a hotel,
left it there.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.560
No, look at her hair.
She colour-coordinates
her lipstick and her shoes.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.320
She'd never have left any hotel
with her hair still looking...

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.800
Oh...

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.240
Oh!

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.880
Sherlock? What is it, what?

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.600
Serial killers, always hard.
You have to wait for them
to make a mistake.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.760
We can't just wait! Oh, we're done
waiting. Look at her, really look!

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.040
Houston, we have a mistake.
Get on to Cardiff.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.160
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's
family and friends were. Find Rachel!

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.040
Of course, yeah - but what mistake?!

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.160
Pink!

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.000
ANDERSON: Let's get on with it...

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.120
He's gone. Who, Sherlock Holmes?

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.400
Yeah, he just took off.
He does that.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.480
Is he coming back?
Didn't look like it.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.440
Right.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.160
Right...

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.120
Yes. Sorry, where am I?

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.720
Brixton.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.600
Do you know where I could get a cab?

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.840
It's just er...

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.480
well -

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.160
my leg.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.000
Er...

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.120
..try the main road.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.280
Thanks.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.840
But you're not his friend.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.800
He doesn't HAVE friends.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.960
So who are you?

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.840
I'm...I'm nobody. I just met him.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.840
OK, bit of advice then.
Stay away from that guy.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.840
Why?

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.960
You know why he's here?

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.240
He's not paid or anything.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.560
He likes it. He gets off on it.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.000
The weirder the crime, the more
he gets off. And you know what...?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.160
One day just showing up
won't be enough.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.440
One day we'll be standing
round a body and he'll be the one
that put it there.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.520
Why would he do that?
Because he's a psychopath.

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.080
Psychopaths get bored.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.040
LESTRADE: Donovan! Coming.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.520
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.

Er...Anthea.

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.080
Is that your real name? No.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.680
I'm John.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.360
Yes. I know.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.760
Any point in asking...
where I'm going?

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.640
None at all...

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.920
John.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.640
OK.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.440
Have a seat, John.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.840
You know, I've got a phone.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.880
I mean, very clever and all that,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.960
but er...

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.640
you could just phone me.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.080
On my phone.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:06.880
When one is avoiding the attention
of Sherlock Holmes, one learns
to be discreet, hence this place.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.680
Your leg must be hurting you.
Sit down.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.160
I don't want to sit down.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.600
You don't seem very afraid.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.280
You don't seem very frightening.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.920
HE CHUCKLES
Yes...

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.880
The bravery of the soldier.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.440
Bravery is by far the kindest
word for stupidity, don't you think?

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.920
What is your connection
to Sherlock Holmes?

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.560
I don't have one. I barely know him,
I met him...yesterday.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.880
Mmm, and since yesterday you've
moved in with him and now you're
solving crimes together.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.160
Might we expect a happy announcement
by the end of the week?

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.680
Who are you? An interested party.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.640
Interested in Sherlock? Why?

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.720
I'm guessing you're not friends.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.120
You've met him. How many friends
do you imagine he has?

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.760
I am the closest thing to a friend
that Sherlock Holmes is capable of
having. And what's that?

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.440
An enemy. An enemy?

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.320
In HIS mind, certainly.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.960
If you were to ask him,
he'd probably say his arch-enemy.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.840
He does love to be dramatic.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.160
Well, thank God
YOU'RE above all that.

Not distracting me at all.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.960
Do you plan to continue your
association with Sherlock Holmes?

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.240
I could be wrong...

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.760
but I think that's
none of your business.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.480
It could be. It really couldn't.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.400

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.680
I'd be happy to

pay you a meaningful sum of money
on a regular basis to ease your way.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.720
Why?

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.360
Because you're not a wealthy man.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.960
In exchange for what?

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.680
Information.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.160
Nothing indiscreet. Nothing
you'd feel...uncomfortable with.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.920
Just tell me what he's up to. Why?

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.400

That's nice of you.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.520
But I would prefer
for various reasons
that my concern go unmentioned,

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.760

You're very loyal VERY quickly.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.160
No, I'm not,
I'm just not interested.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.040
"Trust issues"...it says here.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.920
What's that?

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.920
Could it be that you've decided to
trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.880
Who says I trust him? You don't seem
the kind to make friends easily.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.680
Are we done?

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.720
You tell me.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.960
I imagine people have already
warned you to stay away from him,

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.160

that's not going to happen.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.760

Most people...blunder round
this city, and all they see
are streets and shops and cars.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.720
When you walk with Sherlock
Holmes, you see the battlefield.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.120
You've seen it already. Haven't you?

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.280
What's wrong with my hand?

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.880
You have an intermittent tremor

Any chance you could not tell him
this is where I went?

Sure. You've told him
already, haven't you?

Yeah.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.520
Bad news for brain work.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.560
It's good news for breathing.
Oh... Breathing! Breathing's boring.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.360
Is that...three patches?

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.160
It's a three-patch problem.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.520
Well...?

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.480
You asked me to come,
I'm assuming it's important.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.640
Oh - yeah, of course.
Can I borrow your phone?

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.520
My phone? Always a chance
that my number will be recognised.
It's on the website.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.480
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.
Yeah, she's downstairs.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.600
I tried shouting but she didn't hear.
I WAS the other side of London...

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.400
There was no hurry.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.840
Here...

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.720
So what's this about - the case?

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.160
Her case... HER case?
Her suitcase, yes, obviously.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.640
The murderer took her suitcase,
first big mistake.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.280
OK, he took her case. So?

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.480
It's no use, there's no other way.
We'll have to risk it.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.000
On my desk there's a number.
I want you to send a text.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.960
You've brought me here...
to send a text.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.480
Text, yes. The number on my desk.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.280
What's wrong?
Just met a friend of yours.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.240
A friend? An enemy.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.720
Oh. Which one?

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.920
Well, your arch-enemy, according to
him. Do people have arch-enemies?

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.640
Did he offer you money to spy on me?

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.520
Yes. Did you take it?

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.520
No. Pity, we could have split the
fee. Think it through next time.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.840
Who is he?
The most dangerous man you've ever
met, and not my problem right now.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.480
On my desk, the number!

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.720
Jennifer Wilson. That was...

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.920
Hang on. Wasn't that the dead woman?

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.800
Yes. That's not important.
Just enter the number.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.240
Are you doing it? Yes.
Have you done it?

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:36.680
Yeah - hang on!

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.320
These words exactly.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.760
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens?

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.560
"I must have blacked out.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.680
"22 Northumberland Street,

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.240
please come." You blacked out?

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.560
What? No... No!

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.320
Type and send it. Quickly.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.400
Have you sent it? What's the address?

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.760
22 Northumberland Street. Hurry up!

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.320
That's...

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.280
That's the pink lady's case,
that's Jennifer Wilson's case.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.640
Yes, obviously.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.360
Oh, perhaps I should mention -
I didn't kill her.
I never said you did.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.480
Why not? Given that text
and the fact I have her case
it's a perfectly logical assumption.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.760
Do people usually assume
you're the murderer?

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.400
Now and then, yes.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.960
OK...

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.200
How did you get this? By looking.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.040
Where? The killer must have
driven her to Lauriston Gardens.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:45.920
He could only keep her case
by accident if it was in the car.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.720
Nobody could be seen with this case
without drawing attention -

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.640
particularly a man,
which is statistically more likely.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.240
So obviously he'd feel compelled
to get rid of it.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.360
Wouldn't have taken him more than
five minutes to realise his mistake.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.040
I checked every backstreet
wide enough for a car
five minutes from Lauriston Gardens,

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.600
'and anywhere you could dispose of a
bulky object without being observed.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.880
'Took me less than an hour
to find the right skip.'

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.080
Pink. You got all that because
you realised the case would be pink?

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.400
It had to be pink, obviously.
Why didn't I think of that(?)

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.000
Because you're an idiot.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.680
No, no, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:23.400
Now, look. Do you see what's missing?

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.600
From the case? How could I?

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.360
Her phone. Where's her mobile phone?

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.880
There was no phone on the body,
there's no phone in the case.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.400
We know she had one.
You just texted it.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.720
Maybe she left it at home.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:37.960
She has a string of lovers
and she's careful about it.
She never leaves her phone at home.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.600
Er...

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.360
Why did I just send that text?

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.760
Well, the question is
where is her phone NOW?

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.360
She could have lost it. Yes, or?

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.280
The murderer... You think
the murderer has the phone?

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:58.560
Maybe she...left it
when she left her case. Maybe
he took it from her for some reason.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.000
Either way,
the balance of probability is
the murderer has her phone.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.560
Sorry...what are we doing -
did I just text a murderer?
What good will that do?

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.840
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.640
A few hours after his last victim,

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.040
and now he receives a text
that can only be from her.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:23.040
If somebody had just found that phone
they'd ignore a text like that,
but the murderer...

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.720
would panic.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:29.920
Have you talked to the police? Four
people are dead, there isn't time.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.640
So why are you talking to ME?

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.400
Mrs Hudson took my skull.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.560
So I'm basically filling in
for your skull?

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.840
Relax, you're doing fine.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:43.120
Well? Well, what? Well - you could
just sit there and...watch telly.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.800
What, you want me to come with you?
I like company when I go out,
and I think better when I talk aloud.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.200
The skull just
attracts attention, so...

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.640
Problem? Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.480
What about her?

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.560
She said...

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.800
you get off on this. You enjoy it.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.400
And I said "dangerous",
and here you are.

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.520
Damn it!

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.920
Where are we going?
Northumberland Street's
a five-minute walk from here.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.480
You think he's stupid enough
to go there?
No - I think he's brilliant enough.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.440
I love the brilliant ones. They're
all so desperate to get caught.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.680
Why? Appreciation!

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.360
Applause! At long last the spotlight.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.080
That's the frailty of genius, John,
it needs an audience. Yeah.

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:39.400
This is his hunting ground.
Right here in the heart of the city.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.760
Now that we know his victims were
abducted, that changes everything.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.720
Because all of his victims
disappeared from busy streets,

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.760
crowded places,
but nobody saw them go.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.080
Think! Who do we trust,
even though we don't know them?

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.440
Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.760
Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.880
Don't know. Who?

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.840
Haven't the faintest. Hungry?

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:07.080
Thank you, Billy.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.240
22 Northumberland Street.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.520
Keep your eyes on it.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.480
He's not just going to ring
the doorbell. He'd need to be mad.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.000
He HAS killed four people.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.520
OK.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.720
Sherlock!

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.280
Anything on the menu,
whatever you want, free.

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.560
On the house, for you
and for your date.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.280
Do you want to eat? I'm not his date.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.480
This man got me off a murder charge.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:40.000
This is Angelo. Three years ago
I proved to Lestrade at the time of
a particularly vicious triple murder

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.080
that Angelo was elsewhere,
house-breaking.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.800
He cleared my name. I cleared it
a bit. Anything happening opposite?

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.000
Nothing.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.800
But for this man, I'd have gone
to prison. You did go to prison.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.520
I'll get a candle for the table.
It's more romantic.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.040
I'm not his date!

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.920
You may as well eat.
We might have a long wait.

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.440
Thanks.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.560
People don't have arch-enemies.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.560
I'm sorry? In real life.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.960
There are no arch-enemies
in real life. Doesn't happen.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.320
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.320
So who did I meet?

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.160
What do real people have, then,
in their..."real lives"?

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.640
Friends?

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.880
People they know, people they like,
people they don't like...

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.760
Girlfriends, boyfriends.
Yes, well, as I was saying - dull.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:38.360
You don't have a girlfriend, then.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.440
Girlfriend? No, not really my area.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.880
Mm.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.480
Oh, right.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:48.080
Do you have a...boyfriend?
Which is fine, by the way.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.160
I know it's fine.

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.000
So you've got a boyfriend then. No.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.840
Right. OK.

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.040
You're unattached. Like me.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.800
Fine. Good.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.680
John, erm...

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.440
I think you should know that
I consider myself married to my work,

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.760
and while I'm flattered,
I'm really not looking for any... No,

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:20.520
I'm...not asking. No.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.480
I'm just saying, it's all fine.

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.920
TAXI OUTSIDE
Good.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.800
Thank you.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.920
Look across the street.
Taxi. It's stopped.

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.840
Nobody getting in,
and nobody getting out.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:40.160
Why a taxi?

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.880
Oh, that's clever. Is it clever?
Why is it clever? That's him.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.040
Don't stare.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.080
You're staring. We can't both stare.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.440
CAR HORN

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.040
Sorry...

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.800
I've got the cab number.
Good for you.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.640
Right turn, one way, roadworks,
traffic lights, bus lane,

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:23.040
pedestrian crossing, left turn only,
traffic lights.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.440
Sorry.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.560
TYRES SQUEAL

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.080
Come on, John...

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.000
Come on, John. We're losing him!

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.520
This way.

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.720
No - THIS way!

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.520
Sorry...

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.360
Police! Open her up.

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.640
SHERLOCK PANTS
No...

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.840
Teeth, tan. What - Californian...?

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.640
LA, Santa Monica. Just arrived.

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.560
How could you possibly know that?
The luggage.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.000
Probably your first trip
to London, right?

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.440
Going by your final destination
and the cabbie's route.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.480
Sorry - are you guys the police?

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.840
Yeah. Everything all right?

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.720
Yeah.

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.800
Welcome to London.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.880
Er, any problems - just let us know.

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:44.120
Basically just a cab that
happened to slow down. Basically.

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.160
Not the murderer.
Not the murderer, no.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.200
Wrong country, good alibi.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.360
As they go.
Hey, where did you get this?

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.600
Detective Inspector Lestrade? Yeah.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.480
I pickpocket him when he's annoying.

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:58.000
You can keep that one,
I've got plenty at the flat.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.760
What?
Nothing, just..."Welcome to London".

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.880
HE SNIGGERS

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.360
Got your breath back?
Ready when you are.

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.520
JOHN PANTS
OK...

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.280
That was ridiculous.

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.800
That was the most
ridiculous thing...I've ever done.

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:28.160
And you invaded Afghanistan.
THEY LAUGH

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.080
That wasn't just me.

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.720
Why aren't we back
at the restaurant?

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:34.960
They can keep an eye out.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.960
It was a long shot anyway.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.880
So what were we doing there?

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.440
Oh, just passing the time.

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.200
And proving a point.

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.760
What point? You.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:51.800
Mrs Hudson! Dr Watson
WILL take the room upstairs.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.280
Says who?

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.880
Says the man at the door.

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:56.200
KNOCKING

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:09.760
Sherlock texted me.
He said you forgot this.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.200
Ah...

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.960
Er, thank you.

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.160
Thank you.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.200
Sherlock, what have you done?

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.320
Mrs Hudson? Upstairs.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.280
What are you doing? Well, I knew
you'd find the case, I'm not stupid.

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:34.480
You can't just break into my flat.
You can't withhold evidence -
and I didn't break in.

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.840
Well, what do you call this then?

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.520
It's a drugs bust.
Seriously? This guy - a junkie?

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.600
Have you met him? John...

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.840
You could search this flat all day,
you wouldn't find anything
you could call recreational.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.080
John, you probably want to
shut up now. But come on...

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.760
No... What?

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:55.800
You?
Shut up! I'm not your sniffer dog.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.040
No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.840
Anderson, what are YOU doing here
on a drugs bust?

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:06.640
Oh, I volunteered. They all did.
They're not strictly speaking ON the
drug squad, but they're very keen.

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.600
Are these human eyes?
Put those back!

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.040
They were in the microwave.
It's an experiment.

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.480
Keep looking, guys.

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.760
Or you could help us properly
and I'll stand them down.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.960
This is childish.
Well, I'm dealing with a child.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:21.000
Sherlock, this is our case.
I'm letting you in,
but you do not go off on your own.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.080
Clear? What - so you set up
a pretend drugs bust to bully me?

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:28.480
It stops being pretend
if we find anything. I am clean!

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.320
Is your flat...? All of it?

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.960
Don't even smoke.

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.160
Neither do I.

00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:38.320
So let's work together.

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.080
We've found Rachel. Who is she?

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.720
Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.

00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.680
Her daughter?

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.240
Why would she write
her daughter's name? Why?

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:49.680
Never mind that, we found the case.

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.480
According to SOMEONE the murderer
has the case, and we found it in the
hands of our favourite psychopath.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:57.680
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Do your research.

00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.360
You need to bring Rachel in
and I need to question her.

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:04.360
She's dead. Excellent.
How, when and why? Is there
a connection? There has to be.

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.520
Well, I doubt it,
since she's been dead for 14 years.
Technically she was never alive.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:13.640
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's
stillborn daughter, 14 years ago.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.000
No, that's...

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.880
..that's not right. How...

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.800
Why would she do that? Why?

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:23.960
Why would she think of her daughter
in her last moments? Yup -
sociopath, I'm seeing it now.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:26.000
She didn't think about her daughter.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.720
She scratched her name on the floor
with her fingernails. She was dying.

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.520
It took effort, it would have hurt.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:37.040
You said that the victims
all took the poison themselves,
that he MAKES them take it -

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:42.120
well, maybe he...I don't know,
talks to them. Maybe he used
the death of her daughter somehow.

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:45.440
Yeah, but that was ages ago.
Why would she still be upset?

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.600
Not good?

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.720
Bit not good, yeah.

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:56.080
If you were dying...
If you'd been murdered - in your very
last few seconds what would you say?

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.960
"Please, God, let me live."
Use your imagination!

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.480
I don't have to.

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.000
Yeah, but if you were clever...
Jennifer Wilson running
all those lovers - she WAS clever.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.840
She's trying to tell us something.

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.520
Isn't the doorbell working?
Your taxi's here, Sherlock.

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:15.040
I didn't order a taxi. Go away.
Oh, dear. They're making such
a mess. What are they looking for?

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.760
It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.880
But they're just for my hip.
They're herbal soothers...

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.000
Shut up, everybody! Don't speak,
don't breathe. I'm trying to think.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.280
Anderson, face the other way.
You're putting me off.

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.840
What? My FACE is(?)
Everybody quiet and still.

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.120
Anderson, turn your back.
Oh, for God's sake!

00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.800
Your back, now, please!

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.800
Come on, think. Quick!
What about your taxi?

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.040
MRS HUDSON!

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.480
Oh...

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.720
Ah!

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:45.280
She was clever. Clever, yes!

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:49.720
She's cleverer than you lot and she's
dead. Do you see, do you get it?

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.320
She didn't lose her phone, she
never lost it. She PLANTED it on him.

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:56.360
When she got out of the car, she
knew that she was going to her death.

00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.480
She left the phone in order to
lead us to her killer. But how?

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.360
What do you mean, how?

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.960
Rachel!

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.880
Don't you see? Rachel!

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.000
Oh...

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.680
Look at you lot.
You're all so vacant.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.480
Is it nice not being me?
It must be so relaxing.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.640
Rachel is not a name.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.520
Then what is it? John -
on the luggage, there's a label.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.600
E-mail address.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.480
Er, jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.760
She didn't have a laptop, which means
she did her business on her phone.
A smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.400
So there was a website
for her account.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.560
The username is her e-mail address -
and all together, the password is?

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:40.840
Rachel.
So we can read her e-mails. So what?

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.840
Anderson, don't talk out loud.
You lower the IQ of the whole street.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.640
We can do much more than that.
It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.440
Which means if you lose it you can
locate it online. She's leading us
directly to the man who killed her.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.560
Unless he got rid of it.
We know he didn't.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:58.080
Come on, come on. Quickly!
Sherlock, dear. This taxi driver...

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.760
Mrs Hudson, isn't it time
for your evening soother?

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.840
Get vehicles, get a helicopter. This
phone battery won't last for ever.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.000
We'll just have a map reference,
not a name. It's a start!

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.520
Sherlock... Narrows it down
from just anyone in London.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.000
It's the first proper lead
that we've had. Sherlock...

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.440
Where is it? Quickly, where?

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:18.440
Here. It's...in 221 Baker Street.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.280
How can it be here?

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.680
How?

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.200
Maybe it was in the case
when you brought it back
and it...fell out somewhere.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.800
What, and I didn't notice it?
Me - I didn't notice?

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.600
Anyway, we texted him
and he called back.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.640
Guys, we're also looking
for a mobile somewhere here,

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.760
belonged to the victim... 'Who do we
trust, even if we don't know them?

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:51.520
'Who passes unnoticed
wherever they go?

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.520
'Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?'

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.320
TEXT MESSAGE ALERT

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.520
Sherlock, you OK? What...?

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.760
Yeah, yeah... I'm fine.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.720
So, how can the phone be here?

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:44.960
Don't know.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.040
I'll try it again. Good idea.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.720
Where are you going?

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:52.200
Fresh air, just popping outside
for a moment. Won't be long.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.320
You sure you're all right? I'm fine.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.200
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.680
I didn't order a taxi.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.800
Doesn't mean you don't need one.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.680
You're the cabbie.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.600
The one who stopped outside
Northumberland Street.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.840
It was you. Not your passenger.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.000
See?
No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
It's like you're invisible.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.800
Just the back of an 'ead.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.480
Proper advantage
for a serial killer.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.800
Is this a confession? Oh, yeah.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.080
I'll tell you what else...

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.120
If you call the coppers now,
I won't run.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.920
I'll sit quiet and they can
take me down, I promise.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.240
Why?

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.200
Cos you're not going to do that.
Am I not?

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.040
I didn't kill those four people,
Mr Holmes.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.200
I spoke to 'em...

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.280
and they killed themselves.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:11.000
If you get the coppers now,
I'll promise you one thing.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.720
I will never tell you what I said.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.520
No-one else will die, though, and
I believe they call that a result.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.520
And you won't ever understand
how those people died.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.880
What kind of result
do you care about?

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.640
If I wanted to understand...

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.520
..what would I do?
Let me take you for a ride.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:56.280
So you can kill me too?
I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.440
I'm going to talk to ya...

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.080
..and then you're
going to kill yourself.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.400
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.840
ENGINE STARTS

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.080
He just got in a cab...
It's Sherlock.
He just drove off in a cab.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.680
I told you, he does that.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.200
He bloody left again.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.920
We're wasting our time!

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.320
I'm...calling the phone,
it's ringing out.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.200
PHONE RINGS

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.040
PHONE KEEPS RINGING

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.240
PHONE KEEPS RINGING

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.040
And if it's ringing, it's not here.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.960
I'll try the search again.
Does it matter? Does any of it?

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:55.760
He's just a lunatic, and he'll
always let you down. And you're
wasting your time. All our time.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.240
OK, everybody...

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.760
done here.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.880
How did you find me?

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.720
Oh, I recognised ya.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.280
Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.400
Sherlock Holmes!

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.880
I was warned about you.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.760
I've been on your website, too.
Brilliant stuff! Loved it.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.400
Who warned you about me? Just
someone out there who's noticed.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.600
Who?

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.440
Who would notice me?

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.640
You're too modest, Mr Holmes.
I'm really not.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.920
Got yourself a fan.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.600
Tell me more.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.280
That's all you're going to know.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.400
In THIS lifetime.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.920
Why did he do that?
Why did he have to leave?

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.280
You know him better than I do.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.520
I've known him for five years -
and no, I don't.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.640
So why do you put up with him?

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.600
Because I'm desperate, that's why.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.320
And because Sherlock Holmes
is a great man -

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.080
and I think one day,
if we're very, very lucky,

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.280
he might even be a good one.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.640
Where are we?

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:47.000
You know every street in London.
You know exactly where we are.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Roland-Kerr
Further Education College.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.960
Why here? It's open.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.840
Cleaners are in.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.040
One thing about being a cabbie -
you always know
a nice quiet spot for a murder.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.120
I'm surprised more of us
don't branch out.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.080
And you just walk your victims in?
How?

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.720
Oh... Dull.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.280
Don't worry. It gets better.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.640
You can't make people take
their own lives at gunpoint. I don't.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:18.440
It's much better than that.

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.520
Don't need this with you.
Cos you'll follow me.

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.960
BEEP

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.280
CONTINUED BEEPING

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.440
Well, what do you think?

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.640
It's up to you.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.480
You're the one
who's going to die here.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.440
No, I'm not.
That's what they all say.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.160
Shall we talk?

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.440
Bit risky, wasn't it?

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.480
Took me away under the eye of
about half a dozen policemen.

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.800
They're not that stupid.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.000
And Mrs Hudson will remember you.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.960
You call that a risk? Nah...

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.000
THIS is a risk.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.360
Oh, I like this bit.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.200
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya?

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.240
But you're about to.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.920
I just have to do this...

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.720
Weren't expecting that, were ya?

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.440
Oh, you're going to love this.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:32.120
Love what?
Sherlock Holmes! Look at you!

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:38.640
Here in the flesh. That website
of yours, your fan told me about it.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.320
My fan?

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.920
You are brilliant.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.320
You are a proper genius.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:49.320
The Science of Deduction.
Now, that...

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.400
is proper thinking.

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.600
Between you and me sitting here,
why can't people think?

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.560
Don't it make you mad?

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.320
Why can't people just think?

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.720
Oh, I see...
So you're a proper genius too.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.920
Don't look it, do I?

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.000
Funny little man driving a cab.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.240
But you'll know better in a minute.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:22.240
Chances are it'll be
the last thing you EVER know.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.720
OK, two bottles. Explain.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.920
There's a good bottle
and a bad bottle.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.520
You take the pill from
the good bottle, you live.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:36.680
You take the pill from
the bad bottle...you die.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.320
Both bottles are of course identical.
In every way.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.280
And you know which is which.
Of course I know. But I don't.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.120
Wouldn't be a game if you knew.
You're the one who chooses.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.120
Why should I? I've got nothing
to go on. What's in it for me?

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.920
I haven't told you the best bit yet.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.120
Whatever bottle YOU choose,

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.800
I take the pill from the other one.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.240
And then together...

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.720
we take our medicine.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.800
I won't cheat. It's your choice.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.200
I'll take whatever pill you don't.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.520
Didn't expect that,
did you, Mr Holmes?

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.080
This is what you did
to the rest of them -

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.480
you gave them a choice?
And now I'm giving you one.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.040
You take your time.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.920
Get yourself together.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.880
I want your best game.
It's not a game, it's chance.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.600
I've played four times. I'm alive.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.480
It's not chance, Mr Holmes,
it's chess.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.080
It's a game of chess,

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.760
with one move...and one survivor.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.600
And this - this...

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.360
is the move.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:01.000
Did I just give you the good bottle
or the bad bottle?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.240
You can choose either one.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.760
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade -
I need to speak to him.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.520
It's important. It's an emergency.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.800
Er, left here, please. Left here...

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.880
You ready yet, Mr Holmes?

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.680
Ready to play? Play what?
It's a 50:50 chance.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.320
You're not playing the numbers,
you're playing ME.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.400
Did I just give you the good pill
or the bad pill?

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.520
Is it a bluff,

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.600
or a double bluff?

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.720
Or a triple bluff?
It's still just chance.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.720
Four people, in a row?
It's not chance.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.400
Luck. It's genius!

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.600
I know how people think.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.560
I know how people think I think.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.000
I can see it all
like a map inside my head.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.320
Everyone's so stupid, even you.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.000
Or maybe God just loves me.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:11.200
Either way,
you're wasted as a cabbie.

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:21.440
So...

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.520
You risked your life four times
just to kill strangers? Why?

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.080
Time to play.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.600
Oh, I am playing.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.800
This is my turn.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.320
There's shaving foam behind your left
ear. Nobody's pointed it out to you.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:42.080
Traces of where it's happened before,
so obviously you live on your own -
there's no-one to tell you.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.000
But there's a photograph of children.
Their mother's been cut out.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.720
If she'd died, she'd still be there.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.680
The photograph's old,
but the frame's new.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.080
You think of your children,
but you don't get to see them.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.400
Estranged father.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.320
She took the kids,

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.760
but you still love them
and it still hurts.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.040
Ah, but there's more.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.080
Your clothes. Recently laundered,

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.800
but everything you're wearing
is at least...three years old?

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.720
Keeping up appearances,
but not planning ahead.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.720
And here you are on a kamikaze
murder spree. What's that about?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.040
Ah...

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.240
Three years ago.
Is that when they told you?

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.600
Told me what?

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.680
That you're a dead man walking.
So are you.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.320
You don't have long, though.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.440
Am I right?

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.800
Aneurism. Right in 'ere.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.680
Any breath could be my last.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.160
And because you're dying,
you've just murdered four people.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.040
I've outlived four people.

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.440
That's the most fun you can have
with an aneurism.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.160
No... No, there's something else.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.160
You didn't just kill four people
because you're bitter.
Bitterness is a paralytic.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:05.160
Love
is a much more vicious motivator.

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:09.800
Somehow, this is about your children.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.200
Oh...

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.680
You ARE good, in't ya? But how?

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.920
When I die they won't get much,
my kids.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.280
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.640
Or serial killing.
You'd be surprised.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.280
Surprise me.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.040
I have a sponsor.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.320
You have a what? For every life
I take, money goes to my kids.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.760
The more I kill...
the better off they'll be.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.840
You see? It's nicer than you think.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.800
Who'd sponsor a serial killer?

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.440
Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes?

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.840
You're not the only one
to enjoy a good murder.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:00.000
There's others out there just
like you, except you're just a man.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.600
And they're so much more than that.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.160
What do you mean...

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.200
more than a man?

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.320
An organisation...? What?

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.560
There's a name, that no-one says.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.360
And I'm not going to say it either.

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:22.160
Now, enough chatter.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.880
Time to choose.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.160
Sherlock?!

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.320
Sherlock!

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.760
What if I don't choose either?
I could just walk out of here.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.760
You can take a 50:50 chance,

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.720
or I can shoot you in the head.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.720
Funnily enough,

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.720
no-one's ever gone for that option.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.760
I'll have the gun, please.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.440
Are you sure?

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:04.240
Definitely. The gun.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.280
You don't want to phone a friend(?)

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.640
The gun.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.320
I know a real gun when I see one.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.520
None of the others did. Clearly.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.960
Well, this has been very interesting.

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.440
I look forward to the court case.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.320
Just before you go,
did you figure it out?

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.880
Which one's the good bottle?

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.040
Course. Child's play.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.320
Well, which one, then?

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.280
Which one would you have picked?

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.400
Just so I know whether
I could have beaten you.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.480
Come on!

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.280
Play the game.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.240
Oh!

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.640
Interesting.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.440
So what do you think?

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.480
Shall we?

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.320
Really... What do you think?

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.160
Can you beat me?

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.440
Are you clever enough...

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.320
..to bet your life?

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.640
FAINTLY: SHERLOCK!

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:55.960
I bet you get bored, don't you?

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.880
I know you do.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.600
A man like you. So clever.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:08.000
But what's the point of being clever
if you can't prove it?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.800
Still the addict.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:16.120
But this...this is what
you're really addicted to.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.520
You'll do anything...

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:24.720
..anything at all,
to stop being bored.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.480
You're not bored now, are ya?

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.800
Isn't it good?

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:31.920
GUNSHOT

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.760
CABBIE GASPS

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.560
Was I right?

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.400
I was, wasn't I?

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.800
Did I get it right?!

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.520
OK... Tell me this.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.360
Your sponsor. Who was it?

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.440
The one who told you about me,
my fan.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.280
I want a name.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.800
No...

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.920
You're dying,
but there's still time to hurt you.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.560
Give me...a name.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.280
HE GASPS

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:18.040
A name! Now.

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.320
The name!

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.000
HE GASPS
MORIARTY!

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.840
SIRENS WAIL

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:49.640
Why have I got this blanket?
They keep putting this blanket on me.

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.360
Yeah, it's for shock.
I'm not in shock.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.040
Yeah, but some of the guys
want to take photographs.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.440
So, the shooter. No sign?

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.560
Cleared off before we got here.
But a guy like that
would have had enemies, I suppose.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.760
One of them could have
been following him, but...

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.840
we've got nothing to go on.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.440
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.600
OK. Give me.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.600
The bullet they just dug
out of the wall's from a handgun.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:19.160
A kill shot over that distance,
that's a crack shot.
But not just a marksman, a fighter.

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:22.800
His hands couldn't have shaken at all
so clearly he's acclimatised
to violence.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:26.680
He didn't fire until I was
in immediate danger though,
so strong moral principle.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:30.760
You're looking for a man
probably with a history
of military service, and...

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.040
nerves of steel...

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:42.080
Actually, do you know what?
Ignore me. Sorry? Ignore all of that.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.800
It's just the er...the shock talking.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.680
Where are you going? I just
need to...talk about the rent.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.080
I've still got questions.
What now? I'm in shock -
look, I've got a blanket.

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:56.320
Sherlock! And, I just caught you
a serial killer... More or less.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.320
OK. We'll pull you in tomorrow,
off you go.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.600
Erm - Sergeant Donovan has...
just been explaining everything.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.640
The two pills...

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.640
Dreadful business, isn't it?
Dreadful.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.840
Good shot.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.120
Yes. Yes, must have been. Through
that window. Well, you'd know.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.600
Need to get the powder burns
out of your fingers.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:33.720
I don't suppose you'd serve time for
this, but let's avoid the court case.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.480
Are you all right?
Yes, of course I'm all right.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.160
Well, you have just killed a man.
Yes...

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.240
That's true, isn't it?

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.520
But he wasn't a very nice man.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.960
No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?
Frankly a bloody awful cabbie.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.920
SHERLOCK CHUCKLES
That's true, he was a bad cabbie.

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.680
You should have seen
the route he took us to get here.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:00.400
Stop it! We can't giggle,
it's a crime scene. Stop it.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.880
Well, you're the one who shot him.
Keep your voice down.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:06.440
Sorry, it's just erm...
nerves, I think. Sorry.

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.760
You were going to take that damn
pill, weren't you? Course I wasn't.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.760
Biding my time. Knew you'd turn up.

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.400
No, you didn't.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:19.120
That's how you get your kicks,
isn't it - you risk your life
to prove you're clever.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:22.080
Why would I do that?
Because you're an idiot.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.240
Dinner? Starving.

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:29.000
End of Baker Street there's
a good Chinese. Stays open till two.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.560
You can tell a good Chinese by the
bottom third of the door handle.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.520
Sherlock... That's him, that's
the man I was talking to you about.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:38.120
I know exactly who that is.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.720
So... Another case cracked.

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:43.240
How very public-spirited.

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.560
Though that's never really
your motivation, is it?

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.240
What are you doing here?

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:49.800
As ever, I'm concerned about you.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.200
Yes, I've been hearing
about your "concern".

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.960
Always so aggressive.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.840
Did it never occur to you that
you and I belong on the same side?

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.920
Oddly enough - no.

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.000
We have more in common
than you'd like to believe.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.120
This petty feud between us
is simply childish.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.880
People will suffer. And you know
how it always upset Mummy.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.680
I upset her?

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.040
Me?

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.360
It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.760
No. No, wait...

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.160
Mummy? Who's Mummy?

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.600
Mother. Our mother.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.280
This is my brother, Mycroft.

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.240
Putting on weight again?

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.680
Losing it, in fact.
He's your brother?

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.560
Course he's my brother.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.120
So he's not... Not what?

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:37.040
I don't know... Criminal mastermind?

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:40.360
Close enough. For goodness' sake.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:42.680
I occupy a minor position
in the British government.

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.560
He IS the British government,
when he's not too busy being
the British secret service

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.200
or the CIA on a freelance basis.

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.800
Good evening, Mycroft. Try not
to start a war before I get home,

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.440
you know what it does
for the traffic.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:00.720
So, when you say you're
concerned about him -
you actually are concerned?

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.240
Yes, of course.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.360
I mean, it actually is
a childish feud?

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.320
He's always been so resentful.

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:11.960
You can imagine
the Christmas dinners. Yeah...

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.000
No... God, no.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.920
I'd better erm...

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:19.080
Hello again.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.320
Hello.
We met earlier on this evening.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.360
Oh! OK. Goodnight.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.000
Goodnight, Dr Watson.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.600
So, dim sum. Mmm!

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.120
I can always predict
the fortune cookies. No, you can't.

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.160
Almost can. You did get shot, though.

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.520
Sorry? In Afghanistan.
There was an actual wound.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.920
Oh. Yeah, shoulder.
Shoulder! I thought so.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.240
No, you didn't. The left one.
Lucky guess. I never guess.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.800
Yes, you do.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:47.440
What are you so happy about?
Moriarty.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:50.600
What's Moriarty?
I've absolutely no idea.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.880
Sir, shall we go?

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.680
Interesting, that soldier fellow.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:00.440
He could be the making
of my brother...

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.080
or make him worse than ever.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.080
Either way, we'd better
upgrade their surveillance status.

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.480
Grade three active.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.480
Sorry, sir - whose status?

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:15.840
Sherlock Holmes, and Dr Watson.
