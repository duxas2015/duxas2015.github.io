MAN OUTSIDE SHOUTS COMMANDS

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,000
Just tell me what happened
from the beginning.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,760
We had been to a bar,

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,480
nice place, and, er, I got chatting
with one of the waitresses,

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,960
and Karen weren't happy with that,
so...when we get back to the hotel,

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,120
we end up having
a bit of a ding-dong.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,960
HE SIGHS

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,480
She's always getting at me,
saying I weren't a real man.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,920
Wasn't a real man.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,320
What?
It's not "weren't", it's "wasn't".

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,040
Go on.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,320
Well...then I don't know
how it happened,

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,720
but suddenly
there's a knife in my hands...

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,280
..and me old man was a butcher,
so I know how to handle knives.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,880
He learned us how to cut up a beast.
Taught.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,080
What?
Taught you how to cut up a beast.

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,280
Yeah, well, then I done it.

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,640
Did it.
Did it! Stabbed her,

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,640
over and over and over, and I looked
down, and she weren't...

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,720
..wasn't...

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
..moving no more.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,480
Any more.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,680
God help me,
I dunno how it happened,
but it was an accident, I swear.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,320
You've got to help me, Mr Holmes!

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Everyone says you're the best.

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,720
Without you...

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,240
I'll get hung for this.

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,440
No, no, Mr Bewick, not at all.

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,840
Hanged, yes.

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,480
DOOR SHUTS, HE SIGHS

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,880
GUNSHOTS

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
What the hell are you doing?!

39
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,600
Bored.
What?!

40
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,520
Bored!
No...

41
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,240
GUNSHOT
Bored!

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,200
GUNSHOT
Bored!

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,480
Don't know what's got into
the criminal classes.

44
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,800
Good job I'm not one of them.
So you take it out on the wall?

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
The wall had it coming.

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,920
What about that Russian case?
Belarus? Open and shut domestic
murder. Not worth my time.

47
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,680
Oh, shame(!)

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Anything in? I'm starving.

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,080
Oh, f...

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,280
There's a head.

51
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,680
A severed head!
Just tea for me, thanks.

52
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,360
No, there's a head in the fridge.
Yes? A bloody head! Well, where else

53
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,600
could I put it?
You don't mind, do you?

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,160
Well...
Got it from Barts morgue.

55
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,280
I'm measuring the coagulation
of saliva after death.

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,400
I see you've written up
the taxi driver case.

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,880
Er...yes.

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,920
A Study In Pink.

59
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,120
Nice.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,600
Well, you know. Pink lady, pink case,

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,920
pink phone. There was a lot of pink.
Did you like it?

62
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,760
Um...no. Why not?
I thought you'd be flattered.

63
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,080
Flattered?! "Sherlock sees through
everything and everyone in seconds.

64
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,080
"What's incredible, though,
is how spectacularly ignorant he is

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,000
"about some things." Hang on,
I didn't mean that...

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,920
Oh, you meant "spectacularly
ignorant" in a nice way(!)

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,400
Look, it doesn't matter to me
who's Prime Minister or... I know.
..who's sleeping with who...

68
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,520
Whether the Earth goes round the sun.
That again! It's not important!

69
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,080
Not impor...?!

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,080
It's primary school stuff.
How can you not know that? Well,
if I ever did, I've deleted it.

71
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,000
Deleted it?

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,040
Listen. This is my hard drive,
and it only makes sense

73
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,240
to put things in there
that are useful. REALLY useful.

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,760
Ordinary people fill their heads
with all kinds of rubbish.

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,760
That makes it hard to get at
the stuff that matters. Do you see?

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,280
But it's the solar system!

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,920
Oh, hell! What does that matter?!
So we go round the sun.
If we went round the moon,

78
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,680
or round and round the garden
like a teddy bear,
it wouldn't make any difference!

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,400
All that matters to me is the work!
Without that, my brain rots!

80
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,760
Put that in your blog!
Or, better still, stop inflicting
your opinions on the world!

81
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,920
DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,120
Where are you going?
Out! I need some air.

83
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,880
Oh, sorry, love! Sorry.

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,240
Ooh-ooh!
Have you two had a little domestic?

85
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Ooh, it's a bit nippy out there.

86
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,000
He should have wrapped himself up
a bit more.

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,160
Look at that, Mrs Hudson.

88
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,960
Quiet.

89
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,800
Calm. Peaceful.

90
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,480
Isn't it hateful?

91
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,600
Oh, I'm sure something
will turn up, Sherlock.

92
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,520
A nice murder. That'll cheer you up.

93
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,400
Mmm. Can't come too soon.

94
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,120
Hey, what have you done
to my bloody wall?!

95
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,080
I'm putting this on your rent,
young man!

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,760
Morning. Oh...m-morning.
See? Told you you should have gone
with the Lilo.

100
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,520
No, no, no, it's fine, I slept fine.
It's very kind of you.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,440
Well, maybe next time I'll let you
kip at the end of my bed, you know.

102
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,200
NEWSREADER: '..which was discovered
mouldering...' What about the time
after that? '..18 months ago.

103
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,520
'Experts are hailing it as
the artistic find of the century...'

104
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,680
Do you want some breakfast?
Love some. Well, make it yourself.
I'm going to have a shower.

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,120
'..It fetched over £20 million.

106
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,200
'This one is anticipated to do even
better. Back now to our main story.

107
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,600
'There's been a massive explosion
in central London.

108
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,960
'As yet, there are no reports
of any casualties, and the police
are unable to say

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,960
'if there's any suspicion
of terrorist involvement.'

110
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,000
Sarah!

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,280
'Police have issued an emergency
number...' Sarah! '..for friends and
relatives.' Sorry! I've got to run!

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,280
Excuse me, can I get through?
Excuse me. Can I get through?

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,320
I live over there.

114
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,480

Sherlock!

115
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,640
Sherlock!

116
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,680
PIZZICATO NOTE
John.

117
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,000
I saw it on the telly. Are you OK?

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,320
Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine.

119
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,240
Gas leak, apparently.
PIZZICATO NOTE

120
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,800
I can't.
Can't?

121
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,360
Stuff I've got on is just too big.
I can't spare the time.

122
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,720
Never mind your usual trivia.
This is of national importance.

123
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
PIZZICATO NOTE
How's the diet?

124
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,160
Fine.

125
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,920
Perhaps you can get
through to him, John.

126
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,960
What? I'm afraid my brother
can be very intransigent.

127
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,360
If you're so keen,
why don't you investigate it?

128
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,080
No. I can't possibly be away from
the office for any length of time.
Not with the Korean elections so...

129
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,400
Well, you don't need to know
about that, do you?

130
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,320
Besides, a case like this,
it requires...legwork.

131
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,960
FALSE NOTE

132
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,760
How's Sarah, John?
How was the Lilo?

133
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,880
Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.

134
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,040
Oh, yes, of course.
How...? Oh, never mind.

135
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,360
Sherlock's business seems to be
booming since you and he became...

136
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,000
pals. What's he like to live with?

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,680
Hellish, I imagine.
I'm never bored.

138
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,640
Good. That's good, isn't it?

139
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,600
Andrew West, known as Westie
to his friends. Civil servant.

140
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,680
Found dead on the tracks
at Battersea station this morning

141
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,320
with his head smashed in.

142
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,120
Jumped in front of a train?

143
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,920
Seems the logical assumption.

144
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,720
But?
But?

145
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,440
Well, you wouldn't be here
if it was just an accident.

146
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Hah!

147
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,040
The MoD is working on a new missile
defence system, the Bruce-Partington
Program it's called.

148
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,480
The plans for it
were on a memory stick.

149
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,400
That wasn't very clever.

150
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,960
It's not the only copy. Oh.
But it is secret.

151
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,160
And missing.

152
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,520
Top secret?

153
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,000
Very. We think West
must have taken the memory stick.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,360
We can't risk it falling
into the wrong hands.

155
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,240
You've got to find those plans,
Sherlock.

156
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,360
Don't make me order you.
I'd like to see you try.

157
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,840
Think it over.

158
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,280
Goodbye, John.
Mm.

159
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,360
See you very soon.

160
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,480
REPEATS RAPID PHRASE

161
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,720
FOOTSTEPS FADE

162
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,160
Why did you lie?

163
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,400
DOOR SHUTS

164
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,880
You've got nothing on.

165
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,680
Not a single case.
That's why the wall took a pounding.

166
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,920
Why did you tell your brother
you were busy? Why shouldn't I?

167
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,560
Oh.

168
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,760
Nice.

169
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,120
Sibling rivalry.

Sherlock Holmes.

172
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,960
Of course. How could I refuse?

173
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,640
Lestrade - I've been summoned.

174
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
Coming?

175
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,920
If you want me to. Of course.

176
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,200
I'd be lost without my blogger.

177
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,720
'You like the funny cases,
don't you?'

178
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,280
The surprising ones.
Obviously.

179
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,000
You'll love this. That explosion.
Gas leak, yes? No.

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,720
No? No. Made to look like one.
What?

181
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,000
Hardly anything left of the place,
except a strongbox.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,200
A VERY strong box,
and inside it was this.

183
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,080
You haven't opened it?
It's addressed to you, isn't it?

184
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,040
We've X-rayed it. It's not
booby-trapped. How reassuring.

185
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
Nice stationery.

186
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,960
Bohemian.

187
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,480
What?

188
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,080
From the Czech Republic.
No fingerprints?

189
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,720
No.

190
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,520
She used a fountain pen.
Parker Duofold, iridium nib.

191
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,000
She?
Obviously.

192
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,640
Obviously.

193
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,280
But that... That's the phone.
The pink phone.

194
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,880
What, from The Study In Pink?
Obviously, it's not the same phone,
but it's supposed to look like...

195
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,480
"Study In Pink"? You read his blog?

196
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,160
Of course. We all do.

197
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,960

It isn't the same phone.
This one's brand-new.

200
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:48,480
Someone's taken trouble to make it
look the same, which means your blog
has a far wider readership.

201
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,400
'You have one new message.'

00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,080
FIVE GREENWICH TIME SIGNAL PIPS

An estate agent's photo
and the bloody Greenwich pips.

207
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,560
It's a warning.
A warning?

208
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,200
Some secret societies
used to send dried melon seeds,

209
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,520
orange pips, things like that -
five pips.

210
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,720
They're warning us
it's going to happen again.

211
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,160
I've seen this place before.
Hang on.

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,280
What's going to happen again?
Boom!

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,920
Mrs Hudson!

214
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,600
You had a look, didn't you,
when you first came
to see about your flat?

215
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,280
The door's been opened, recently.

216
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,160
No, can't be. That's the only key.

217
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,920
I can't get anyone interested
in this flat.

218
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,760
It's the damp, I expect -
that's the curse of basements.

219
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,560
I'd a place once when I was first
married. Mould all up the wall...

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
Oh. Dear me.

the crying woman.

she's just a hostage. No lead there.

I wasn't thinking about leads. You're

Well, Mycroft thinks there is.
He's texted you eight times.

Must be important. Then why didn't
he cancel his dental appointment?

He's not gay!

Why do you have to spoil...? He's
not! With that level of grooming?

287
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,680
Because he puts product in his
hair? I put product in my hair.

You wash your hair,
there's a difference.

Tinted eyelashes, signs of taurine
cream around the frown lines,

those tired, clubber's eyes.

291
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,520
Then there's his underwear.
His underwear?

292
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,480
Visible above the waistline.
Very particular brand.

293
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,440
Plus the suggestive fact that he
left his number under this dish.

294
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,640
I'd say you'd better break it off
now and save yourself the pain.

Charming, well done(!)

296
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,760
Just saving her time.
Isn't that kinder?

00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,880
Kinder? No, no, Sherlock,
that wasn't kind.

Oh... No.
Go on.

I'm not going to let you humiliate me

303
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,760
a second opinion - it's very useful

Fine.

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,480
Oh, they're just a pair of sh...
trainers. Good.

306
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,160
Um...

307
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,240
They're in good nick.
I'd say they were pretty new,

308
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,240
except the sole has been well worn,
so the owner must have had them
for a while.

309
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,320
Er, very '80s.
Probably one of those retro designs.

310
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,640
You're on sparkling form.
What else?

311
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,600
They're quite big. A man's.

312
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,080
But...

313
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,840
But there's traces of a name
inside in felt-tip.

314
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,080
Adults don't write their names
inside their shoes,
so these belong to a kid.

315
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,360
Excellent. What else?

316
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,040
Er...

317
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,040
That's it.
That's it.

318
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,640
How did I do?
Well, John.

319
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Really well.

320
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,680
I mean, you missed almost everything
of importance, but, you know...

321
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,400
The owner loved these.
Scrubbed them clean.

322
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Whitened them. Changed the laces
three...no, four times.

323
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,200
There are traces of flaky skin where
his fingers have come into contact
with them, so he had eczema.

324
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,680
The shoes are more worn on the
inner side, so he had weak arches.

325
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,240
British-made, 20 years old.

326
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,240
20 years? They're not retro,
they're original.

327
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,440
Limited edition -
two blue stripes, 1989.

328
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,160
There's still mud on them.
They look new.

329
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,040
Someone's kept them that way.

330
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,120
Quite a bit of mud caked
on the soles.

331
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,240
Analysis shows it's from Sussex
with London mud overlaying it.

332
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,160
How do you know? Pollen. Clear as a
map reference. South of the river.

333
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,240
This kid came to London from Sussex
20 years ago and left the trainers
behind. What happened to him?

334
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,880
Something bad.

335
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,960
He loved those shoes, remember.
He'd never leave them filthy.

336
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Wouldn't let them go
unless he had to.

337
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,760
So, a child with big feet gets...

338

Oh!

339
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,160
What?

340
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,240
Carl Powers.

341
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,400
Sorry, who?
Carl Powers, John.

342
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,040
What is it?

343
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,720
It's where I began.

344
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,160
1989, kid, champion swimmer, came
from Brighton for a school sports
tournament, drowned in the pool.

345
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,320
Tragic accident. You wouldn't
remember it. But you remember.

346
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,040
Yes. Something fishy about it?

347
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,720
Nobody thought so.

348
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,440
Nobody except me.
I was only a kid myself.
I read about it in the papers.

349
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,960
You started young, didn't you?
The boy, Carl Powers,

350
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,880
had some kind of fit in the water,

351
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,320
but by the time they got him out,
it was too late.

352
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,760
There was something wrong somewhere.
I couldn't get it out of my head.

353
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,720
What? His shoes. What about them?
They weren't there. I made a fuss.

354
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,400
I tried to get the police
interested, but nobody seemed
to think it was important.

355
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,760
He'd left all the rest
of his clothes in his locker,
but there was no sign of his shoes.

356
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,400

Must be a root canal.

Look, he did say...national
importance. Hmm!

365
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,200

What is?

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,160
You are. Queen and country.

I'm not ignoring it.

Um, I was wanting to...

374
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,680
Your brother sent me to collect
more facts

375
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,440
about the stolen plans -
the missile plans.

376
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,080
Did he?
Yes. He's investigating now.

377
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,320
He's, er...investigating away.

378
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,160
I just wondered what else
you could tell me about the dead man.

379
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,240
Er, 27. Clerk at Vauxhall Cross.

380
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,560
MI6.

381
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,320
He was involved in
the Bruce-Partington Program
in a minor capacity.

382
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,040
Security checks A-OK.
No known terrorist affiliations
or sympathies.

383
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,800
Last seen by his fiancee
10.30 yesterday evening.

384
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,560
Lucy, love, I've got to go out.

Westie!

387
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,640
He was found at Battersea, yes.
So he got on the train?

388
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,080
No.
What?

389
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,520
He had an Oyster card...

390
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,960
..but it hadn't been used.
He must have bought a ticket.

391
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,480
Hm. There was no ticket on the body.

392
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,400
Then... How did he end up with
a bashed-in brain on the tracks
at Battersea?

393
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,840
That is the question -

394
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,440
the one I was rather hoping Sherlock
would provide an answer to.

395
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,560

He's fine.

397
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,920
And it is going...very well.

398
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,360

on the planet.

Carl Powers.

404
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,280
Are you saying he was murdered?

405
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,040
Remember the shoelaces?
Mmm.

406
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,640
He suffered from eczema. It would
be easy to introduce the poison
into his medication.

407
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,360
Two hours later he comes to London,
the poison paralyses the muscles
and he drowns.

408
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,160
How come the autopsy didn't pick that
up? It's virtually undetectable.
Nobody was looking for it.

409
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,520
There are still tiny traces of it
in the trainers

410
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,480
from where he put the cream
on his feet.

411

Same old Ian.
Not a care in the world.

00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,160
Sorry... My husband has been
depressed for months. Who are you?

481
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,400
Really strange that he hired a car.
Why would he do that?
It's a bit suspicious, isn't it?

482
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,680
No, it isn't. He forgot to renew
the tax on the car, that's all.

00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,160
Ah, well! That was Ian.

484
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,800
That was Ian all over.
No, it wasn't.

NORMAL VOICE: Wasn't it? Interesting.

486
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,400
Who was that?
Why did you lie to her?

487
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,360
People don't like telling you things
but they love to contradict you.
Past tense, did you notice?

488
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,560
What? I referred to her husband
in the past tense.

489
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,520
She joined in. Bit premature.
They've only just found the car.
You think she murdered her husband?

490
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,480
That's not a mistake
a murderer would make. I see...

491
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
No, I don't. What am I seeing?

492

Yeah, lovely motor.

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,880
But surely you can afford one -
a Mazda, I mean. Yeah, fair point.

No, he was just a client.

505
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,200
He came in here

No, it's sun beds, I'm afraid.

would love it, though - bit of sun.

How much? About a pint.

00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,720
Not about. Exactly a pint.
That was their first mistake.

531
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,880
The blood's Ian Monkford's,
but it's been frozen.

Frozen?
There are clear signs.

533
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,680
I think Ian Monkford gave
a pint of his blood some time ago

534
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,200
and that's what they spread
on the seat. Who did? Janus Cars.
The clue's in the name.

Exactly.

Janus Cars will help you disappear.

Ian Monkford was in trouble -
financial at a guess, he's

if the car he hired was found with
his blood on the driver's seat...

541
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,040
So where is he?
Colombia. Colombia?!

542
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,400
Mr Ewart, of Janus Cars,

543
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,000
had a 20,000 Colombian peso note
in his wallet.

544
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,480
Quite a bit of change, too.

545
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,240
He told us he hadn't been abroad
recently,

546
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,000
but when I asked him about the cars,
I could see his tan line clearly.

That, plus his arm. His arm?

549
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,760
He kept scratching it. Obviously
irritating him, and bleeding.

550
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,800
He'd recently had a booster jab.
Hep-B, probably.
Hard to tell at that distance.

551
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,680
He's just back from settling
Ian Monkford into his new life
in Colombia.

552
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,800
Mrs Monkford cashes in
the life insurance,
and she splits it with Janus Cars.

Mrs Monkford?
Oh, yes. She's in on it too.

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,880
It's more common
than people think.

673
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,280
The tetanus is in the soil,
people cut themselves on rose bushes,
garden forks,

674
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,640
that sort of thing,
and if left un...treated...

675
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,640
I don't know
what I'm going to do now. Right.

676
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,160
I mean, she's left me this place...
which is lovely...

677
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,280
..but it's not the same without her.
That's why...

678
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,600
my paper wanted to get the,
um...the full story
straight from the horse's mouth.

679
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,400
Are you sure it's not too soon?

680
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,560
No. Right.

681
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,840
You fire away.

682
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,640

684
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,320
John. 'Hi. Look, get over here
quickly. I think I'm onto something.

685
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,960
'You'll need to pick up
some stuff first. Got a pen?'

686
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,240
I'll remember.

687
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,760
DOOR CLOSES

688
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,400
That'll be him. What?

689
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,920
Ah, Mr Prince, isn't it?
Yes.

690
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,120
Very good to meet you.
Yes, thank you.

691
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,680
So sorry to hear about...
Yes, yes, very kind.

692
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,360
Shall we, er...?
CLEARS THROAT

693
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,080
You were right, the bacteria
got into her another way.

694
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,720
Oh, yes? Yes.

695
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,600
Right, are we all set?
Er, yes. Shall we, um...?

696
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,120
Not too close. I'm raw from crying.
CAT MIAOWS

697
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,280
Oh, who's this?

698
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,240
Sekhmet. Named after
the Egyptian goddess.

699
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,440
How nice. Was she Connie's?

700
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,520
Yes, a little present
from yours truly.

701
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,760
Sherlock, light reading?

702
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,280
Oh, er...

703
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,480
2.8. Bloody hell!
What are you playing at? Sorry!

704
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,000
You're like Laurel and bloody Hardy,
you two! What's going on?

705
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,960
I think we've got what we came for.
Excuse us. What? Sherlock. What?

706
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,000
We've got deadlines.
But you've not taken anything!

707
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,160
WATSON LAUGHS

708
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,240
Yes! Ooh, yes!

709
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,160
You think it was the cat.
It wasn't the cat.

710
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,240
What? Yes. Yeah, it is.
It must be. It's how he got
the tetanus into her system.

711
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,880
Its paws stink of disinfectant.
Lovely idea.

712
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,320
No, he coated it
onto the claws of her cat.

713
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,320
It's a new pet,
bound to be a bit jumpy around her.

714
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,440
A scratch is almost inevitable.

715
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,560
I thought of it when I saw the
scratches on her arm, but it's too
random and clever for the brother.

716
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,480
He murdered his sister for her
money. Did he? Didn't he?

717
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,160
Nope. It was revenge.

718
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,560
Rev...? Who wanted revenge?
Raoul, the houseboy.

719
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,240
Kenny Prince was the butt
of his sister's jokes.

720
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,360
Virtual bullying campaign. Finally,
he had enough, fell out with her
badly. It's all on the website.

721
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,960
She threatened to disinherit Kenny,
Raoul had grown accustomed to a
certain lifestyle... Wait. Wait!

722
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,400
Wait a second. What about the
disinfectant on the cat's claws?

723
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,840
Raoul keeps a very clean house.
You came through the kitchen door,

724
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,520
saw the state of that floor -
scrubbed within an inch of its life.

725
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,520
You smell of disinfectant.
No, the cat doesn't come into it.

726
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,040
Raoul's internet records do, though.
I hope we can get a cab from here.

727
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,720
CLOCK TICKS

728
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,360
Raoul de Santos is your killer.

729
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,240
Kenny Prince's houseboy.

730
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,640
Second autopsy shows it wasn't
tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince,

731
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,880
it was botulinum toxin.

732
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,400
We've been here before.
Carl Powers. Tut-tut.

733
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,320
Our bomber's repeated himself.
So how'd he do it?

734
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,240
Botox injection. Botox?

735
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,800
Botox is a diluted form
of botulinum. Among other things,

736
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,800
Raoul de Santos
was employed to give Connie
her regular facial injections.

737
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,760
My contact at the Home Office
gave me the complete records
of Raoul's internet purchases.

738
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,520
He's been bulk-ordering Botox
for months.

739
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,400
Bided his time, then upped
the strength to a fatal dose.

740
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,080
Are you sure about this? I'm sure.

741
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,760
All right, my office.

742
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,640
Hey, Sherlock, how long? What?

743
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,320
How long have you known?
Well, this one was quite simple.

744
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,480
And the bomber repeated himself.
That was a mistake.

745
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,480
No, but Sherlock, the hostage,
the old woman, she's been there
all this time!

746
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,920
I knew I could save her.
I also knew that the bomber
had given us 12 hours.

747
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,640
I solved the case quickly, that gave
me time to get on with other things.

748
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,680
Don't you see? We're one up on him.

749
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,000
PHONE RINGS

750
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,600
Hello?

751
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,360
Help me!

752
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,480
Tell us where you are.

753
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,120
Address? 'He was so...'

754
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,960
His voice...

755
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,600
No, no, no, no!
Tell me nothing about him, nothing.

756
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,600
He sounded so soft.

757
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,880
DIALLING TONE

758
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,680
Hello?

759
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,680
Sherlock?

760
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,160
What's happened?

761
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,240
REPORTER: 'The explosion,

762
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,480
'which ripped through several
floors, killing 12 people...'

763
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,800
Old block of flats.
'..caused by a faulty gas main.

764
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,800
'A spokesman
from the utility company...'

765
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,240
He certainly gets about.

766
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,520
Well, obviously I lost that round.

767
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,360
Although technically,
I did solve the case.

768
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,640
He killed the old lady
because she started to describe him.

769
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,640
Just once,
he put himself in the firing line.

770
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,120
What d'you mean?

771
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,720
Well, usually, he...
must stay above it all.

772
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,520
He organises these things,
but no-one ever has direct contact.

773
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,800
What, like the Connie Prince murder,
he arranged that?

774
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,920
So, people come to him
wanting their crimes fixed up,
like booking a holiday?

775
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,960
Novel.

776
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,880
Huh!

777
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,920
CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK

778
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,880
Taking his time this time.

779
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,880
WATSON CLEARS HIS THROAT

780
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,840
Anything on the Carl Powers case?

781
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,120
Nothing.

782
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,440
All the living classmates
check out spotless, no connection.

783
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,560
Maybe the killer was older than Carl?
The thought had occurred.

784
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,200
So why is he doing this, then?

785
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,000
Playing this game with you.
Do you think he wants to be caught?

786
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,440
I think he wants to be distracted.
Oh...

787
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,320
I hope you'll be
very happy together.

788
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,840
Sorry, what?
There are lives at stake, Sherlock.

789
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,200
Actual human lives! Just so I know,
do you care about that at all?

790
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,200
Will caring about them
help save them? Nope.

791
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,920
Then I'll continue not to make
that mistake. And you find that
easy, do you? Yes, very.

792
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,600
Is that news to you? No, no.

793
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,240
I've disappointed you.

794
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,600
That's good,
that's a good deduction, yeah.

795
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,480
Don't make people into heroes, John.

796
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,760
Heroes don't exist, and if they did,
I wouldn't be one of them.

797
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,800
MOBILE PHONE BEEPS
Excellent.

798
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,720
A view of the Thames.

799
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,040
South Bank, somewhere between
Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.

800
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,120
You check the papers,
I'll look online.

801
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,120
Oh, you're angry with me,
so you won't help.

802
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,600
Not much cop, this caring lark.

803

SIREN WAILS

804
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,280
Archway suicide... Ten-a-penny.

805
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,360
Two kids stabbed in Stoke Newington.

806
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,040
Ah, man found on the train line,
Andrew West.

807
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,560
Nothing!

808
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,040
RINGING TONE

809
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,040
It's me. Have you found anything
on the South Bank between Waterloo
Bridge and Southwark Bridge?

BIRDSONG

811
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,440
Do you reckon this is connected,
then, the bomber?

812
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,120
Must be. Odd, though,
he hasn't been in touch.

813
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,480
Then we must assume that some poor
bugger's primed to explode, yeah?

814
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,800
Yes.

815
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,120
Any ideas? Seven, so far.

816
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,600
Seven?

817
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,600
He's dead about 24 hours.

818
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,160
Maybe a bit longer. Did he drown?

819
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,440
Apparently not. Not enough of the
Thames in his lungs. Asphyxiated.

820
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,080
Yes, I'd agree.

821
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,360
There's quite a bit of bruising
around the nose and mouth.

822
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,160
More bruises...

823
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,440
here and here.

824
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,680
Fingertips.

825
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,720
He's late 30s, I'd say,
not in the best condition.

826
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,480
He's been in the river a long while,
the water's destroyed
most of the data.

827
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,600
But I'll tell you one thing,
that lost Vermeer painting's a fake.

828
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,680
What?
We need to identify the corpse,

829
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,160
find out about his friends and...

830
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What
painting? What are you on about?

831
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,840
It's all over the place,
haven't you seen the posters?

832
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,480
Dutch old master, supposed to
have been destroyed centuries ago.

833
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,080
Now it's turned up,
worth £30 million.

834
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,760
OK, so what has that
got to do with the stiff?

835
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,400
Everything.

836
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,240
Have you ever heard of the Golem?
Golem?

837
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,680
It's a horror story, isn't it?
What are you saying?

838
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,640
Jewish folk story,
a gigantic man made of clay -
it's also the name of an assassin.

839
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,760
Real name - Oskar Dzundza.
One of the deadliest assassins
in the world.

840
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,760
That is his trademark style.

841
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,640
So this is a hit? Definitely.

842
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,880
The Golem squeezes the life out of
his victims with his bare hands.

843
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,720
But what has this got to do
with that painting? I don't see...

844
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,400
You do see, you just don't observe!

845
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,160
Yes, all right, all right, girls!
Calm down.

846
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,400
Sherlock, do you want to
take us through it?

847
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,040
What do we know about this corpse?

848
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,560
The killer's not left us with much,
just the shirt and the trousers.

849
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,840
They're pretty formal, maybe
he was going out for the night.

850
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,760
The trousers are heavy duty.
Polyester, nasty,
same as the shirt, cheap.

851
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,520
They're both too big for him. So
some kind of standard-issue uniform.

852
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,320
Dressed for work, then.
What kind of work?

853
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,080
There's a hook on his belt...
for a walkie-talkie.

854
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,880
Tube driver?

855
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,600
Security guard? More likely.

856
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,680
That'll be borne out
by his backside. Backside?!

857
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,920
Flabby, you'd think he'd led
a sedentary life.

858
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,480
Yet the soles of his feet
and the nascent varicose veins
in his legs show otherwise.

859
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,240
So, a lot of walking
and a lot of sitting around.

860
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,680
Security guard's looking good.
The watch helps too.

861
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,760
The alarm shows
he did regular night shifts.

862
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,400
Maybe he just set his alarm
like that the night before he died.

863
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,600
No, no, no. The buttons are stiff,
hardly touched.

864
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,160
He set his alarm like that a long
time ago, his routine never varied.

865
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,880
But there's something else. The
killer must have been interrupted,

866
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,520
otherwise he would have
stripped the corpse completely.

867
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,720
There was some kind of badge
or insignia on the shirt front

868
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,960
that he tore off,
suggesting the dead man
works somewhere recognisable,

869
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,600
some kind of institution.

870
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,440
I found this
inside his trouser pockets.

871
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,200
Sodden by the river,
but still recognisably...

872
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,520
Tickets? Ticket stubs.
He worked in a museum or gallery.
Did a quick check.

873
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,720
The Hickman Gallery has reported
one of its attendants as missing -
Alex Woodbridge.

874
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,600
Tonight, they unveil
the rediscovered masterpiece.

875
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,760
Now, why would anyone
want to pay the Golem

876
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,960
to suffocate a perfectly ordinary
gallery attendant?

877
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,200
Inference, the dead man
knew something about it,

878
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,200
something that would stop the owner
getting paid £30 million.

879
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,960
The pictures are fake. Fantastic.

880
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,200
Meretricious. And a Happy New Year.

881
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,320
Poor sod.

882
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,440
I'd better get my feelers out
for this Golem character.

883
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,920
Pointless, you'll never find him,
but I know a man who can.

884
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,120
Who? Me.

885
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,640
Why hasn't he phoned?
He's broken his pattern. Why?

886
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,960
Waterloo Bridge.
Where now, the gallery?

887
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,880
In a bit.

888
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,800
The Hickman's contemporary art,
isn't it?

889
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,440
Why have they got hold
of an old master? Don't know.

890
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,520
Dangerous to jump to conclusions.

891
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,960
Need data...

892
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,240
Stop!

893
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,440
Can you wait here?

894
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,560
I won't be a moment.

895
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,040
Sherlock?

896
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,720
Change? Any change?

897
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,640
What for? Cup of tea, of course.

898
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,920
Here you go, 50.

899
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,640
Thanks.

900
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,760
What are you doing? Investing.

901
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,360
Now we go to the gallery.
Have you got any cash?

902
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,240
No, I need you to find out all
you can about the gallery attendant.

903
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,080
Lestrade will give you the address.
OK.

904
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,600
We'd been sharing about a year.

905
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,760
Just sharing. Mmm.

906
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,120
May I? Yeah.

907
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,040
Sorry.

908
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,760
Stargazer, was he?

909
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,560
God, yeah. Mad about it.

910
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,280
It's all he ever did
in his spare time.

911
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,760
He was a nice guy, Alex.

912
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,760
I liked him.

913
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,120
He was, er...

914
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,280
never much of a one for hoovering.

915
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,520
What about art?
Did he know anything about that?

916
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,080
It was just a job, you know?

917
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,280
Mmm.

918
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,320
Has anyone else been round
asking about Alex?

919
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,520
No.

920
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,960
We had a break-in, though.

921
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,840
When? Last night.

922
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,960
There was nothing taken.

923
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,920
Oh, there was a message
left for Alex on the land line.

924
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,440
Who was it from?
I can play it for you, if you like.
I'll get the phone. Please.

925
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,040
PHONE BEEPS

926
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,120
WOMAN: 'Oh, should I speak now? Alex?

927
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,920
'Love, it's Professor Cairns.

928
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,960
'Listen, you were right.
You were bloody right.

929
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,200
'Give us a call when...'
DIALLING TONE

930
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,960
Professor Cairns?

931
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,080
No idea, sorry. Mmm.

932
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,400
Can I try and ring back?

933
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,000
No good. I've had other calls since.
Sympathy ones, you know.

934
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,520
PHONE RINGS

935
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,920
Don't you have something to do?

936
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,880
Just admiring the view.

937
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,640
Yes.

938
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,120
Lovely. Now get back to work -
we open tonight.

939
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,880
Doesn't it bother you? What?

940
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,240
That the painting's a fake.

941
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,120
What? It's a fake. It has to be.
It's the only possible explanation.

942
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:15,680
You are in charge, aren't you,
Miss Wenceslas? Who are you?

943
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,760
Alex Woodbridge
knew that the painting was a fake,

944
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,680
so somebody sent the Golem
to take care of him. Was it you?

945
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,640
Golem? What the hell
are you talking about?

946
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,400
Are you working for someone else?
Did you fake it for them?

947
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,880
It's not a fake.

948
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,680
It is a fake. I don't know why.

949
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,960
But there's something wrong with it,
there has to be.

950
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,000
What the hell are you on about?
You know I could have you
sacked on the spot. Not a problem.

951
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,800
No? No, I don't work here, you see.

952
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,080
Just popped in to give you
a bit of friendly advice.

953
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,800
How did you get in?

954
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,000
Please! I want to know.

955
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,320
The art of disguise is knowing
how to hide in plain sight.

956
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,200
Who are you? Sherlock Holmes.

957
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,640
Am I supposed to be impressed?

958
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,880
You should be.

959
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,440
Have a nice day.

960
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,320
DOOR CREAKS THEN SHUTS

961
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,840
WOMAN: He wouldn't.
He just wouldn't.

962
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:18,160
Stranger things have happened.
Westie wasn't a traitor.

963
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,920
That's a horrible thing to say!

964
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,760
I'm sorry.
But you must understand...

965
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,440
That's what they think, isn't it,
his bosses?

966
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,000
He was young man, about to
get married, he had debts.

967
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,760
Everyone's got debts,

968
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,160
and Westie wouldn't want to clear
them by selling out his country.

969
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:39,400
Can you, er...? Can you tell me
exactly what happened that night?

970
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,520
We were having a night in.

971
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,520
Just...watching a DVD.

972
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,960
He normally falls asleep, you know,
but he sat through this one.

973
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,360
He was quiet.

974
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:58,080
Out of the blue he said
he just had to go and see someone.

975
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,320
And you've no idea who?

976
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,760
Hi, Liz. You OK, love?

977
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,920
Yeah. Who's this?

978
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,560
John Watson, hi.
This is my brother, Joe.

979
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,800
John's trying to find out
what happened to Westie, Joe.

980
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,080
You with the police?
Sort of, yeah.

981
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,040
Tell them to get off their arses,
will you? It's bloody ridiculous.

982
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,520
I'll do my best.

983
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,760
CLEARS THROAT
Well, er,

984
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,600
thanks very much for your help.
Again, I'm very, very sorry.

985
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,160
He didn't steal those things,
Mr Watson.

986
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,560
I knew Westie, he was a good man.

987
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,040
He was MY good man.

988
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Spare change? No.

989
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,600
Any spare change?

990
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,960
Alex Woodbridge didn't know
anything special about art.

991
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,600
And? And...

992
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,160
Is that it?
No habits, hobbies, personality?

993
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,440
Give us a chance.
He was an amateur astronomer.

994
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,880
Hold that cab. Spare change,
sir? Don't mind if I do.

995
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,600
WATSON: Can you wait here?

996
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,120
Fortunately, I haven't been idle.
Come on.

997
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,720
Beautiful, isn't it?

998
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:14,360
I thought you didn't care about...
Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it.

999
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:18,160
Listen, Alex Woodbridge had a message
on the answerphone at his flat.

1000
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,160
A Professor Cairns. This way.

1001
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,520
Nice. Nice part of town.

1002
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,680
Any time you want to explain?
Homeless network.

1003
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,800
Really is indispensable.
Homeless network?

1004
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,200
My eyes and ears, all over the city.
Ah, that's...clever.

1005
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,200
So you scratch their backs, and...?
Yes, then disinfect myself.

1006

01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,880
What's he doing sleeping rough?

1008
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,600
Well, he has a very distinctive
look. He has to hide somewhere
where tongues won't wag...much.

1009
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,760
Oh sh... What?

1010
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,920
I wish I... Don't mention it.

he might be going.

1014
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,520

Alex Woodbridge a message.

No, there wasn't that much.

West wasn't killed here, that's
why there was so little blood.

1139
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,760
You don't think
I'd give up on a case like this

1140
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,640

1141
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:31,040

1143
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,080
otherwise Mycroft's people
would have heard about it.

1144
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,360
Despite what people think,
we do still have a secret service.

1145
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,600
Yeah, I know, I've met them.

1146
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,120
Which means whoever stole
the memory stick can't sell it

1147
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,760
or doesn't know what to do with it.

1148
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,640

01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,960

someone in?

1152
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,680
There isn't.

1153
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,680

1154
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,520
Where are we? Oh, sorry, didn't
I say? Joe Harrison's flat.

1155
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,000
Joe...?

1156
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,160
Brother of West's fiancee.
He stole the memory stick,

1157
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,480
killed his prospective
brother-in-law.

1158
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,560

1161
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,760
Don't! Don't.

1162
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
He wasn't meant to...

1163
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,760
What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.

1164
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,040
Why did you kill him?

1165
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,240
It was an accident. I swear it was.

1166
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:23,160
But stealing the plans
for the missile defence program
wasn't an accident, was it?

1167
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,320
I started dealing drugs.

1168
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,240
I mean, the bike thing's
a great cover, right?

1169
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,800
I don't know how it started.

1170
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,240
I just got out of my depth.

1171
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:38,680
I owed people thousands.
Serious people.

1172
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:43,320
Then at Westie's engagement do,
he starts talking about his job.

1173
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,400
I mean, usually, he's so careful.

1174
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:53,280
'But that night, after a few pints,
he really opened up.

1175
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,560
'He told me about these
missile plans.

1176
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,240
'Beyond top secret.

1177
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,120
'He showed me the memory stick,
he waved it in front of me.'

1178
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,880
You hear about these things
getting lost,

1179
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,920
ending up on rubbish tips
and whatnot.

1180
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:10,240
But there it was. And I thought...

1181
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,280
'Well, I thought
it could be worth a fortune.

1182
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,320
'It was pretty easy to get the thing
off him, he was so plastered.'

1183
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,200
Next time I saw him,

1184
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,480
'I could tell by the look on his
face that he knew.'

1185
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,480
What are you doing here?
What have you done with the plans?

1186
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,080
What happened?

1187
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:40,320
'I was going to call an ambulance,
but it was too late.

1188
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:45,720
'I just didn't have a clue what
to do. So I dragged him in 'ere.'

1189
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,000
I just sat in the dark, thinking.

1190
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,440
When a neat little idea
popped into your head.

1191
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,680
Carrying Andrew West way away from
here. His body would have gone on
for ages

1192
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,760
if the train hadn't hit
a stretch of track that curved.

1193
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,880
And points. Exactly.

1194
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,120
Do you still have it, then -
the memory stick?

1195
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,640
Fetch it for me,
if you wouldn't mind.

1196
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,200
Distraction over -
the game continues.

1197
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,840
Maybe that's over, too.
We've heard nothing from the bomber.

1198
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,280
Five pips, remember, John.

1199
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,120
It's a countdown.
We've only had four.

1200
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,680
SHOUTING ON TELEVISION

1201
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:21,320
No, no, no!
Course he's not the boy's father.

1202
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,520
Look at the turn-ups on his jeans!

1203
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,840
I knew it was dangerous. Hm?

1204
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,000
Getting you into crap telly.

1205
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,800
Not a patch on Connie Prince.

1206
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,200
Have you given Mycroft the memory
stick yet? Yep. He was over the moon.

1207
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:41,040
Threatened me with a
knighthood...again.

1208
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,800
You know, I'm still waiting. Hm?

1209
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,760
For you to admit that a little
knowledge of the solar system

1210
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,360
and you'd have cleared up
the fake painting a lot quicker.

1211
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,960
It didn't do you any good, did it?

1212
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:54,520
No, but I'm not the world's
only consulting detective.

1213
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,200
True. I won't be in for tea.

1214
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,320
I'm going to Sarah's. There's still
some of that risotto left in
the fridge.

1215
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,920
Milk, we need milk. I'll get some.

1216
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,680
Really? Really.

1217
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,560
And some beans, then? Mm.

1218
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,200
DOOR CLOSES

1219
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,600
FOOTSTEPS

1220
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,640
Bought you a little
getting-to-know-you present.

1221
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,200
That's what it's all been for,
isn't it?

1222
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,120
All your little puzzles,
making me dance.

1223
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,520
All to distract me from this.

1224
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,120
Evening.

1225
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,680
This is a turn-up, isn't it,
Sherlock?

1226
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,840
John! What the hell...?
Bet you never saw this coming.

1227
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:16,280
What...would you like me
to make him say...next?

1228
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,240
Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear,

1229
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,200
gottle o' gear. Stop it.

1230
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,480
Nice touch, this. The pool,

1231
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,000
where little Carl died.

1232
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,720
I stopped him.
I can stop John Watson, too.

1233
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:39,600
Stop his heart. Who are you?

1234
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,040
DOOR OPENS

1235
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,760
I gave you my number.

1236
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,360
I thought you might call.

1237
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,000
Is that a British Army Browning
L9A1 in your pocket,

1238
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,520
or are you just pleased to see me?

1239
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,840
Both.

1240
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,400
Jim Moriarty. Hi.

1241
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,800
Jim?

1242
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,920
Jim from the hospital?

1243
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,080
Oh, did I really make
such a fleeting impression?

1244
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,440
But then, I suppose,
that was rather the point.

1245
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,720
Don't be silly.
Someone else is holding the rifle.

1246
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,760
I don't like getting my hands dirty.

1247
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:47,320
I've given you a glimpse,
Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse

1248
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:52,000
of what I've got going on
out there in the big bad world.

1249
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,400
I'm a specialist, you see.

1250
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,040
Like you.

1251
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,520
Dear Jim...

1252
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:03,760
..please will you fix it for me

1253
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,040
to get rid of my lover's
nasty sister?

1254
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,880
Dear Jim, please will you fix it for
me to disappear to South America?

1255
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,480
Just so.

1256
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,560
Consulting criminal.

1257
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:19,400
Brilliant. Isn't it?

1258
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,320
No-one ever gets to me.

1259
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,800
And no-one ever will.

1260
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,000
I did.
COCKS GUN

1261
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,320
You've come the closest.
Now you're in my way.

1262
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,160
Thank you.
Didn't mean it as a compliment.

1263
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,320
Yes, you did. Yeah, OK, I did.

1264
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,080
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.

1265
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:38,040
SINGSONG
Daddy's had enough now.

1266
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,520
I've shown you what I can do.

1267
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,440
I cut loose all those people,
all those little problems,

1268
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:48,200
even 30 million quid, just
to get you to come out and play.

1269
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:52,360
So take this as a friendly
warning... my dear.

1270
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,080
Back off.

1271
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,400
Although I have loved this,

1272
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,320
this little game of ours.

1273
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:07,960
Playing Jim from IT. Playing gay.
Did you like
the little touch with the underwear?

1274
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,760
People have died.
That's what people do!

1275
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,600
I will stop you. No, you won't.

1276
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,960
Are you all right?

1277
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,120
You can talk, Johnny boy.

1278
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,520
Go ahead.

1279
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:28,240
Take it. Mm? Oh...

1280
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,600
..that? The missile plans.

1281
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,200
Boring!

1282
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,240
I could have got them anywhere.

1283
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,640
Sherlock, run!

1284
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,160
HE LAUGHS
Good!

1285
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,440
Very good.

1286
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,640
If your sniper pulls that trigger,
Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.

1287
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:57,120
Isn't he sweet? I can see
why you like having him around.

1288
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,040
But then, people do get
so sentimental about their pets.

1289
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,960
They're so touchingly loyal.

1290
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,200
But oops!

1291
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:08,000
You've rather shown
your hand there, Dr Watson.

1292
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,880
Gotcha.

1293
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:24,080
Westwood. Do you know what happens
if you don't leave me alone,
Sherlock? To you?

1294
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,920
Oh, let me guess. I get killed.

1295
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,440
Kill you?

1296
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,840
No, don't be obvious. I mean,
I'm going to kill you anyway,
some day.

1297
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,720
I don't want to rush it, though.

1298
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,920
I'm saving it up for
something special.

1299
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:42,920
No, no, no, no, no.
If you don't stop prying,
I'll burn you.

1300
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:49,920
I'll burn the heart out of you.

1301
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,680
I have been reliably informed
that I don't have one.

1302
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,680
But we both know that's not
quite true.

1303
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,960
Well, I'd better be off.

1304
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:07,240
Well, so nice to have had a
proper chat.

1305
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,080
What if I was to shoot you now?

1306
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,400
Right now?

1307
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,680
Then you could cherish
the look of surprise on my face.

1308
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,480
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.

1309
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,200
Really, I would.

1310
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:23,840
And just a teensy
bit...disappointed.

1311
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,960
And of course, you wouldn't be able
to cherish it for very long.

1312
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:34,000
Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.

1313
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,280
Catch you...later.

1314
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,240
No, you won't!
DOOR CLOSES

1315
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,080
All right? Are you all right?

1316
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:56,240
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Sherlock...

1317
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,080
Sherlock!

1318
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,440
HE GASPS

1319
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,280
Oh, Christ.

1320
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:20,280
Are you OK?
Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine.

1321
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:26,720
That, er...thing that you...
that you did,

1322
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:32,240
that, um...you offered to do...
that was, um...good.

1323
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:37,720
I'm glad no-one saw that. Mm?

1324
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,800
You ripping my clothes off
in a darkened swimming pool.

1325
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,880
People might talk.

1326
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,720
They do little else.

1327
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,800
Oh...
Sorry, boys. I'm so changeable!

1328
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,560
It is a weakness with me,
but to be fair to myself,

1329
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,360
it is my only weakness.

1330
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,200
You can't be allowed to continue.

1331
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,800
You just can't.

1332
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,360
I would try to convince you,

1333
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,240
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

1334
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,480
Probably my answer has
crossed yours.
