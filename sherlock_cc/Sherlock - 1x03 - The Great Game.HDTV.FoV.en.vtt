MAN OUTSIDE SHOUTS COMMANDS

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.000
Just tell me what happened
from the beginning.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.760
We had been to a bar,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.480
nice place, and, er, I got chatting
with one of the waitresses,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.960
and Karen weren't happy with that,
so...when we get back to the hotel,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.120
we end up having
a bit of a ding-dong.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.960
HE SIGHS

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.480
She's always getting at me,
saying I weren't a real man.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.920
Wasn't a real man.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.320
What?
It's not "weren't", it's "wasn't".

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.000
Oh.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.040
Go on.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.320
Well...then I don't know
how it happened,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.720
but suddenly
there's a knife in my hands...

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.280
..and me old man was a butcher,
so I know how to handle knives.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.880
He learned us how to cut up a beast.
Taught.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.080
What?
Taught you how to cut up a beast.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.280
Yeah, well, then I done it.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.640
Did it.
Did it! Stabbed her,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.640
over and over and over, and I looked
down, and she weren't...

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.720
..wasn't...

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.880
..moving no more.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.480
Any more.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.680
God help me,
I dunno how it happened,
but it was an accident, I swear.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.320
You've got to help me, Mr Holmes!

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.320
Everyone says you're the best.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.720
Without you...

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.240
I'll get hung for this.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.440
No, no, Mr Bewick, not at all.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.840
Hanged, yes.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.720

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.880
GUNSHOTS

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.160
What the hell are you doing?!

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.600
Bored.
What?!

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.520
Bored!
No...

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.240
GUNSHOT
Bored!

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.200
GUNSHOT
Bored!

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.480
Don't know what's got into
the criminal classes.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.800
Good job I'm not one of them.
So you take it out on the wall?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.600
The wall had it coming.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.920
What about that Russian case?
Belarus? Open and shut domestic
murder. Not worth my time.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.680
Oh, shame(!)

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.240
Anything in? I'm starving.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.080
Oh, f...

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.280
There's a head.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.680
A severed head!
Just tea for me, thanks.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.360
No, there's a head in the fridge.
Yes? A bloody head! Well, where else

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.600
could I put it?
You don't mind, do you?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.160
Well...
Got it from Barts morgue.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.280
I'm measuring the coagulation
of saliva after death.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.400
I see you've written up
the taxi driver case.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.880
Er...yes.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.920
A Study In Pink.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.120
Nice.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.600
Well, you know. Pink lady, pink case,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.920
pink phone. There was a lot of pink.
Did you like it?

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.760
Um...no. Why not?
I thought you'd be flattered.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.080
Flattered?! "Sherlock sees through
everything and everyone in seconds.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.080
"What's incredible, though,
is how spectacularly ignorant he is

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.000
"about some things." Hang on,
I didn't mean that...

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.920
Oh, you meant "spectacularly
ignorant" in a nice way(!)

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.400
Look, it doesn't matter to me
who's Prime Minister or... I know.
..who's sleeping with who...

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.520
Whether the Earth goes round the sun.
That again! It's not important!

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.080
Not impor...?!

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.080
It's primary school stuff.
How can you not know that? Well,
if I ever did, I've deleted it.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.000
Deleted it?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.040
Listen. This is my hard drive,
and it only makes sense

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.240
to put things in there
that are useful. REALLY useful.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.760
Ordinary people fill their heads
with all kinds of rubbish.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.760
That makes it hard to get at
the stuff that matters. Do you see?

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.280
But it's the solar system!

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.920
Oh, hell! What does that matter?!
So we go round the sun.
If we went round the moon,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.680
or round and round the garden
like a teddy bear,
it wouldn't make any difference!

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.400
All that matters to me is the work!
Without that, my brain rots!

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.760
Put that in your blog!
Or, better still, stop inflicting
your opinions on the world!

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.920
DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.120
Where are you going?
Out! I need some air.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.880
Oh, sorry, love! Sorry.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.240
Ooh-ooh!
Have you two had a little domestic?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.440
Ooh, it's a bit nippy out there.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.000
He should have wrapped himself up
a bit more.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.160
Look at that, Mrs Hudson.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.960
Quiet.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.800
Calm. Peaceful.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.480
Isn't it hateful?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.600
Oh, I'm sure something
will turn up, Sherlock.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.520
A nice murder. That'll cheer you up.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.400
Mmm. Can't come too soon.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.120
Hey, what have you done
to my bloody wall?!

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.080
I'm putting this on your rent,
young man!

Morning. Oh...m-morning.
See? Told you you should have gone
with the Lilo.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.520
No, no, no, it's fine, I slept fine.
It's very kind of you.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.440
Well, maybe next time I'll let you
kip at the end of my bed, you know.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.200
NEWSREADER: '..which was discovered
mouldering...' What about the time
after that? '..18 months ago.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.520
'Experts are hailing it as
the artistic find of the century...'

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.680
Do you want some breakfast?
Love some. Well, make it yourself.
I'm going to have a shower.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.120
'..It fetched over £20 million.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.200
'This one is anticipated to do even
better. Back now to our main story.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.600
'There's been a massive explosion
in central London.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.960
'As yet, there are no reports
of any casualties, and the police
are unable to say

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.960
'if there's any suspicion

Sarah!

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.280
'Police have issued an emergency
number...' Sarah! '..for friends and
relatives.' Sorry! I've got to run!

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.280
Excuse me, can I get through?
Excuse me. Can I get through?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.320
I live over there.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.480
DOOR BANGS
Sherlock!

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.640
Sherlock!

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.680
PIZZICATO NOTE
John.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.000
I saw it on the telly. Are you OK?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.320
Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.240
Gas leak, apparently.
PIZZICATO NOTE

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.800
I can't.
Can't?

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.360
Stuff I've got on is just too big.
I can't spare the time.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.720
Never mind your usual trivia.
This is of national importance.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.280
PIZZICATO NOTE
How's the diet?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.160
Fine.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.920
Perhaps you can get
through to him, John.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.960
What? I'm afraid my brother
can be very intransigent.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.360
If you're so keen,
why don't you investigate it?

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.080
No. I can't possibly be away from
the office for any length of time.
Not with the Korean elections so...

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.400
Well, you don't need to know
about that, do you?

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.320
Besides, a case like this,
it requires...legwork.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.960
FALSE NOTE

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.760
How's Sarah, John?
How was the Lilo?

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.880
Sofa, Sherlock. It was the sofa.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.040
Oh, yes, of course.
How...? Oh, never mind.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.360
Sherlock's business seems to be
booming since you and he became...

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.000
pals. What's he like to live with?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.680
Hellish, I imagine.
I'm never bored.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.640
Good. That's good, isn't it?

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.600
Andrew West, known as Westie
to his friends. Civil servant.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.680
Found dead on the tracks
at Battersea station this morning

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.320
with his head smashed in.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.120
Jumped in front of a train?

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.920
Seems the logical assumption.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.720
But?
But?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.440
Well, you wouldn't be here
if it was just an accident.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.440
Hah!

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.040
The MoD is working on a new missile
defence system, the Bruce-Partington
Program it's called.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.480
The plans for it
were on a memory stick.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.400
That wasn't very clever.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.960
It's not the only copy. Oh.
But it is secret.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.160
And missing.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.520
Top secret?

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.000
Very. We think West
must have taken the memory stick.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.360
We can't risk it falling
into the wrong hands.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.240
You've got to find those plans,
Sherlock.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.360
Don't make me order you.
I'd like to see you try.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.840
Think it over.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.280
Goodbye, John.
Mm.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.360
See you very soon.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.480
REPEATS RAPID PHRASE

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.720
FOOTSTEPS FADE

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.160
Why did you lie?

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.400
DOOR SHUTS

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.880
You've got nothing on.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.680
Not a single case.
That's why the wall took a pounding.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.920
Why did you tell your brother
you were busy? Why shouldn't I?

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.560
Oh.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.760
Nice.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.120
Sibling rivalry.
Now we're getting somewhere.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.880
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.800
Sherlock Holmes.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.960
Of course. How could I refuse?

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.640
Lestrade - I've been summoned.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.240
Coming?

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.920
If you want me to. Of course.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.200
I'd be lost without my blogger.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.720
'You like the funny cases,
don't you?'

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.280
The surprising ones.
Obviously.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.000
You'll love this. That explosion.
Gas leak, yes? No.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.720
No? No. Made to look like one.
What?

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.000
Hardly anything left of the place,
except a strongbox.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.200
A VERY strong box,
and inside it was this.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.080
You haven't opened it?
It's addressed to you, isn't it?

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.040
We've X-rayed it. It's not
booby-trapped. How reassuring.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.880
Nice stationery.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.960
Bohemian.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.480
What?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.080
From the Czech Republic.
No fingerprints?

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.720
No.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.520
She used a fountain pen.
Parker Duofold, iridium nib.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.000
She?
Obviously.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.640
Obviously.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.280
But that... That's the phone.
The pink phone.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.880
What, from The Study In Pink?
Obviously, it's not the same phone,
but it's supposed to look like...

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.480
"Study In Pink"? You read his blog?

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.160
Of course. We all do.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.960
Do you REALLY not know that
the Earth goes round the sun?

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.000
SHE SNIGGERS

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.520
It isn't the same phone.
This one's brand-new.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:48.480
Someone's taken trouble to make it
look the same, which means your blog
has a far wider readership.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.400
'You have one new message.'

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.080
FIVE GREENWICH TIME SIGNAL PIPS

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.280
Was that it?
No, that's not it.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.320
PHONE BEEPS

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.040
What the hell
are we supposed to make of that?

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.960
An estate agent's photo
and the bloody Greenwich pips.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.560
It's a warning.
A warning?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.200
Some secret societies
used to send dried melon seeds,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.520
orange pips, things like that -
five pips.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.720
They're warning us
it's going to happen again.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.160
I've seen this place before.
Hang on.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.280
What's going to happen again?
Boom!

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.920
Mrs Hudson!

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.600
You had a look, didn't you,
when you first came
to see about your flat?

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.280
The door's been opened, recently.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.160
No, can't be. That's the only key.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.920
I can't get anyone interested
in this flat.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.760
It's the damp, I expect -
that's the curse of basements.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.560
I'd a place once when I was first
married. Mould all up the wall...

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.360
Oh. Dear me.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.360
Shoes.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.360
He's a bomber, remember.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.840
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.040
SOFTLY: Hello.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.440
RAGGED BREATHING OVER PHONE

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.360
WOMAN: 'H-Hello...sexy.'

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.720
Who's this?
WOMAN SOBS

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.760
'I've...sent you...a little puzzle,

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.560
'just to say hi.'

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.680
Who's talking? Why are you crying?

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.880
WOMAN CRIES

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.280
'I...I'm not crying.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.000
'I'm typing.'

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.200
And this...stupid bitch

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.400
is reading it out.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.880
The curtain rises.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.680
What?
Nothing. No, what did you mean?

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.520
I've been expecting this
for some time.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.480
SOBBING: '12 hours to solve...'

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.360
..my puzzle, Sherlock...

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.280
or I'm going to be...

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.200
..so...naughty.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.040
So, who do you suppose it was?
Hmm?

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.680
Woman on the phone -
the crying woman.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.960
Oh, she doesn't matter,
she's just a hostage. No lead there.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.520
I wasn't thinking about leads. You're
not going to be much use to her.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.480
Are they trying to trace it -
trace the call?

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.080
Bomber's too smart for that.
MOBILE BEEPS
Pass my phone.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.760
Where is it? Jacket.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.360
Careful!

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.160
Text from your brother.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.840
Delete it. Delete it? Plans are out
of the country. Nothing we can do.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.680
Well, Mycroft thinks there is.
He's texted you eight times.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.440
Must be important. Then why didn't
he cancel his dental appointment?

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.840
His what?
Mycroft never texts if he can talk.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.040
Andrew West stole the missile plans,
tried to sell them,
got his head smashed in,

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.120
end of story.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.200
The only mystery is why my brother
is so determined to bore me when
somebody is being so interesting.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.200
Try and remember
there's a woman who might die.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.320
What for? There's hospitals
full of people dying, Doctor.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.360
Why don't you go and cry
by their bedside
and see what good it does them?

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.160
COMPUTER BEEPS
Ah!

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.320
Any luck?
Oh, yes!

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:12.520
Oh, sorry. I didn't...
Jim, hi! Come in! Come in!

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.040
Jim, this is Sherlock Holmes.
Ah.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.800
And, er... Sorry.
John Watson. Hi.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.880
Hi. So you're Sherlock Holmes.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.800
Molly's told me all about you.
You on one of your cases?

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.680
Jim works in IT, upstairs.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.760
That's how we met. Office romance.
JIM CHUCKLES

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.840
Gay.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.240
Sorry, what?
Nothing. Um, hey.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.000
Hi.
CLATTERING

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.560
Sorry. Sorry!

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.000
Well, I'd better be off.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.720
I'll see you at the Fox.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.320
About sixish?
Yeah.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.680
Bye.
Bye.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.920
It was nice to meet you.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.240
You too.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.600
DOOR OPENS

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.160
What do you mean, gay?
We're together.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.040
Domestic bliss must suit you, Molly.
You've put on 3lb
since I last saw you.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.800
Two-and-a-half. No, three.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.680
Sherlock.
He's not gay!

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.520
Why do you have to spoil...? He's
not! With that level of grooming?

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.680
Because he puts product in his
hair? I put product in my hair.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.200
You wash your hair,
there's a difference.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.640
Tinted eyelashes, signs of taurine
cream around the frown lines,

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.640
those tired, clubber's eyes.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.520
Then there's his underwear.
His underwear?

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.480
Visible above the waistline.
Very particular brand.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.440
Plus the suggestive fact that he
left his number under this dish.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.640
I'd say you'd better break it off
now and save yourself the pain.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.360
DOOR OPENS
Charming, well done(!)

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.760
Just saving her time.
Isn't that kinder?

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.880
Kinder? No, no, Sherlock,
that wasn't kind.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.920
Go on, then.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.560
Hm?

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.520
You know what I do. Off you go.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.000
Oh... No.
Go on.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.480
I'm not going to let you humiliate me
while I... An outside eye,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.760
a second opinion - it's very useful
to me. Yeah, right(!) Really!

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.080
Fine.
CLEARS THROAT

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.480
Oh, they're just a pair of sh...
trainers. Good.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.160
Um...

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.240
They're in good nick.
I'd say they were pretty new,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.240
except the sole has been well worn,
so the owner must have had them
for a while.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.320
Er, very '80s.
Probably one of those retro designs.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.640
You're on sparkling form.
What else?

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.600
They're quite big. A man's.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.080
But...

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.840
But there's traces of a name
inside in felt-tip.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.080
Adults don't write their names
inside their shoes,
so these belong to a kid.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.360
Excellent. What else?

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.040
Er...

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.040
That's it.
That's it.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.640
How did I do?
Well, John.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.640
Really well.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.680
I mean, you missed almost everything
of importance, but, you know...

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.400
The owner loved these.
Scrubbed them clean.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.800
Whitened them. Changed the laces
three...no, four times.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:23.200
There are traces of flaky skin where
his fingers have come into contact
with them, so he had eczema.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.680
The shoes are more worn on the
inner side, so he had weak arches.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.240
British-made, 20 years old.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.240
20 years? They're not retro,
they're original.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.440
Limited edition -
two blue stripes, 1989.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.160
There's still mud on them.
They look new.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.040
Someone's kept them that way.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.120
Quite a bit of mud caked
on the soles.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.240
Analysis shows it's from Sussex
with London mud overlaying it.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.160
How do you know? Pollen. Clear as a
map reference. South of the river.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.240
This kid came to London from Sussex
20 years ago and left the trainers
behind. What happened to him?

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.880
Something bad.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.960
He loved those shoes, remember.
He'd never leave them filthy.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.960
Wouldn't let them go
unless he had to.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.760
So, a child with big feet gets...

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.880
Oh!

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.160
What?

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.240
Carl Powers.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.400
Sorry, who?
Carl Powers, John.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.040
What is it?

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.720
It's where I began.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:30.160
1989, kid, champion swimmer, came
from Brighton for a school sports
tournament, drowned in the pool.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.320
Tragic accident. You wouldn't
remember it. But you remember.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.040
Yes. Something fishy about it?

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.720
Nobody thought so.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.440
Nobody except me.
I was only a kid myself.
I read about it in the papers.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.960
You started young, didn't you?
The boy, Carl Powers,

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.880
had some kind of fit in the water,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.320
but by the time they got him out,
it was too late.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.760
There was something wrong somewhere.
I couldn't get it out of my head.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.720
What? His shoes. What about them?
They weren't there. I made a fuss.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.400
I tried to get the police
interested, but nobody seemed
to think it was important.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.760
He'd left all the rest
of his clothes in his locker,
but there was no sign of his shoes.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.400
Until now.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.760
CLOCK TICKS

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.480
SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.640
Can I help?

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.040
I want to help.
There's only five hours left.
MOBILE BEEPS

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.880
It's your brother.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.560
He's texting me now.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.960
How does he know my number?
Must be a root canal.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.840
Look, he did say...national
importance. Hmm!

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.200
How quaint!
What is?

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.160
You are. Queen and country.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.000
You can't just ignore it.
I'm not ignoring it.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.640
Putting my best man onto it
right now.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.680
Right, good!
CLEARS THROAT

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.280
Who's that?

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.040
John, how nice! I was hoping
it wouldn't be long.
How can I help you?

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.680
Thank you.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.440
Um, I was wanting to...

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.680
Your brother sent me to collect
more facts

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.440
about the stolen plans -
the missile plans.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.080
Did he?
Yes. He's investigating now.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.320
He's, er...investigating away.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.160
I just wondered what else
you could tell me about the dead man.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.240
Er, 27. Clerk at Vauxhall Cross.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.560
MI6.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.320
He was involved in
the Bruce-Partington Program
in a minor capacity.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.040

10.30 yesterday evening.

Lucy, love, I've got to go out.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.600
I've got to see someone.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.360
Westie!

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.640
He was found at Battersea, yes.
So he got on the train?

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.080
No.
What?

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.520
He had an Oyster card...

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.960
..but it hadn't been used.
He must have bought a ticket.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.480
Hm. There was no ticket on the body.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.400
Then... How did he end up with
a bashed-in brain on the tracks
at Battersea?

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.840
That is the question -

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.440
the one I was rather hoping Sherlock
would provide an answer to.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.560
How's he getting on?

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.520
He's fine.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.920
And it is going...very well.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.360
He's, um...
He's completely focused on it.

What are you going on about?

Clostridium botulinum.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.560
It's one of the deadliest poisons
on the planet.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.680
Carl Powers.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.280
Are you saying he was murdered?

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.040
Remember the shoelaces?
Mmm.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.640
He suffered from eczema. It would
be easy to introduce the poison
into his medication.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.360
Two hours later he comes to London,
the poison paralyses the muscles
and he drowns.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.160
How come the autopsy didn't pick that
up? It's virtually undetectable.
Nobody was looking for it.

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.520
There are still tiny traces of it
in the trainers

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.480
from where he put the cream
on his feet.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:45.440
That's why they had to go.
So how do we let the bomber know?
Get his attention, stop the clock.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.600
The killer kept the shoes
all these years. Yes.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.080

He's our bomber.

The car was hired yesterday morning
by an Ian Monkford.
Banker of some kind.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.240
City boy. Paid in cash.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.480
Told his wife he was going away
on a business trip, never arrived.

Yes. Sorry, but I've already spoken

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.680

Very old friend of your husband's.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.800
we grew up together.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.240
I'm sorry. Who? I don't think
he ever mentioned you.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.440
Oh, he must have done. This is...

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.440
This is horrible.
I mean, I just can't believe it.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.360
I only saw him the other day.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.880
Same old Ian.
Not a care in the world.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:58.160
Sorry... My husband has been
depressed for months. Who are you?

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.400
Really strange that he hired a car.
Why would he do that?
It's a bit suspicious, isn't it?

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.680
No, it isn't. He forgot to renew
the tax on the car, that's all.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.160
Ah, well! That was Ian.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.800
That was Ian all over.
No, it wasn't.

People don't like telling you things
but they love to contradict you.
Past tense, did you notice?

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.560
What? I referred to her husband
in the past tense.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.520
She joined in. Bit premature.
They've only just found the car.
You think she murdered her husband?

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.480
That's not a mistake
a murderer would make. I see...

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.880
No, I don't. What am I seeing?
SALLY: Fishing.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.120

a Mazda, I mean. Yeah, fair point.

He came in here
and hired one of my cars.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.400
I've no idea what happened to him.

No, it's sun beds, I'm afraid.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.840
Too busy to get away. My wife
would love it, though - bit of sun.

Not about. Exactly a pint.
That was their first mistake.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.880
The blood's Ian Monkford's,
but it's been frozen.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.440
Frozen?
There are clear signs.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.680
I think Ian Monkford gave
a pint of his blood some time ago

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.200

on the seat. Who did? Janus Cars.

Ian Monkford was in trouble -
financial at a guess, he's

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.840
But if he were to vanish,

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.360

Mr Ewart, of Janus Cars,

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.000
had a 20,000 Colombian peso note
in his wallet.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.480
Quite a bit of change, too.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.240
He told us he hadn't been abroad
recently,

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.000
but when I asked him about the cars,
I could see his tan line clearly.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.480

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.440
That, plus his arm. His arm?

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.760
He kept scratching it. Obviously
irritating him, and bleeding.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.800
He'd recently had a booster jab.
Hep-B, probably.
Hard to tell at that distance.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.680
He's just back from settling
Ian Monkford into his new life
in Colombia.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.800
Mrs Monkford cashes in
the life insurance,

Oh, yes. She's in on it too.

Not any more.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.200
Dead two days. According to one
of her staff, Raoul de Santos,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.680
she cut her hand on a rusty nail
in the garden. Nasty wound.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.240
REPORTER: 'The explosion,

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.480
'which ripped through several
floors, killing 12 people...'

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.800
Old block of flats.
'..caused by a faulty gas main.

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.800
'A spokesman
from the utility company...'

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.240
He certainly gets about.

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.520
Well, obviously I lost that round.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.360
Although technically,
I did solve the case.

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.640
He killed the old lady
because she started to describe him.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.640
Just once,
he put himself in the firing line.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.120
What d'you mean?

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.720
Well, usually, he...
must stay above it all.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.520
He organises these things,
but no-one ever has direct contact.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:10.800
What, like the Connie Prince murder,
he arranged that?

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.920
So, people come to him
wanting their crimes fixed up,
like booking a holiday?

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.960
Novel.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.880
Huh!

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.920
CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.880
Taking his time this time.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.880
WATSON CLEARS HIS THROAT

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.840
Anything on the Carl Powers case?

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.120
Nothing.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.440
All the living classmates
check out spotless, no connection.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.560
Maybe the killer was older than Carl?
The thought had occurred.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.200
So why is he doing this, then?

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.000
Playing this game with you.
Do you think he wants to be caught?

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.440
I think he wants to be distracted.
Oh...

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.320
I hope you'll be
very happy together.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:04.840
Sorry, what?
There are lives at stake, Sherlock.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.200
Actual human lives! Just so I know,
do you care about that at all?

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.200
Will caring about them
help save them? Nope.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.920
Then I'll continue not to make
that mistake. And you find that
easy, do you? Yes, very.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.600
Is that news to you? No, no.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.240
I've disappointed you.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.600
That's good,
that's a good deduction, yeah.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.480
Don't make people into heroes, John.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.760
Heroes don't exist, and if they did,
I wouldn't be one of them.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.800
MOBILE PHONE BEEPS
Excellent.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.720
A view of the Thames.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:39.040
South Bank, somewhere between
Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.120
You check the papers,
I'll look online.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.120
Oh, you're angry with me,
so you won't help.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.600
Not much cop, this caring lark.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.520
SIREN WAILS

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.280
Archway suicide... Ten-a-penny.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.360
Two kids stabbed in Stoke Newington.

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:23.040
Ah, man found on the train line,
Andrew West.

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.560
Nothing!

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.040
RINGING TONE

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:32.040
It's me. Have you found anything
on the South Bank between Waterloo
Bridge and Southwark Bridge?

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.200
BIRDSONG

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.440
Do you reckon this is connected,
then, the bomber?

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.120
Must be. Odd, though,
he hasn't been in touch.

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.480
Then we must assume that some poor
bugger's primed to explode, yeah?

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.800
Yes.

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.120
Any ideas? Seven, so far.

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.600
Seven?

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.600
He's dead about 24 hours.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:43.160
Maybe a bit longer. Did he drown?

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.440
Apparently not. Not enough of the
Thames in his lungs. Asphyxiated.

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:48.080
Yes, I'd agree.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:52.360
There's quite a bit of bruising
around the nose and mouth.

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.160
More bruises...

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.440
here and here.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.680
Fingertips.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.720
He's late 30s, I'd say,
not in the best condition.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.480
He's been in the river a long while,
the water's destroyed
most of the data.

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.600
But I'll tell you one thing,
that lost Vermeer painting's a fake.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.680
What?
We need to identify the corpse,

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.160
find out about his friends and...

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.640
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What
painting? What are you on about?

00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.840
It's all over the place,
haven't you seen the posters?

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.480
Dutch old master, supposed to
have been destroyed centuries ago.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.080
Now it's turned up,
worth £30 million.

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.760
OK, so what has that
got to do with the stiff?

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.400
Everything.

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.240
Have you ever heard of the Golem?
Golem?

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.680
It's a horror story, isn't it?
What are you saying?

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:44.640
Jewish folk story,
a gigantic man made of clay -
it's also the name of an assassin.

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.760
Real name - Oskar Dzundza.
One of the deadliest assassins
in the world.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.760
That is his trademark style.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.640
So this is a hit? Definitely.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:54.880
The Golem squeezes the life out of
his victims with his bare hands.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.720
But what has this got to do
with that painting? I don't see...

00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.400
You do see, you just don't observe!

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.160
Yes, all right, all right, girls!
Calm down.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:05.400
Sherlock, do you want to
take us through it?

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.040
What do we know about this corpse?

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.560
The killer's not left us with much,
just the shirt and the trousers.

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:16.840
They're pretty formal, maybe
he was going out for the night.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:20.760
The trousers are heavy duty.
Polyester, nasty,
same as the shirt, cheap.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.520
They're both too big for him. So
some kind of standard-issue uniform.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.320
Dressed for work, then.
What kind of work?

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.080
There's a hook on his belt...
for a walkie-talkie.

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.880
Tube driver?

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.600
Security guard? More likely.

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.680
That'll be borne out
by his backside. Backside?!

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.920
Flabby, you'd think he'd led
a sedentary life.

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:40.480
Yet the soles of his feet
and the nascent varicose veins
in his legs show otherwise.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:44.240
So, a lot of walking
and a lot of sitting around.

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.680
Security guard's looking good.
The watch helps too.

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.760
The alarm shows
he did regular night shifts.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.400
Maybe he just set his alarm
like that the night before he died.

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.600
No, no, no. The buttons are stiff,
hardly touched.

00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.160
He set his alarm like that a long
time ago, his routine never varied.

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.880
But there's something else. The
killer must have been interrupted,

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.520
otherwise he would have
stripped the corpse completely.

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.720
There was some kind of badge
or insignia on the shirt front

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.960
that he tore off,
suggesting the dead man
works somewhere recognisable,

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.600
some kind of institution.

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.440
I found this
inside his trouser pockets.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.200
Sodden by the river,
but still recognisably...

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:18.520
Tickets? Ticket stubs.
He worked in a museum or gallery.
Did a quick check.

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:22.720
The Hickman Gallery has reported
one of its attendants as missing -
Alex Woodbridge.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.600
Tonight, they unveil
the rediscovered masterpiece.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.760
Now, why would anyone
want to pay the Golem

00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.960
to suffocate a perfectly ordinary
gallery attendant?

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.200
Inference, the dead man
knew something about it,

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.200
something that would stop the owner
getting paid £30 million.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.960
The pictures are fake. Fantastic.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:42.200
Meretricious. And a Happy New Year.

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.320
Poor sod.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.440
I'd better get my feelers out
for this Golem character.

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.920
Pointless, you'll never find him,
but I know a man who can.

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.120
Who? Me.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.640
Why hasn't he phoned?
He's broken his pattern. Why?

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.960
Waterloo Bridge.
Where now, the gallery?

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.880
In a bit.

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:11.800
The Hickman's contemporary art,
isn't it?

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.440
Why have they got hold
of an old master? Don't know.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.520
Dangerous to jump to conclusions.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.960
Need data...

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.240
Stop!

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.440
Can you wait here?

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.560
I won't be a moment.

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.040
Sherlock?

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.720
Change? Any change?

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.640
What for? Cup of tea, of course.

00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.920
Here you go, 50.

00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.640
Thanks.

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.760
What are you doing? Investing.

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.360
Now we go to the gallery.
Have you got any cash?

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.240
No, I need you to find out all
you can about the gallery attendant.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:38.080
Lestrade will give you the address.
OK.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.600
We'd been sharing about a year.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.760
Just sharing. Mmm.

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.120
May I? Yeah.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.040
Sorry.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.760
Stargazer, was he?

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.560
God, yeah. Mad about it.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.280
It's all he ever did
in his spare time.

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.760
He was a nice guy, Alex.

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.760
I liked him.

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:28.120
He was, er...

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.280
never much of a one for hoovering.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.520
What about art?
Did he know anything about that?

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.080
It was just a job, you know?

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:39.280
Mmm.

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.320
Has anyone else been round
asking about Alex?

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.520
No.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.960
We had a break-in, though.

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.840
When? Last night.

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:52.960
There was nothing taken.

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:57.920
Oh, there was a message
left for Alex on the land line.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:02.440
Who was it from?
I can play it for you, if you like.
I'll get the phone. Please.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.040
PHONE BEEPS

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.120
WOMAN: 'Oh, should I speak now? Alex?

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.920
'Love, it's Professor Cairns.

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:15.960

You were bloody right.

No idea, sorry. Mmm.

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.400
Can I try and ring back?

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:30.000
No good. I've had other calls since.
Sympathy ones, you know.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.520
PHONE RINGS

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.920
Don't you have something to do?

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:57.880
Just admiring the view.

00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.640
Yes.

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.120
Lovely. Now get back to work -
we open tonight.

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.880
Doesn't it bother you? What?

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.240
That the painting's a fake.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.120
What? It's a fake. It has to be.
It's the only possible explanation.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.680
You are in charge, aren't you,
Miss Wenceslas? Who are you?

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.760
Alex Woodbridge
knew that the painting was a fake,

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.680
so somebody sent the Golem
to take care of him. Was it you?

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.640
Golem? What the hell
are you talking about?

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.400
Are you working for someone else?
Did you fake it for them?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.880
It's not a fake.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.680
It is a fake. I don't know why.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.960
But there's something wrong with it,
there has to be.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.000
What the hell are you on about?
You know I could have you
sacked on the spot. Not a problem.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.800
No? No, I don't work here, you see.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.080
Just popped in to give you
a bit of friendly advice.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.800
How did you get in?

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.000
Please! I want to know.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.320
The art of disguise is knowing
how to hide in plain sight.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.200
Who are you? Sherlock Holmes.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.640
Am I supposed to be impressed?

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.880
You should be.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.440
Have a nice day.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.320
DOOR CREAKS THEN SHUTS

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.840
WOMAN: He wouldn't.
He just wouldn't.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:18.160
Stranger things have happened.
Westie wasn't a traitor.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.920
That's a horrible thing to say!

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:22.760
I'm sorry.
But you must understand...

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.440
That's what they think, isn't it,
his bosses?

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.000
He was young man, about to
get married, he had debts.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.760
Everyone's got debts,

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:34.160
and Westie wouldn't want to clear
them by selling out his country.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.400
Can you, er...? Can you tell me
exactly what happened that night?

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.520
We were having a night in.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.520
Just...watching a DVD.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.960
He normally falls asleep, you know,
but he sat through this one.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.360
He was quiet.

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:58.080
Out of the blue he said
he just had to go and see someone.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.320
And you've no idea who?

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.760
Hi, Liz. You OK, love?

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.920
Yeah. Who's this?

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.560
John Watson, hi.
This is my brother, Joe.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.800
John's trying to find out
what happened to Westie, Joe.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.080
You with the police?
Sort of, yeah.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.040
Tell them to get off their arses,
will you? It's bloody ridiculous.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.520
I'll do my best.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.760
CLEARS THROAT
Well, er,

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.600
thanks very much for your help.
Again, I'm very, very sorry.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.160
He didn't steal those things,
Mr Watson.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.560
I knew Westie, he was a good man.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.040
He was MY good man.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.200
Spare change? No.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.600
Any spare change?

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.960
Alex Woodbridge didn't know
anything special about art.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.600
And? And...

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.160
Is that it?
No habits, hobbies, personality?

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.440
Give us a chance.
He was an amateur astronomer.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.880
Hold that cab. Spare change,
sir? Don't mind if I do.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.600
WATSON: Can you wait here?

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.120
Fortunately, I haven't been idle.
Come on.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.720
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.360
I thought you didn't care about...
Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.160
Listen, Alex Woodbridge had a message
on the answerphone at his flat.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.160
A Professor Cairns. This way.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.520
Nice. Nice part of town.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.680
Any time you want to explain?
Homeless network.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.800
Really is indispensable.
Homeless network?

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:37.200
My eyes and ears, all over the city.
Ah, that's...clever.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.200
So you scratch their backs, and...?
Yes, then disinfect myself.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.880
Sherlock! Come on!

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.880
What's he doing sleeping rough?

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:11.600
Well, he has a very distinctive
look. He has to hide somewhere
where tongues won't wag...much.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.760
Oh sh... What?

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.920
I wish I... Don't mention it.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.280
No! No! No! No!
TYRES SQUEAL

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.520
It'll take us weeks
to find him again.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.200
Or not. I have an idea where
he might be going.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.520
What? I told you, someone left
Alex Woodbridge a message.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:39.000
There can't be that many Professor
Cairns in the book. Come on.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:49.800
'Jupiter, the fifth planet in our
solar system, and the largest.

'Jupiter is a gas giant. Planet

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.280

That painting has been subjected to
every test known to science.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.920
It's a very good fake, then.

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.880
You know about this, don't you?
This is you, isn't it?

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.520
Inspector, my time is being wasted.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.760
Would you mind showing yourself
and your friends out?

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:07.280

The painting is a fake.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:13.040
It's a fake, that's why Woodbridge
and Cairns were killed.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.200
Oh, come on, proving it's just
a detail. The painting is a fake.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.200
I've solved it, I've figured it out.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.160
It's a fake, that's the answer,
that's why they were killed.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.400
OK, I'll prove it. Give me time.
Will you give me time?

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.080
CLOCK STARTS TICKING
'Ten...' It's a kid.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.920
Oh God, it's a kid.
What did he say? "Ten."

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.120
'Nine...' It's a countdown.
He's giving me time.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.680
Jesus... It's a fake,
but how can I prove it? How?! How?!

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.880
'Eight...'

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:46.920
This kid will die. Tell me
why the painting is a fake. Tell me!

'Seven...' No, shut up.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.240
Don't say anything.
It only works if I figure it out.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.680
It must be possible.
It must be staring me in the face.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.120
'Six...' How?

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.480
Woodbridge knew, but how?!
'Five...'

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.320

Van Buren Supernova, so-called.

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.640
Exploding star.
Only appeared in the sky in 1858.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.720
So how could it have been...

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.720

You know, it's interesting.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.280
an assassin named after a Prague
legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.360
This whole case has a distinctly
Czech feeling about it.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.800
Is that where this leads?

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.560
What are we looking at, Inspector?

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.280
Well, criminal conspiracy, fraud,

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.560
accessory after the fact,
at the very least.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.960
The murder of the old woman,
all the people in the flat...

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.360
I didn't know anything about that.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.000
All those things, please,
believe me.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.800
I just wanted my share.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.320

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.920
Brushwork, immaculate.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.520
Could fool anyone. Mmm.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.040
Well, nearly anyone.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.200
But I didn't know how to go about
convincing the world the picture
was genuine.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.520
It was just an idea.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.760
A spark which he blew into a flame.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.480
Who?

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.080
I don't know.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.120
put in touch with people.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.760
His people...

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.560
Well, there was never any real
contact.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.440
Just messages...

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:35.560
..whispers.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.800
And did those whispers have a name?

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.800
Moriarty.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.760
WATSON: So this is where West was
found? Yeah.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.120
Are you going to be long?
I might be.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.120
Are you the police, then?
Sort of.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.960
I hate 'em. The police?

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.560
No, jumpers.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:19.280
People who chuck 'emselves in
front of trains. Selfish bastards.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.080
Well, that's one way of looking
at it.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.560
I mean it. It's all right for them.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.520
It's over in a split second,
strawberry jam all over the lines.
What about the drivers, eh?

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.680
They've got to live with it,
haven't they?

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.680
Yeah, speaking of strawberry jam,
there's no blood on the line.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.360
Has it been cleaned off?
No, there wasn't that much.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:41.840
You said his head was smashed in.
It was, but there wasn't much blood.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:49.480
OK.
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.840
Just give us a shout when
you're off. Right.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:13:00.680
Right, so, Andrew West...got on
the train somewhere. Or did he?

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.320
There was no ticket on the body.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.760
How did he end up here?

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.960
I knew you'd get there eventually.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.600
West wasn't killed here, that's
why there was so little blood.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.840
How long have you been following
me? Since the start.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.760
You don't think
I'd give up on a case like this

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.640
just to spite my brother, do you?

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:31.040
Come on,
we've got a bit of burglary to do.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.440
Missile defence plans
haven't left the country,

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.080
otherwise Mycroft's people
would have heard about it.

we do still have a secret service.

Yeah, I know, I've met them.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.120
Which means whoever stole
the memory stick can't sell it

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.760
or doesn't know what to do with it.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.640
My money's on the latter.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.240
We're here.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.880
Where?

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.960
Sherlock! What if there's
someone in?

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.680
There isn't.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:14.680
WATSON: Jesus...

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.520
Where are we? Oh, sorry, didn't
I say? Joe Harrison's flat.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.000
Joe...?

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.160
Brother of West's fiancee.
He stole the memory stick,

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.480
killed his prospective
brother-in-law.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.560
Then why did he do it?

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.520
KEYS RATTLING

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.040
Let's ask him.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.760
Don't! Don't.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
He wasn't meant to...

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.760
What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.040
Why did you kill him?

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.240
It was an accident. I swear it was.

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:23.160
But stealing the plans
for the missile defence program
wasn't an accident, was it?

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.320
I started dealing drugs.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.240
I mean, the bike thing's
a great cover, right?

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.800
I don't know how it started.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.240
I just got out of my depth.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:38.680
I owed people thousands.
Serious people.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:43.320
Then at Westie's engagement do,
he starts talking about his job.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.400
I mean, usually, he's so careful.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.280
'But that night, after a few pints,
he really opened up.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.560
'He told me about these
missile plans.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.240
'Beyond top secret.

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.120
'He showed me the memory stick,
he waved it in front of me.'

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.880
You hear about these things
getting lost,

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.920
ending up on rubbish tips
and whatnot.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.240
But there it was. And I thought...

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.280
'Well, I thought
it could be worth a fortune.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.320
'It was pretty easy to get the thing
off him, he was so plastered.'

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.200
Next time I saw him,

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.480
'I could tell by the look on his
face that he knew.'

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.480
What are you doing here?
What have you done with the plans?

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.080
What happened?

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.320
'I was going to call an ambulance,
but it was too late.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.720
'I just didn't have a clue what
to do. So I dragged him in 'ere.'

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:49.000
I just sat in the dark, thinking.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.440
When a neat little idea
popped into your head.

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.680
Carrying Andrew West way away from
here. His body would have gone on
for ages

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:40.760
if the train hadn't hit
a stretch of track that curved.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.880
And points. Exactly.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.120
Do you still have it, then -
the memory stick?

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.640
Fetch it for me,
if you wouldn't mind.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.200
Distraction over -
the game continues.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.840
Maybe that's over, too.
We've heard nothing from the bomber.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.280
Five pips, remember, John.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.120
It's a countdown.
We've only had four.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.680
SHOUTING ON TELEVISION

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.320
No, no, no!
Course he's not the boy's father.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.520
Look at the turn-ups on his jeans!

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.840
I knew it was dangerous. Hm?

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.000
Getting you into crap telly.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.800
Not a patch on Connie Prince.

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.200
Have you given Mycroft the memory
stick yet? Yep. He was over the moon.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.040
Threatened me with a
knighthood...again.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.800
You know, I'm still waiting. Hm?

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.760
For you to admit that a little
knowledge of the solar system

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.360
and you'd have cleared up
the fake painting a lot quicker.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.960
It didn't do you any good, did it?

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.520
No, but I'm not the world's
only consulting detective.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.200
True. I won't be in for tea.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.320
I'm going to Sarah's. There's still
some of that risotto left in
the fridge.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.920
Milk, we need milk. I'll get some.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.680
Really? Really.

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.560
And some beans, then? Mm.

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.200
DOOR CLOSES

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.600
FOOTSTEPS

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.640
Bought you a little
getting-to-know-you present.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.200
That's what it's all been for,
isn't it?

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.120
All your little puzzles,
making me dance.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.520
All to distract me from this.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.120
Evening.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.680
This is a turn-up, isn't it,
Sherlock?

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:02.840
John! What the hell...?
Bet you never saw this coming.

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:16.280
What...would you like me
to make him say...next?

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.240
Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear,

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.200
gottle o' gear. Stop it.

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.480
Nice touch, this. The pool,

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.000
where little Carl died.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.720
I stopped him.
I can stop John Watson, too.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.600
Stop his heart. Who are you?

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.040
DOOR OPENS

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.760
I gave you my number.

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:46.360
I thought you might call.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:04.000
Is that a British Army Browning
L9A1 in your pocket,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.520
or are you just pleased to see me?

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.840
Both.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.400
Jim Moriarty. Hi.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.800
Jim?

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.920
Jim from the hospital?

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.080
Oh, did I really make
such a fleeting impression?

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:30.440
But then, I suppose,
that was rather the point.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.720
Don't be silly.
Someone else is holding the rifle.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.760
I don't like getting my hands dirty.

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:47.320
I've given you a glimpse,
Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:52.000
of what I've got going on
out there in the big bad world.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.400
I'm a specialist, you see.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.040
Like you.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.520
Dear Jim...

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.760
..please will you fix it for me

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.040
to get rid of my lover's
nasty sister?

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.880
Dear Jim, please will you fix it for
me to disappear to South America?

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.480
Just so.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.560
Consulting criminal.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:19.400
Brilliant. Isn't it?

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.320
No-one ever gets to me.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.800
And no-one ever will.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.000
I did.
COCKS GUN

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.320
You've come the closest.
Now you're in my way.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.160
Thank you.
Didn't mean it as a compliment.

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.320
Yes, you did. Yeah, OK, I did.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.080
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:38.040
SINGSONG
Daddy's had enough now.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:40.520
I've shown you what I can do.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.440
I cut loose all those people,
all those little problems,

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.200
even 30 million quid, just
to get you to come out and play.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:52.360
So take this as a friendly
warning... my dear.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.080
Back off.

01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.400
Although I have loved this,

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.320
this little game of ours.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.960
Playing Jim from IT. Playing gay.
Did you like
the little touch with the underwear?

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.760
People have died.
That's what people do!

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.600
I will stop you. No, you won't.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.960
Are you all right?

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.120
You can talk, Johnny boy.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.520
Go ahead.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:28.240
Take it. Mm? Oh...

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.600
..that? The missile plans.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.200
Boring!

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:41.240
I could have got them anywhere.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.640
Sherlock, run!

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.160
HE LAUGHS
Good!

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.440
Very good.

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:53.640
If your sniper pulls that trigger,
Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:57.120
Isn't he sweet? I can see
why you like having him around.

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.040
But then, people do get
so sentimental about their pets.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.960
They're so touchingly loyal.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.200
But oops!

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:08.000
You've rather shown
your hand there, Dr Watson.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.880
Gotcha.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:24.080
Westwood. Do you know what happens
if you don't leave me alone,
Sherlock? To you?

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.920
Oh, let me guess. I get killed.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.440
Kill you?

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.840
No, don't be obvious. I mean,
I'm going to kill you anyway,
some day.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.720
I don't want to rush it, though.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.920
I'm saving it up for
something special.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:42.920
No, no, no, no, no.
If you don't stop prying,
I'll burn you.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:49.920
I'll burn the heart out of you.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.680
I have been reliably informed
that I don't have one.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:56.680
But we both know that's not
quite true.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.960
Well, I'd better be off.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:07.240
Well, so nice to have had a
proper chat.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.080
What if I was to shoot you now?

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.400
Right now?

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.680
Then you could cherish
the look of surprise on my face.

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:17.480
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.200
Really, I would.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:23.840
And just a teensy
bit...disappointed.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.960
And of course, you wouldn't be able
to cherish it for very long.

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:34.000
Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.280
Catch you...later.

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.240
No, you won't!
DOOR CLOSES

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:52.080
All right? Are you all right?

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.240
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Sherlock...

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.080
Sherlock!

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:01.440
HE GASPS

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.280
Oh, Christ.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.280
Are you OK?
Me? Yeah, fine. I'm fine. Fine.

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.720
That, er...thing that you...
that you did,

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:32.240
that, um...you offered to do...
that was, um...good.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.720
I'm glad no-one saw that. Mm?

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.800
You ripping my clothes off
in a darkened swimming pool.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.880
People might talk.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:45.720
They do little else.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.800
Oh...
Sorry, boys. I'm so changeable!

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:58.560
It is a weakness with me,
but to be fair to myself,

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.360
it is my only weakness.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.200
You can't be allowed to continue.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.800
You just can't.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.360
I would try to convince you,

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:12.240
but everything I have to say
has already crossed your mind.

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:19.480
Probably my answer has
crossed yours.
