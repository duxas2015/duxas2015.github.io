WEBVTT

00:00:05.022 --> 00:00:07.917
AS NEW EMPLOYEES
I'D LIKE YOUR OPINION
ON OUR COMMERCIAL.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.459
I'VE PAID TO HAVE IT AIRED
DURING THE SUPER BOWL.

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:13.445
- WOW.
- NOT ON THE SAME CHANNEL,
OF COURSE.

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:19.251
Interplanetary deliveries...
what a headache.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.598
Evans, where is that
package from Earth?

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:24.956
Uh...

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:26.975
I'm not Evans!

00:00:27.044 --> 00:00:29.895
He should have used
Planet Express.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:33.582
When those
other companies aren't brave
or foolhardy enough to go

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.570
trust Planet Express
for reliable, on-time delivery.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.725
Here's your package,
Mr. Horrible Gelatinous Blob.

00:00:43.794 --> 00:00:45.343
Good work, Evans.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.313
You've got a future around here.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:52.300
Thank you, sir.

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:53.847
Planet Express.

00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:55.404
Our crew is replaceable,

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.106
your package isn't.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:00.843
ARE THERE REALLY
GIANT BIRDS LIKE THAT?

00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:03.846
NO, NO, THAT WAS ALL
JUST SPECIAL EFFECTS.

00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:05.680
NOW, LET'S
HAVE BREAKFAST.

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:07.882
I HOPE EVERYONE LIKES EGGS.

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.996
I'M NEVER GOING TO GET USED
TO THE 31st CENTURY.

00:01:55.065 --> 00:01:56.714
CAFFEINATED BACON?

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.717
BACONATED GRAPEFRUIT?

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.185
ADMIRAL CRUNCH?

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.920
WELL, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.487
TRY SOME ARCHDUKE CHOCULA.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.924
AH, HERMES.

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:07.792
CREW, MEET HERMES CONRAD.

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:10.194
HE MANAGES
MY DELIVERY BUSINESS.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:14.015
PAYS THE BILLS, NOTIFIES
NEXT OF KIN, WHAT HAVE YOU.

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:15.611
SOMEONE COME
AND DROP THIS PACKAGE

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.901
THROUGH THE SLOT LAST NIGHT.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.631
NOW, WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS THE CAPTAIN?

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:21.923
OH, MY. I HAVEN'T PICKED
A NEW CAPTAIN YET.

00:02:21.992 --> 00:02:24.326
IT'S ALWAYS SO HARD TO CHOOSE.

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.594
OOH. OOH-OOH,
OOH-OOH-OOH.

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:31.232
MMM... YOU.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.664
OKAY, CAPTAIN,
THIS IS JUST

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:36.120
A STANDARD LEGAL RELEASE

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.290
PROTECTING PLANET EXPRESS
FROM LAWSUITS IN THE EVENT

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.536
OF THE UNFORESEEN.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.861
"DEATH
BY AIRLOCK FAILURE."
MM-HMM.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.124
"DEATH BY BRAIN PARASITE."
YAH.

00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:46.230
"DEATH BY SONIC
DIARRHEA."

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.598
OH-HO, YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:49.935
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOUR PREVIOUS CAPTAINS

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.404
BUT I INTEND TO DO
AS LITTLE DYING AS POSSIBLE.

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:55.840
SIGN THE PAPER.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.543
AND NOW, FRY, BEFORE
YOU GO INTO SPACE

00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:01.129
YOU'LL NEED TO SEE
OUR STAFF DOCTOR.

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:04.899
I SHOULD WARN YOU, THOUGH,
HE'S A LITTLE... UNUSUAL.

00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:06.901
HE WEARS SANDALS.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.275
DR. ZOIDBERG, THIS IS FRY,
THE NEW DELIVERY BOY.

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:15.827
HE NEEDS A PHYSICAL.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:18.246
EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.933
YOU'LL BE FINE.

00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:25.180
NOW, OPEN YOUR MOUTH

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:27.255
AND LET'S HAVE A LOOK
AT THAT BRAIN.

00:03:27.324 --> 00:03:29.940
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NOT THAT MOUTH.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.276
I ONLY HAVE ONE.

00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:33.077
REALLY?

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.780
UH... IS THERE
A HUMAN DOCTOR AROUND?

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:38.499
YOUNG LADY, I'M AN
EXPERT ON HUMANS.

00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:40.846
PICK A MOUTH,
OPEN IT, AND SAY

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.941
WHAT?
MY MOTHER WAS A SAINT!

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.542
GET OUT.

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.253
DEAR LORD, BENDER,
YOU'RE FILTHY.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.188
YEAH, LIKE YOU DON'T
HAVE CRAP IN YOUR NECK.

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:02.935
AMY, WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE HIS BODY

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.937
A GOING-OVER WITH
THE CLEANING PICK?

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:06.094
OKAY.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.291
DOES IT HURT WHEN
I GO LIKE THIS?

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:09.514
OW!

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.898
A LITTLE.

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:13.551
WELL, THE DOCTOR SAYS
I'M AS HEALTHY AS A CRAB.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.964
CAN I GO INTO
SPACE NOW?

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.904
AS SOON AS WE FINISH
CLEANING BENDER.

00:04:16.973 --> 00:04:18.106

SHE'S AN ENGINEERING
STUDENT OF MINE.

00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:24.090
I LIKE HAVING
HER AROUND

00:04:24.114 --> 00:04:26.547
BECAUSE SHE HAS THE
SAME BLOOD TYPE AS ME.

00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:30.985
HEY, YOU'RE THE UNFROZEN GUY
FROM THE 20th CENTURY, RIGHT?

00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:32.770

JUST BE CAREFUL.

00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:38.118
I'D LIKE TO HOLD OFF
ANY MAJOR SCREW-UPS

00:05:38.188 --> 00:05:40.588
UNTIL AT LEAST
MY SECOND DAY AS CAPTAIN.

00:05:40.657 --> 00:05:42.668
NOTHING WILL
GO WRONG.

00:05:42.692 --> 00:05:43.969
IF SOMETHING
GOES WRONG

00:05:43.993 --> 00:05:46.393
BRING BACK
THE BLOOD.

00:05:53.003 --> 00:05:54.268
CAN I DO THE COUNTDOWN?

00:05:54.337 --> 00:05:55.436
HUH? OH, SURE.

00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:56.604
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

00:05:56.673 --> 00:05:58.272
TEN, NINE...

00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.907
OKAY, WE'RE HERE.

00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:02.160
SIX, FIVE, FOUR,
THREE, TWO, ONE. BLASTOFF.

00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:12.403
HURRY UP.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:13.888
I WANT TO SEE THE MOON.

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:15.718
RELAX, IT'S OPEN
TILL 9:00.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:18.927
THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP
FOR FRY...

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:22.230
AND ONE GIANT LINE
FOR ADMISSION.

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:24.632

00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:26.250
UM... CAN I HAVE CUTS?

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:30.254
NO.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:36.072
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BELIEVE THIS

00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:38.712
BUT THEY LANDED
AN AMUSEMENT PARK ON THE MOON.

00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:41.666
GUH! IT'S THE HAPPIEST PLACE
ORBITING EARTH.

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:43.701
LET'S GO ALREADY.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.119
FRY, WE HAVE A CRATE TO DELIVER.

00:06:45.187 --> 00:06:46.815
LET'S JUST DUMP IT

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.117
AND SAY WE
DELIVERED IT.

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.073
TOO MUCH WORK.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:50.174
LET'S BURN IT AND<i> SAY</i>

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.525

00:06:51.594 --> 00:06:54.495
OKAY, IF EVERYONE'S FINISHED
BEING STUPID...

00:06:54.564 --> 00:06:56.363
I HAD MORE, BUT YOU GO AHEAD.

00:06:56.432 --> 00:06:58.611
WE'LL DELIVER THAT CRATE
LIKE PROFESSIONALS

00:06:58.635 --> 00:06:59.875
AND THEN WE'LL GO HOME.

00:06:59.903 --> 00:07:02.036
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO THE MOON BEFORE.

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:03.649
OH, ALL RIGHT.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.357
WE'LL DELIVER THAT CRATE
LIKE PROFESSIONALS

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.809
AND THEN WE'LL GO
RIDE THE BUMPER CARS.

00:07:10.746 --> 00:07:13.781
AMY, WHY DON'T YOU HELP FRY
HOIST DOWN THE CRATE?

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:15.678
THEN LOCK UP

ADDRESS ALL COMPLAINTS
TO THE MONSANTO CORPORATION.

00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:52.856
WHAT'S WRONG, FRY?

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.058
I DON'T KNOW.

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.626
THIS PLACE
IS GREAT AND ALL

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:57.245
BUT IT'S JUST
SO ARTIFICIAL.

00:09:57.314 --> 00:09:59.580
THE GRAVITY, THE AIR,
THE GOPHERS.

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:01.883
YOU MIGHT AS WELL STAY ON EARTH.

00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:03.801
THAT'S WHAT I CAME TO SEE.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.322
I WANT TO GO OUT AND JUMP
AROUND LIKE AN ASTRONAUT.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.840
SCREW THIS PHONY STUFF.

00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:10.975
BUT THE PHONY STUFF
IS WHAT'S FUN.

00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:12.443
IT'S BORING OUT THERE.

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:15.413
YEAH. YOU'RE THE KIND OF GUY
WHO VISITS JERUSALEM

00:10:15.482 --> 00:10:17.748
AND DOESN'T WANT TO SEE
THE "SEXATERIA."

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:20.601
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE FRY
ON THE LUNAR ROVER RIDE.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.314
YOU GET TO WEAR
A SPACE SUIT

00:10:22.338 --> 00:10:24.183
AND DRIVE AROUND
ON THE SURFACE

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:25.417
AND THE LINE'S SHORT

00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:26.919
BECAUSE IT'S
EDUCATIONAL.

00:10:26.943 --> 00:10:28.409
I DON'T CARE
HOW EDUCATIONAL IT IS.

00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:29.760
LET'S DO IT!

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:33.648
NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM!

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:36.467
TWO ADULTS, PLEASE.

00:10:36.536 --> 00:10:39.086
FINALLY, GET READY FOR
SOME SERIOUS MOON ACTION.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.659
The story of lunar exploration

00:10:44.727 --> 00:10:46.544
started with one man...

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:48.179
A man with a dream.

00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:50.481
ONE OF THESE DAYS, ALICE...

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:55.003
BANG! ZOOM!
STRAIGHT TO THE MOON!

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:56.470
WOW.

00:10:56.539 --> 00:10:59.423
I NEVER REALIZED THE FIRST
ASTRONAUTS WERE SO FAT.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:00.841
THAT'S NOT AN ASTRONAUT.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.071
IT'S A TV COMEDIAN.

00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:03.806
HE WAS JUST USING
SPACE TRAVEL

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.150
AS A METAPHOR FOR
BEATING HIS WIFE.

00:11:11.621 --> 00:11:15.189
WOW! I COULD SWEAR I WAS
REALLY PLAYING VIRTUAL SKEEBALL.

00:11:15.275 --> 00:11:16.601
HMM?
LOOK, IT'S THAT CRATE

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:19.660
WE WERE GOING TO
THROW IN THE SEWER.

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:24.198
THE KEYS TO THE SHIP!

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.684
THEY MUST HAVE FALLEN
INTO THE CRATE.

00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:28.698
AW, LEELA'S GOING
TO KILL ME.

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:30.788
NAH. SHE'LL PROBABLY
MAKE ME DO IT.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:32.223
MISTER

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:34.692
COULD YOU PLEASE GET
THOSE KEYS OUT FOR ME?

00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:37.144
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE,
A GUY WHO'S NOT LAZY?

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:53.460
No one knows where, when or how
man first landed on the Moon.

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:54.795
I DO.

00:11:54.864 --> 00:11:56.630
But our Fungineers think

00:11:56.699 --> 00:11:59.667
it might have happened
something like this.

00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:02.303

00:12:12.132 --> 00:12:14.064
I DON'T SEE YOU WITH
A FUNGINEERING DEGREE.

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:15.311
THIS IS STUPID.

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:17.868
I'M TAKING THIS THING
OUT TO THE REAL MOON.

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:19.003
FRY, NO.

00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.271
THIS IS MY FIRST MISSION

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.440
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET US
GET IN ANY TROUBLE.

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:23.874

OKAY, YOU'RE

00:12:36.105 --> 00:12:37.471
NOW, I'LL GIVE YOU
TEN MINUTES.

00:12:37.539 --> 00:12:39.106
THEN YOU'LL GET BORED,
TURN AROUND

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.808
AND APOLOGIZE
FOR BEING SUCH A JERK.

00:12:40.877 --> 00:12:43.477
AGREED?
AGREED.

00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:44.546

MAKE A U-TURN
AT THE NEXT CRATER.

00:12:59.662 --> 00:13:01.028
NO, NOT YET.

00:13:01.097 --> 00:13:03.709
HOW ABOUT WE GO LOOK
FOR THE ORIGINAL
MOON LANDING SITE?

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:06.000
THAT'S CRAZY.
IT'S BEEN LOST
FOR CENTURIES.

00:13:06.068 --> 00:13:07.246
WELL, I'M FEELING LUCKY.

00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:11.555
OOH! OW! OOH!

YOU DID IT.

00:13:35.598 --> 00:13:37.548
WE'RE SAFE.

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:39.516

HEY, LOOK WHAT I WON
FROM A TOURIST'S POCKET.

00:13:49.345 --> 00:13:50.628
SHUT UP.

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:52.129
YOU'RE DISTRACTING ME.

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:54.532
COME ON, IT'S JUST
LIKE MAKING LOVE.

00:13:54.601 --> 00:13:57.134
YOU KNOW, LEFT, DOWN,
ROTATE 62 DEGREES

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:58.870
ENGAGE ROTOR.

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:01.138

HERE, LET ME DO IT.

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:12.166
LOUSY ARM
MUST BE RIGGED.

00:14:13.402 --> 00:14:14.735
THAT'S HER,
OFFICERS.

00:14:14.803 --> 00:14:15.903
THAT'S THE WOMAN

00:14:15.972 --> 00:14:17.788
WHO PROGRAMMED ME
FOR EVIL.

00:14:23.413 --> 00:14:27.999
YEAH, WELL, I'M GOING TO GO
BUILD MY OWN THEME PARK

00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:30.434
WITH BLACKJACK AND HOOKERS.

00:14:30.503 --> 00:14:32.804
IN FACT, FORGET THE PARK.

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:38.910
I'M SORRY, LEELA.

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:40.456
I CAN'T GO ON
ANY FURTHER.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.047
JUST LEAVE ME TO DIE
IN THAT BARN OVER THERE.

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:51.005
OH, THANK GOD.

00:14:53.576 --> 00:14:55.209
TRESPASSERS, EH?

00:14:55.278 --> 00:14:57.662
NO, SIR. WE'RE
AMUSEMENT PARK PATRONS.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.614
OH, THAT'S A WICKED,
SINFUL PLACE.

00:15:00.683 --> 00:15:01.866
TILT-A-WHIRL'S OKAY

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:03.835
BUT THE REST IS MIGHTY WICKED.

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.387
OUR CAR BROKE DOWN
AND WE'RE OUT OF OXYGEN.

00:15:06.455 --> 00:15:07.721
CAN WE BORROW SOME?

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.390
"BORRY?"

00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:11.908
LOOKY HERE, CITY GIRL,
OXYGEN DON'T GROW ON TREES.

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:13.937
YOU'LL HAVE TO EARN IT
DOING CHORES

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:15.345
ON MY HYDROPONIC FARM.

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:18.432
YOU CAN GO BACK TO YOUR PRECIOUS
THEME PARK AT SUNUP.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:21.068
I GUESS WE COULD DO
CHORES FOR A FEW HOURS.

00:15:21.137 --> 00:15:23.521
FRY, NIGHT LASTS
TWO WEEKS ON THE MOON.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:26.873
YEP. DROPS DOWN TO MINUS 173.

00:15:26.942 --> 00:15:28.875
FAHRENHEIT OR CELSIUS?

00:15:28.944 --> 00:15:30.422
FIRST ONE,
THAN THE OTHER.

00:15:30.446 --> 00:15:32.391
AND THEM SPACE SUITS
AIN'T' A-HEATED

00:15:32.415 --> 00:15:34.781
SO YOU AIN'T GOING
NOWHERE TILL SUNRISE.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.350
YOU CAN SLEEP IN THE BARN.

00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:38.286
JUST DON'T BE A-TOUCHIN'

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:41.922
MY THREE BEAUTIFUL ROBOT
DAUGHTERS, YOU HEAR?

00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:43.674
ROBOT DAUGHTERS?

00:15:43.743 --> 00:15:45.876
THIS HERE'S
LULABELLE 7...

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.310
YOO-HOO.

YOO-HOO.

00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:52.583
AND THE
CRUSHINATOR.

00:15:54.187 --> 00:15:56.097
YOO-HOO.

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.654
WHOO!

00:15:57.723 --> 00:16:00.925
I TOLD YOU TO TURN AROUND
AND GO BACK TO THE PARK.

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:03.227
BUT OH, NO.
THE PARK WAS TOO PHONY.

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:05.112
WE HAD TO SEE THE REAL MOON.

00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:06.830
AND IT WAS GREAT.

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:08.332
WE GOT TO SEE CRATERS AND ROCKS

00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:10.767
AND THAT ONE INCREDIBLE ROCK
THAT LOOKED LIKE A CRATER

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:12.002
AND... AND... THESE FELLAS.

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:16.473
FRY, FACE IT:
THE MOON IS A DUMP.

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:18.359
IT'S A BORING
DRIED-UP WASTELAND.

00:16:18.428 --> 00:16:20.828
AND THE ONLY REASON
ANYBODY EVER COMES HERE

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.097
IS FOR THE TACKY
LITTLE AMUSEMENT PARK.

00:16:23.166 --> 00:16:24.682
CAN'T YOU JUST
ACCEPT THAT?

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.851
I GUESS I CAN'T.

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:31.539
I'LL LEARN YOU TO SLEEP
WITH MY ROBOT DAUGHTERS.

00:16:33.142 --> 00:16:35.993
HE'LL NEVER FIND ME IN HERE.

00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:37.062
BENDER?

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.895
UH, BENDER, YOU DIDN'T TOUCH

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.580
THE CRUSHINATOR, DID YOU?

00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:41.982
OF COURSE NOT.

00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:44.819
A LADY THAT FINE
YOU GOT TO ROMANCE FIRST.

00:16:56.832 --> 00:16:58.165
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

00:16:58.234 --> 00:17:00.067
COME HERE, CRUSHINATOR.

00:17:00.136 --> 00:17:01.902
YES, PA.

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:20.587
IT'S TOO LOW.
HANG ON.

00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:22.776
HANG ON.
JUMP.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.962
HOLD ON TO YOUR HELMET.

00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:32.984
WHOA!

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.505
OH, BOY.
YES!

00:17:42.345 --> 00:17:45.662
GOLDURN IT,
CRUSHINATOR, JUMP!

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.282
I LOVE HIM.

00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:53.237
OH!

00:17:53.306 --> 00:17:54.366
HEY, COOL.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.757
DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.

00:17:56.825 --> 00:17:59.410
NIGHTFALL'S COMING.

00:18:01.397 --> 00:18:02.496
HURRY,
BEFORE WE FREEZE.

00:18:02.565 --> 00:18:04.882
WHAT DO YOU MEAN<i> WE,</i> MAMMAL?

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:13.540
OH, DEAR.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.554
I REALLY OUGHT TO
DO SOMETHING.

00:18:15.578 --> 00:18:19.113
BUT I AM ALREADY
IN MY PAJAMAS.

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:25.781
WE CAN'T OUTRUN
IT FOREVER.

00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:27.504
OVER THERE.

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:28.489
LOOK!

00:18:28.557 --> 00:18:30.685
IT'S THE MOON
LANDING SITE.

00:18:30.709 --> 00:18:32.426
WE FOUND IT.

00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:39.533
QUICK, GET IN.

00:18:39.602 --> 00:18:41.986
IT'S THAT FLAG FROM MTV

00:18:42.055 --> 00:18:45.272
AND NEIL ARMSTRONG'S FOOTPRINT.

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:48.292
HEY, MY FOOT'S BIGGER.

00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:51.529
LEELA, ISN'T THIS THE GREATEST
THING YOU'VE EVER SEEN?

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:53.297
FRY, LOOK AROUND.

00:18:53.366 --> 00:18:55.166
IT'S JUST A CRUMMY
PLASTIC FLAG

00:18:55.235 --> 00:18:57.418
AND A DEAD MAN'S
TRACKS IN THE DUST.

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:04.408
NOW, GET IN HERE
BEFORE YOU FREEZE.

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:15.052
OH, NO ROOM
FOR BENDER, HUH?

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.188
FINE, I'LL GO BUILD
MY OWN LUNAR LANDER

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:20.468
WITH BLACKJACK
AND HOOKERS.

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:24.728
IN FACT, FORGET THE LUNAR
LANDER AND THE BLACKJACK.

00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:26.863
AH, SCREW THE WHOLE THING.

00:19:26.932 --> 00:19:28.532
WELL, IF THE OXYGEN
HOLDS OUT

00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:31.052
WE MIGHT LIVE LONG ENOUGH
TO STARVE TO DEATH.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.503
LOOK, LEELA, I'M SORRY.

00:19:32.572 --> 00:19:34.921
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
DRAGGED YOU OUT HERE.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.990
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:36.025 --> 00:19:37.191
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.577
I STILL DON'T GET
WHAT THE BIG ATTRACTION IS.

00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:41.412
OH... I NEVER TOLD ANYBODY THIS

00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:44.582
BUT A THOUSAND YEARS AGO,
I USED TO LOOK UP AT THE MOON

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.584
AND DREAM ABOUT
BEING AN ASTRONAUT.

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:49.820
I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE GRADES
OR THE PHYSICAL ENDURANCE.

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:51.122
PLUS, I THREW UP A LOT

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.491
AND NOBODY LIKES
SPENDING A WEEK WITH ME.

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.326
A WEEK WOULD BE A LITTLE MUCH.

00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:58.579
THE MOON WAS LIKE THIS AWESOME,
ROMANTIC, MYSTERIOUS THING

00:19:58.647 --> 00:20:01.849
HANGING UP THERE IN THE SKY
WHERE YOU COULD NEVER REACH IT

00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:03.797
NO MATTER
HOW MUCH YOU WANTED TO.

00:20:05.421 --> 00:20:06.837
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:20:06.906 --> 00:20:09.873
ONCE YOU'RE ACTUALLY HERE,
IT'S JUST A BIG DULL ROCK.

00:20:09.943 --> 00:20:13.010
I GUESS I JUST WANTED YOU
TO SEE IT THROUGH MY EYES

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:14.211
THE WAY I USED TO.

00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:20.500
FRY, LOOK.

00:20:20.569 --> 00:20:22.636
IT REALLY<i> IS</i>
BEAUTIFUL.

00:20:22.705 --> 00:20:26.440
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I NEVER NOTICED BEFORE.

00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:39.136
HAD TO COME BACK FOR THE
CRUSHINATOR, EH, ROBOT?

00:20:39.205 --> 00:20:41.104
WELL, I GOT YOU THIS TIME.

00:20:50.316 --> 00:20:51.248
IT'S AMY.

00:20:51.317 --> 00:20:52.616
WE'RE SAVED.

00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:54.051
AMY?

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.487
WHERE'D SHE LEARN TO OPERATE
THE CONTROLS LIKE THAT?

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:06.981
NOT THE MAGNET.

00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:09.549
NO! NO! NO!

00:21:09.618 --> 00:21:10.634
