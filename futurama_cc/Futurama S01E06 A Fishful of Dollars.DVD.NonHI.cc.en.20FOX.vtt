WEBVTT

00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:12.093
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:15.297
THEY'VE BEEN AT IT FOR HOURS!

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.065
GIVE IT A REST, YOU TWO!

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:24.522
SORRY!

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.708
GOOD MORNING,
CLASS.

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:04.111
I TRUST YOU'VE ALL PREPARED
FOR TODAY'S FINAL EXAM.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.207
UH, EXCUSE ME.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.743
I MISSED
A FEW LECTURES.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.394
UH, WHAT SUBJECT
IS THIS?

00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:11.169
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN ALGEBRA.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.921
WHAT A NIGHTMARE!

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.958
MR. FRY,
ARE THOSE YOUR UNDERPANTS?

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.114
YOUNG MAN, I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU LEARNED A LESSON

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.100
ABOUT LIGHTSPEED BRAND BRIEFS.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.953
<i>LIGHTSPEED FITS
TODAY'S ACTIVE LIFESTYLE</i>

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:30.788
<i>WHETHER YOU'RE ON THE JOB</i>

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.575
<i>OR HAVING FUN.</i>

00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:35.043
<i>LIGHTSPEED BRIEFS...</i>

00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:37.796
<i>STYLE AND COMFORT
FOR THE DISCRIMINATING CROTCH.</i>

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:38.630
OH!

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:40.231
WHAT A WEIRD DREAM.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.733
I'LL NEVER GET BACK TO SLEEP.

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:52.744
SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME
THEY BROADCAST COMMERCIALS
INTO PEOPLE'S DREAMS?

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:53.762
OF COURSE.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.263
BUT HOW IS
THAT POSSIBLE?

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.597
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.494
THE AD GETS
INTO YOUR BRAIN

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.286
JUST LIKE THIS LIQUID
GETS INTO THIS EGG.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:03.954
ALTHOUGH IN REALITY

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:06.591
IT'S NOT LIQUID,
BUT GAMMA RADIATION.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.675
THAT'S AWFUL.

00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:09.043
IT'S LIKE BRAINWASHING.

00:02:09.112 --> 00:02:11.324
DIDN'T YOU HAVE ADS
IN THE 20th CENTURY?

00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:13.631
WELL, SURE,
BUT NOT IN OUR DREAMS...

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.550
ONLY ON TV AND RADIO...

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.084
AND IN MAGAZINES...

00:02:17.154 --> 00:02:18.253
AND MOVIES...

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:19.587
AND AT BALL GAMES...

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:20.888
AND ON BUSES

00:02:20.957 --> 00:02:23.274
AND MILK CARTONS AND T-SHIRTS
AND BANANAS

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.775
AND WRITTEN ON THE SKY

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:26.277
BUT NOT IN DREAMS.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.346
NO, SIRREE.

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:28.774
QUIT SQUAWKING,
FLESHWAD.

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:30.877
NOBODY'S FORCING YOU
TO BUY ANYTHING.

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.618
YEAH. I MEAN,
WE ALL HAD COMMERCIALS
IN OUR DREAMS

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:36.237
BUT YOU DON'T SEE US
RUNNING OFF TO BUY
BRAND-NAME MERCHANDISE

00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:38.406
AT LOW, LOW PRICES.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.456
HI. CARE TO SAMPLE
THE LATEST FRAGRANCE

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:56.991
FROM CALVIN CLONE?

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.359
NO, THANKS.

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:00.928
AND YOU, SIR?

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:02.113
NO, THANKS. I...

00:03:07.504 --> 00:03:09.971
WHAT A LOVELY FACE.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.018
WE JUST NEED TO
DRAW ATTENTION

00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:13.908
<i>AWAY</i> FROM THE EYE AREA.

00:03:21.852 --> 00:03:23.051
COOL.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:27.082
CAN I TRY THESE ON
BEFORE I BUY THEM?

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:30.058
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T LET
YOU OPEN THE PACKAGE

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:32.660
BUT YOU CAN TRY ON
THE DEMO PAIR.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.682
OOH.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.683
HO-HO-HO.

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.105
HEY, BENDER.
GREAT NEW SWEATER.

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.894
UH, "NEW"?
WHAT SWEATER?

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.408
I CAME IN WITH IT!

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.177
I DON'T KNOW YOU PEOPLE.

00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:12.416
$30, PLEASE.

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:14.986
$30? I CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.621
UNLESS...

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.889
DO YOU TAKE VISA?

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.108
VISA HASN'T EXISTED
FOR 500 YEARS.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.275
AMERICAN EXPRESS?

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:22.410
600 YEARS.

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.695
DISCOVER CARD?

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.391
MMM, SORRY,
WE DON'T TAKE DISCOVER.

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:26.475
HEY...

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.143
HE'S SPRINGING
FOR LIGHTSPEEDS?

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.035
- PRETTY RITZY.
- NO, I CAN'T AFFORD THEM.

00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:32.403
BEING POOR SUCKS.

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.771
WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS THIS

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.107
WHERE THEY ADVERTISE THINGS
NOT EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD?

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:38.656
QUIET. THERE'S
AN AD COMING ON.

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:40.345
Hello, shoppers.

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.846
It's me, Mom.

00:04:41.915 --> 00:04:43.581
HEY, WHO'S
THE ROCKER JOCKEY?

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:45.516
GUH! IT'S MOM...

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.379
THE WORLD'S MOST HUGGABLE
INDUSTRIALIST.

00:04:47.403 --> 00:04:49.170
Call me old-fashioned

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:51.489
but when my robot
starts to squeak

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:55.360
like an old screen door, well,
that's when I reach for a can

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.411
of Mom's Old-Fashioned
Robot Oil.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.813
OOH, TASTY.

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:02.784
And remember: Mom's Oil is made
with 10% more love

00:05:02.852 --> 00:05:04.335
than the next leading brand.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:06.671
"Mom," "love" and "screen door"

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.700
are registered trademarks
of MomCorp.

00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:11.942
HEY, BENDER,
SOUNDS LIKE YOU

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:13.578
COULD USE A LITTLE
OF THAT OIL.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.199
HAMBONED.

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:19.333
FREEZE, SCUZZBOT!

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.885
UH, THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:23.320
SOME SORT OF A MISTAKE HERE.

00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:27.174
I'M SURE THERE'S...

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:29.827
I SAY, I'M SURE THERE'S...

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:34.965
THAT IS, I'M SURE THERE'S...

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:36.667
A VERY...

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:38.135
REASONABLE...

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.129
<i>DO WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO PAY BENDER'S FINE?</i>

00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:51.366
78... 79... 79.50.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.901
CRUD. WE'RE 50 CENTS SHORT.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.737
I'D LOVE TO CHIP IN,
BUT BENDER STOLE MY WALLET.

00:05:58.091 --> 00:05:59.674
HEY, THAT'S MY OLD BANK.

00:05:59.743 --> 00:06:01.726
MAYBE MY ACCOUNT'S STILL OPEN.

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:09.167
HMM. WE DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE YOUR RETINA SCAN

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:12.170
YOUR FINGERPRINT<i> OR</i> YOUR
COLONIC MAP ON FILE.

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:14.054
YEAH, WELL, I DID OPEN
THE ACCOUNT

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:15.556
OVER A THOUSAND YEARS AGO.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:16.740
WHAT ABOUT MY A.T.M. CARD?

00:06:18.094 --> 00:06:19.955
DO YOU STILL REMEMBER
YOUR PIN NUMBER?

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.224
SURE. IT'S THE PRICE OF
A CHEESE PIZZA AND A LARGE SODA

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:23.714
BACK WHERE
I USED TO WORK...

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:24.899
PINUCCI'S PIZZA.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:29.103
OKAY. YOU HAD A BALANCE
OF 93 CENTS.

00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:30.204
ALL RIGHT.

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:32.723
AT AN AVERAGE OF 2 1/4
PERCENT INTEREST

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:34.358
OVER A PERIOD OF 1,000 YEARS

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:35.926
THAT COMES TO...

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:37.411
$4.3 BILLION.

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:48.689
TO FRY.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.016
I KNOW FRY'S RICH

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.413
BUT DO WE REALLY HAVE
TO WEAR THESE TOP HATS?

00:07:00.437 --> 00:07:03.621
MAYBE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
JUST HOW RICH HE IS.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.674
IN FACT, I THINK
I BETTER PUT ON A MONOCLE.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:35.070
<i>PIZZA DINNER ON ME.</i>

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.540
JUST KEEP THE TAB
UNDER $50 MILLION.

00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:42.010
YO.
I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:43.511
WHAT KIND OF PIZZA
YOUS GUYS WANT?

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.765
UH, YEAH, WE'LL HAVE, UH, ONE
WITH EVERYTHING BUT ANCHOVIES

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.400
AND, UH, ONE WITH
MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE TOPPING...

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.769
ANCHOVIES.

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:52.331
INVALID SELECTION.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.383
YO, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:55.574
ANCHOVIES. YOU KNOW...

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:56.958
THOSE LITTLE HEADLESS FISH?

00:07:57.027 --> 00:07:58.343
DOES NOT COMPUTE.

00:07:58.412 --> 00:07:59.944
DOES NOT COMPUTE.

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:04.594
I'M SORRY, FRY,
BUT THE ANCHOVY

00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:06.946
HAS BEEN EXTINCT
SINCE THE 2200s.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.355
- WHAT?
- OH, MY, YES,
FISHED TO DEATH...

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:12.535
JUST ABOUT THE TIME
YOUR PEOPLE ARRIVED ON EARTH

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:14.075
WASN'T IT, ZOIDBERG?

00:08:14.144 --> 00:08:15.777
I'M NOT ON TRIAL HERE.

00:08:15.846 --> 00:08:17.924
SO NONE OF YOU HAS
EVER HAD ANCHOVIES?

00:08:17.948 --> 00:08:20.381
OH, MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.001
THEY'RE ALL SALTY AND OILY,
AND THEY MELTED IN YOUR MOUTH...

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.453
STOP! STOP!
I ADMIT IT.

00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:27.255
MY PEOPLE ATE THEM ALL.

00:08:27.324 --> 00:08:29.285
WE KEPT SAYING,
"ONE MORE CAN'T HURT."

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:30.942
AND THEN THEY WERE GONE.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.860
WE'RE SORRY!

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.692
I JUST WISH I COULD
HAVE SHOWED YOU GUYS

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:37.348
HOW GREAT THEY WERE.

00:08:37.418 --> 00:08:39.295
I MAY BE RICH, BUT I
STILL CAN'T BUY BACK

00:08:39.319 --> 00:08:41.364
ALL THE THINGS I MISS
FROM THE 20th CENTURY.

00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:44.305
MAYBE YOU'RE FORGETTING
JUST HOW RICH YOU ARE.

00:08:44.374 --> 00:08:46.774
HUH? HUH?

00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:56.585
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:08:56.653 --> 00:08:59.738
I KNOW YOU SPENT A LOT OF MONEY
ON THIS PLACE, FRY

00:08:59.806 --> 00:09:01.490
BUT IT'S AWFULLY PRIMITIVE.

00:09:01.558 --> 00:09:03.892
THE FLOORS ARE MADE
OF SUCH HARD WOOD.

00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.189
HEY, GET A LOAD
OF THIS PATHETIC
20th-CENTURY TV.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:09.130
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH IT?

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:11.227
WELL, ASIDE FROM
CAUSING EYE CANCER

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:14.752
THESE THINGS HAD A LOUSY,
LOW-DEFINITION PICTURE.

00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:15.970
THAT'S TRUE.

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:17.850
ON A TV LIKE THIS,
I BET YOU COULDN'T EVEN

00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:19.157
MAKE OUT MY OBSCENE TATTOO.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.626
THAT'S CUTE.

00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:26.030
SOLD!

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:27.014
YES!

00:09:27.084 --> 00:09:28.366
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:29.918
WHO WAS THIS TED DANSON

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:33.087
AND WHY WOULD YOU PAY
$10,000 FOR HIS SKELETON?

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.967
I HAVE AN IDEA
FOR A SITCOM.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.507
AH, LEAVE HIM
ALONE, LEELA.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.110
SO HE'S GOING A LITTLE WACKO
WITH HIS MONEY.

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:40.378
THAT'S OKAY.

00:09:40.447 --> 00:09:41.624
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:43.726
'CAUSE HE BOUGHT YOU
THAT ANTIQUE ROBOT TOY.

00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:46.352
YEAH.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:48.136
IT IS CUTE.

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:51.255
NOW, OUR FINAL ITEM:

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:52.824
THIS UNOPENED CAN

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:57.529
OF ANGRY NORWEGIAN BRAND
ANCHOVIES, CIRCA 1997.

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.063
ANCHOVIES?

00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:01.249
THE LAST KNOWN CAN

00:10:01.318 --> 00:10:03.284
GUARANTEED FRESH
AND EDIBLE.

00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:05.186
DO I HEAR $10,000?

00:10:05.255 --> 00:10:06.687
$15,000.

00:10:06.756 --> 00:10:08.139
20.

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:10.058
30. NO, 40.

00:10:10.127 --> 00:10:12.827
$50,000.

00:10:12.896 --> 00:10:14.078
ARE YOU CRAZY?

00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:16.180
IT'S A CAN OF OLD FISH.

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:18.394
DON'T TELL ME HOW
TO SPEND MY MONEY.

00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:20.685
50, GOING ONCE, TWICE...

00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:22.369
$75,000.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.736
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S MOM.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.921
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER
IN PERSON BEFORE.

00:10:28.945 --> 00:10:30.895
$100,000.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.011
FRY, YOU CAN'T
BID AGAINST MOM.

00:10:35.035 --> 00:10:36.145
SHE'S THE RICHEST

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:38.081
MOST POWERFUL
PERSON IN THE WORLD.

00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:39.715
AND SHE'S
SO ADORABLE.

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:44.642
WELL, I SUPPOSE I COULD GO
AS HIGH AS... $300,000.

00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:47.395
- 500.
- MERCY ME... A MILLION.

00:10:47.464 --> 00:10:49.208
- TWO.
- SIX.
- FOURTEEN.

00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.943
I CAN SEE THE
NICE YOUNG MAN

00:10:50.967 --> 00:10:52.878
REALLY WANTS
THOSE LITTLE FISH.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.319
NEVERTHELESS,
I'LL BID 23 MILLION.

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:57.505
ONE JILLION DOLLARS.

00:10:58.775 --> 00:11:00.992
SIR, THAT'S NOT A NUMBER.

00:11:02.312 --> 00:11:04.078
OH. IN THAT CASE...

00:11:04.147 --> 00:11:05.246
50 MILLION.

00:11:06.783 --> 00:11:08.133
WELL, BOYS,

00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:11.435
YOUR OLD MOTHER KNOWS
WHEN SHE'S BEEN BEAT.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:12.904
YOU WIN, YOUNG MAN.

00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:14.572
I TIP MY BONNET TO YOU.

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:17.258
OH, ISN'T SHE ADORABLE?

00:11:17.327 --> 00:11:19.493
WHAT A CLASS ACT. SOLD!

00:11:19.562 --> 00:11:21.573
TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO
BOUGHT EVERY ITEM

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:23.097
IN TODAY'S AUCTION.

00:11:29.038 --> 00:11:34.642
NOW FOR SOME GOOD OLD
20th-CENTURY TV.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.744
AH.

00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:39.146
Do you remember a time

00:11:39.215 --> 00:11:41.866
when chocolate chip cookies
came fresh from the oven?

00:11:41.918 --> 00:11:43.117
Petridge Farm remembers.

00:11:43.186 --> 00:11:44.435
OH, THOSE WERE THE DAYS.

00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:46.987
Do you remember a time
when women couldn't vote

00:11:47.056 --> 00:11:49.808
and certain folk weren't allowed
on golf courses?

00:11:49.876 --> 00:11:51.426
Petridge Farm remembers.

00:11:52.528 --> 00:11:54.545
FRY, ARE YOU THERE?

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:55.730
HUH?

00:11:57.284 --> 00:11:59.262
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO
WORK IN THREE DAYS.

00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:00.584
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:01.987
I'VE BEEN SITTING RIGHT HERE.

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:04.133
I PICKED UP MY LIFE
EXACTLY WHERE I LEFT OFF

00:12:04.157 --> 00:12:05.456
A THOUSAND YEARS AGO.

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:07.592
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME?

00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:10.361
IT'S 8:00, TIME TO GET BUSY.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.546
♪ I like big butts
and I cannot lie ♪

00:12:12.615 --> 00:12:14.899
♪ You other brothers
can't deny ♪

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:16.984
YOU CAN'T JUST
SIT HERE IN THE DARK

00:12:17.053 --> 00:12:18.803
LISTENING TO CLASSICAL MUSIC.

00:12:18.872 --> 00:12:21.105
I COULD IF YOU HADN'T
TURNED ON THE LIGHTS

00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:22.440
AND SHUT OFF THE STEREO.

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:25.143
FRY, THIS ISN'T HEALTHY;
YOU'RE LIVING IN THE PAST.

00:12:25.212 --> 00:12:27.245
I'M RICH. I CAN LIVE
WHENEVER I WANT.

00:12:27.314 --> 00:12:28.579
BUT WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS

00:12:28.648 --> 00:12:30.581
AND WE LIVE<i> HERE</i>
IN THE YEAR 3000.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.949
YEAH.

00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:35.085
NOW, ARE YOU GOING TO COME
TO THE SQUID FIGHTS WITH US

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:37.722
OR SIT HERE WALLOWING
IN YOUR PREHISTORIC JUNK?

00:12:37.791 --> 00:12:38.906
JUNK?

00:12:38.975 --> 00:12:40.841
MAYBE YOU CAN'T
UNDERSTAND THIS

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.578
BUT I FINALLY FOUND
WHAT I NEED TO BE HAPPY

00:12:43.647 --> 00:12:45.813
AND IT'S NOT FRIENDS...
IT'S THINGS.

00:12:45.882 --> 00:12:47.059
I'M A THING.

00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:49.484
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.354
FRY, PLEASE.

00:12:53.422 --> 00:12:55.940
MY PONYTAIL'S CAUGHT
IN THE DOOR.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:57.408
I DON'T NEED THEM...

00:12:57.477 --> 00:12:59.944
NOT WHEN I HAVE
MY ANTIQUE VIDEOS

00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:02.063
MY BUCKET OF FOSSILIZED KFC

00:13:02.132 --> 00:13:04.749
AND $50 MILLION WORTH
OF ANCHOVIES.

00:13:08.188 --> 00:13:10.454
MERCY ME, WHAT A DAY.

00:13:10.523 --> 00:13:13.925
COULD YOU SHUT THE DOOR,
IGNER, DEAR?

00:13:13.994 --> 00:13:17.061
I THINK I FEEL A DRAFT
COMING ON.

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:21.366
HOLY CRAP,
THAT BASTARD'S ITCHY.

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:23.184
WALT, CREAM SODA.

00:13:23.253 --> 00:13:24.446
RIGHT AWAY, MOTHER.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.838
LARRY, GET YOUR
MOTHER A CREAM SODA.

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:28.606
BUT MOM SAID...

00:13:28.674 --> 00:13:30.291
YOU HEARD ME.

00:13:38.168 --> 00:13:39.267
WHAT'S WRONG, MOMMY?

00:13:39.336 --> 00:13:41.402
IT'S THOSE DAMNED ANCHOVIES.

00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:44.104
THAT DIRTBAG FRY
MUST KNOW THEIR SECRET

00:13:44.173 --> 00:13:47.325
AND I WON'T REST
UNTIL I GET MY HANDS ON THEM.

00:13:47.394 --> 00:13:50.461
NO ONE MESSES WITH MOM.

00:13:59.789 --> 00:14:01.839
QUIET, YOU.

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:10.147
AS YOU BOYS KNOW, ONE OF
THE CORNERSTONES OF MY EMPIRE

00:14:10.216 --> 00:14:12.136
IS MOM'S OLD-FASHIONED
ROBOT OIL.

00:14:12.202 --> 00:14:14.669
THINK OF IT...
TEN BILLION ROBOTS

00:14:14.737 --> 00:14:18.673
EACH ONE NEEDING AN OIL CHANGE
EVERY 3,000 MILES.

00:14:18.741 --> 00:14:20.741
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE MATH

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.060
TO KNOW THAT'S
A BUTTLOAD OF OIL.

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:24.495
CAN I WEAR YOUR FAT SUIT?

00:14:24.564 --> 00:14:25.812
NO, IGNER, PUT THAT DOWN!

00:14:25.881 --> 00:14:27.148
OHH.

00:14:27.217 --> 00:14:29.417
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH THE ANCHOVIES?

00:14:29.485 --> 00:14:33.070
I'M GETTING
TO THE FREAKING ANCHOVIES.

00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:37.141
A SINGLE DROP
OF THE ANCHOVY'S NATURAL OIL

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.360
WOULD LUBRICATE TEN ROBOTS
PERMANENTLY.

00:14:39.429 --> 00:14:41.040
WOW. IT'S A SHAME
THEY WENT EXTINCT.

00:14:41.064 --> 00:14:43.864
NO, IT ISN'T!
SHUT YOUR FILTHY CLAM!

00:14:43.933 --> 00:14:45.750
THANK YOU, WALT.

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:48.669
IF ANYONE EVER GOT HOLD
OF ANCHOVY DNA

00:14:48.738 --> 00:14:50.771
THEY COULD CHOP OUT
THE OIL-MAKING GENE

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.457
STICK IT IN A BUNCH
OF THIRD WORLD KIDS AND BAM!

00:14:53.526 --> 00:14:55.342
CHEAP, EFFECTIVE ROBOT OIL...

00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:58.312
ENOUGH TO PUT DEAR OLD MOM
OUT OF BUSINESS.

00:14:58.381 --> 00:15:01.015
MY GOD, THIS MR. FRY

00:15:01.084 --> 00:15:04.085
MUST BE A MASTERMIND
OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:10.541
Esther, you ugly.

00:15:11.694 --> 00:15:13.193
WE HAVE ONLY ONE OPTION.

00:15:13.262 --> 00:15:15.062
WE'LL HAVE TO BANKRUPT MR. FRY

00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:17.998
SO HE'LL BE FORCED TO SELL
THE ANCHOVIES TO US.

00:15:18.067 --> 00:15:21.168
MOTHER, YOU ARE ONE
CLEVER OLD SCAG.

00:15:21.237 --> 00:15:22.603
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:25.122
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GET
FRY'S MONEY OUT OF THE BANK?

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.025
THAT PART WILL BE EASY,
THANKS TO THE NICE PEOPLE

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:30.745
AT MOM'S OLD-FASHIONED
VIDEO SURVEILLANCE UNIT.

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:33.909
Do you still remember
your pin number?

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.411
Sure. It's the price
of a cheese pizza
and a large soda

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:38.869
back where I used to
work... Pinucci's Pizza.

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:43.335
It's the price
of a cheese pizza
and a large soda.

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:45.576
YOU KNOW WHAT NEEDS
TO BE DONE.

00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:46.711
WHAT?

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.797
GET HIS PIN NUMBER,
YOU IDIOTS!

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:55.836
NOW I'M OFF TO SOME CHARITY B.S.
FOR KNOCKED-UP TEENAGE SLUTS.

00:15:58.007 --> 00:16:01.208
MR. FRY, IT'S THOSE THREE
PLUMBERS YOU CALLED FOR.

00:16:01.277 --> 00:16:03.639
WE'RE HERE TO TIGHTEN
YOUR DRAINS.

00:16:03.663 --> 00:16:05.613
OW!

00:16:07.283 --> 00:16:09.349
I DIDN'T ORDER ANY...

00:16:09.418 --> 00:16:11.658
QUICK! GIVE HIM
THE TRANQUILIZER.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.390
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:23.647
WAKE UP, MR. FRY.

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:25.482
WHERE AM I?

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:29.286
YOU'RE IN THE GOOD OLD YEAR 2000
WORKING HERE AT PINUCCI'S PIZZA.

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:31.321
YOU FELL ASLEEP ON THE JOB.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.925
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE ME,
BUT I THOUGHT I GOT FROZEN.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.493
WASN'T I IN THE FUTURE?

00:16:36.562 --> 00:16:40.114
NO, YOU ONLY "DREAMED"
YOU WERE IN THE YEAR 3000.

00:16:40.183 --> 00:16:41.448
SO I'M REALLY BACK?

00:16:41.517 --> 00:16:44.534
WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED, I GUESS.

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:45.603
WHO ARE YOU?

00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:46.938
I AM MR. PINUCCI.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:48.155
YOU ARE?

00:16:48.224 --> 00:16:50.474
DID-DID YOU GROW A MUSTACHE
SINCE LAST NIGHT?

00:16:50.543 --> 00:16:53.644
NO. NOW, GO WORK
THE CURRENCY REGISTER.

00:16:53.713 --> 00:16:56.347
I THINK I HEAR
A CUSTOMER COMING.

00:16:56.416 --> 00:16:59.149
I SAID, "I THINK I HEAR
A CUSTOMER COMING."

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.035
OH, HURRY UP, PLEASE.

00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:04.204
I WANT TO GET BACK
TO THE HEAD MUSEUM.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:05.751
DON'T WORRY,
MISS ANDERSON.

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:07.140
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.

00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:09.943
NOW, YOUR MOTIVATION IS,
YOU'RE BACK IN THE YEAR 2000

00:17:10.012 --> 00:17:11.923
AND YOUR HEAD'S
STILL ON YOUR BODY

00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:13.530
AND YOU WANT A CHEESE PIZZA.

00:17:16.853 --> 00:17:18.452
OKAY, BUT I'M ONLY DOING THIS

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.404
SO PEOPLE WILL TAKE MY HEAD
SERIOUSLY AS AN ACTRESS.

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:23.991
HEY, LOOK... ANCHOVIES.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.692
OF COURSE.

00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:27.261
THEY'RE NOT EXTINCT YET.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.096
AND IF YOU NEED
FURTHER PROOF

00:17:29.165 --> 00:17:31.698
THAT THIS IS REALLY
A THOUSAND YEARS AGO

00:17:31.767 --> 00:17:35.001
WELL, HERE'S CONTEMPORARY
ACTRESS PAMELA ANDERSON.

00:17:36.338 --> 00:17:37.805
OOH.

00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:40.240
HELLO, FRY.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.425
REMEMBER ME
FROM<i> BAYWATCH: THE MOVIE?</i>

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:43.577
UH...

00:17:43.646 --> 00:17:45.062
IT WAS THE FIRST MOVIE

00:17:45.131 --> 00:17:47.347
TO BE SHOT ENTIRELY
IN SLOW MOTION.

00:17:47.416 --> 00:17:49.000
IT HASN'T BEEN MADE YET.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:50.729
THEN HE DOESN'T KNOW
I WON THE OSCAR?

00:17:50.753 --> 00:17:52.569
NOPE.
CRAP!

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.750
WAIT. YOU'RE
PAMELA ANDERSON.

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:57.157
COOL. WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

00:17:57.226 --> 00:18:00.594
OH, I'LL HAVE A CHEESE PIZZA
AND A LARGE...

00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:02.279
UH... LINE?

00:18:02.348 --> 00:18:03.497
SODA.

00:18:03.566 --> 00:18:04.648
OH, RIGHT.

00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:07.434
CHEESE PIZZA AND A LARGE SODA.

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:09.520
UH, CHEESE AND A...

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:11.138
THAT WAS QUICK.

00:18:11.206 --> 00:18:13.273
SO, WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.976
10.77...

00:18:16.044 --> 00:18:17.428
SAME AS MY PIN NUMBER.

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:28.939
HEY, YOU DON'T
GET TO LAUGH.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.344
THANKS A BILLION.

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:38.315
MORE LIKE 4.3 BILLION.

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:39.717
OH!
OW!

00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:53.597
UH, I HAD A NIGHTMARE
I WAS IN THE YEAR 2000

00:18:53.666 --> 00:18:55.199
AND YOU GUYS NEVER EXISTED.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:58.102
I'M SO GLAD I'M AWAKE NOW
AND YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

00:18:58.171 --> 00:18:59.670
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
CARE ABOUT US?

00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:02.184
WE THOUGHT YOU
ONLY CARED ABOUT
CANS OF ANCHOVIES

00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:04.219
AND STUFFY OLD SONGS
ABOUT THE BUTTOCKS.

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:06.177
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.678
GOOD-BYE.

00:19:07.747 --> 00:19:10.081
WHEE!

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:13.583
<i>THIS DREAM BROUGHT TO YOU
BY LIGHTSPEED BRIEFS.</i>

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.719
BENDER, LEELA...

00:19:15.788 --> 00:19:17.154
DON'T LEAVE ME.

00:19:17.223 --> 00:19:18.706
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:19:18.774 --> 00:19:20.891
HEY, HEY, BUDDY,
WHAT YEAR IS THIS?

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:23.176
UH... 3000.

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:24.628
3000?

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.480
YES! I'M STILL IN THE FUTURE!

00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:28.165
LIFE IS WONDERFUL!

00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:30.501
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH MY STUFF?

00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:31.968
UH, CHECK BOUNCED.

00:19:32.037 --> 00:19:33.871
WE'RE TAKING IT ALL BACK.

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:39.526
- OH, NO, MY A.T.M. CARD...
- 1077.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.946
I'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT.

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.897
EXCEPT...

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:47.952
YOU'RE FRY'S RELATIVE.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.187
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HE GOT SO CRAZY?

00:19:50.256 --> 00:19:51.455
UH, WHAT?

00:19:51.523 --> 00:19:54.508
OH, THEY SAY MADNESS
RUNS IN OUR FAMILY.

00:19:54.576 --> 00:19:56.210
SOME EVEN CALL<i> ME</i> MAD.

00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:58.278
AND WHY?

00:19:58.347 --> 00:20:02.282
BECAUSE I DARED TO DREAM OF
MY OWN RACE OF ATOMIC MONSTERS...

00:20:02.351 --> 00:20:05.402
ATOMIC SUPERMEN WITH
OCTAGONAL-SHAPED BODIES

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.181
THAT SUCK BLOOD
OUT OF YOU...

00:20:07.205 --> 00:20:08.383
LEELA, BENDER!

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:09.689
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

00:20:09.758 --> 00:20:11.491
YOU DID?
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.859
I WAS ROBBED.

00:20:12.928 --> 00:20:14.961
THEY GOT EVERYTHING,
EXCEPT THESE.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.296
WHO DID?

00:20:16.365 --> 00:20:17.964
HELLO, FRY.

00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:19.466
IT'S MOM.

00:20:19.535 --> 00:20:22.403
I FELT TERRIBLE WHEN I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR MONEY TROUBLES

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:25.406
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD
HELP OUT A SWEET YOUNG MAN

00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:27.974
BY BUYING HIS ANCHOVIES.

00:20:28.043 --> 00:20:30.527
SORRY, BUT THE ANCHOVIES
AREN'T FOR SALE.

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:32.763
WHAT? LISTEN,
YOU LITTLE BASTARD

00:20:32.832 --> 00:20:34.781
I CONTROL
THE ROBOT OIL BUSINESS

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.617
AND I WON'T LET YOU RUIN ME.

00:20:36.686 --> 00:20:38.151
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.187
YOU MIGHT AS WELL PUT
THAT CHECKBOOK AWAY

00:20:40.256 --> 00:20:43.007
BECAUSE I'VE DISCOVERED
SOMETHING EVEN MORE IMPORTANT...

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:45.926
MY FRIENDS, AND THEY AREN'T
WORTH EVEN A PENNY TO ME.

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:49.646
THAT'S WHY THESE ANCHOVIES
ARE GOING ON A PIZZA...

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:52.983
SO I CAN SHARE THE FOOD I LOVE
WITH THE PEOPLE I LIKE.

00:20:53.052 --> 00:20:55.652
HOLY HELL! YOU'RE
GOING TO EAT THEM?

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:58.722
OH! WELL, JUST MAKE SURE
YOU EAT THEM ALL.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.624
YOU'RE A GROWING BOY.

00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:02.993
TOODLE-OO!

00:21:03.062 --> 00:21:04.106
DUMB ASS.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.962
WHAT A NICE LADY.

00:21:10.303 --> 00:21:13.019
OKAY, MY FRIENDS,
GET READY

00:21:13.088 --> 00:21:16.067
FOR THE MOST
DELICIOUS
EXTINCT ANIMAL

00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:17.574
YOU'VE EVER TASTED.

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:18.993
I DON'T KNOW.

00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:20.061
I'VE HAD COW.

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.264
GROSS!

00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:25.265
ICK!

00:21:25.334 --> 00:21:26.650
MM.

00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:29.131
EH, NO ONE LIKES
THEM AT FIRST

00:21:29.155 --> 00:21:31.121
BUT THEY'LL GROW ON YOU.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.507
THAT STENCH...

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:36.709
THAT HEAVENLY STENCH.

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:41.881
MORE.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.295
THERE AREN'T ANYMORE,
AND THERE NEVER WILL BE.

00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:45.603
MORE!

00:21:45.655 --> 00:21:47.004
MORE!

00:21:47.073 --> 00:21:49.489
MORE!

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:51.074
MORE!
