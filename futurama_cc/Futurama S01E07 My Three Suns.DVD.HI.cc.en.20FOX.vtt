00:09:38.845 --> 00:09:40.678
ABOUT BECOMING
A PRIME MINISTER.

00:09:40.747 --> 00:09:42.180
I GOT TO GO WITH BENDER.

OVER YOUR HEAD.

GEE, YOU THINK SO, CAPTAIN?

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:53.841
I'D BETTER CHECK
WITH MY PRIME MINISTER.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.743
STAY THE COURSE, PAL.

00:09:55.811 --> 00:09:58.696

HE MET HIS END WHEN HE
WAS DRUNK BY EMPEROR STRUG.

00:12:21.023 --> 00:12:23.252
AND BEFORE HE COULD
EVEN WIPE HIS MOUTH

00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:24.637

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:27.045
SO?
LOOK AT ALL THESE GUYS.

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:30.226
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THE AVERAGE LENGTH
OF THEIR REIGNS WAS?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.300

00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:34.168

UNLESS IT WAS REALLY HIGH
OR REALLY LOW.

EVERY EMPEROR ASCENDED TO POWER

00:12:40.076 --> 00:12:41.753
BY ASSASSINATING
THE PREVIOUS ONE.

00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:42.827
AND GUESS WHO'S NEXT?

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.750

WILL GET WHAT'S COMING TO HIM.

00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:52.164
YOU'RE IN TREMENDOUS
DANGER, YOU IDIOT!

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:55.500

WERE DRUNK AT THEIR
OWN CORONATION.

HEY, I PLAN ON HAVING
A FEW BREWSKIS MYSELF.

00:12:58.227 --> 00:12:59.860
NO, THEY WERE ASSASSINATED.

00:12:59.929 --> 00:13:02.996
IN FACT, THE LAW SAYS
YOU'LL BE KILLED ON THE SPOT

IF YOU FAIL TO RECITE
THE OATH FROM MEMORY.

00:13:05.768 --> 00:13:07.668

THROUGH THAT LATER.

00:13:07.737 --> 00:13:09.836

IF I STOPPED
TO THINK AHEAD

AND I WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE
IN THE YEAR 3000.

00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:20.031
IT'S JUST LIKE THE STORY

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.033
OF THE GRASSHOPPER
AND THE OCTOPUS.

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:25.620
ALL YEAR LONG, THE GRASSHOPPER
KEPT BURYING ACORNS FOR WINTER

00:13:25.688 --> 00:13:28.255
WHILE THE OCTOPUS MOOCHED
OFF HIS GIRLFRIEND

00:13:28.324 --> 00:13:29.557
AND WATCHED TV.

00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:30.958
BUT THEN
THE WINTER CAME

00:13:31.026 --> 00:13:32.443
AND THE GRASSHOPPER DIED

00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:34.479
AND THE OCTOPUS ATE
ALL HIS ACORNS

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:36.158
AND ALSO HE GOT
A RACE CAR.

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:38.449

THROUGH TO YOU?

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:39.550
