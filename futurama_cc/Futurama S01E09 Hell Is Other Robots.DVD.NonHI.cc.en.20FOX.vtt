00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:37.740
MAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

00:02:37.808 --> 00:02:39.942
YOU STILL WORKING AT
JACK IN THE BOX?

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.393
NOT ANYMORE, BABY.

00:02:41.462 --> 00:02:42.844
I'M WITH THE BAND.

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:47.032
OH-OH, YEAH.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.227
HEY, FELLAS

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.801
I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY FRIENDS

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.320
BENDER, FRY, AND LEELA.

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.289
YOU KNOW, WE'RE REALLY NOT THAT
INTERESTED IN MEETING THEM.

00:02:54.358 --> 00:02:55.819
WOW, I LOVE
YOU GUYS.

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:57.487
BACK IN THE 20th CENTURY

00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.539
I HAD ALL FIVE
OF YOUR ALBUMS.

00:02:59.563 --> 00:03:02.280
THAT WAS A THOUSAND YEARS AGO.
NOW WE GOT SEVEN.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.227
COOL. CAN I BORROW
THE NEW ONES?

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:05.900
AND A COUPLE OF BLANK TAPES?

00:03:07.338 --> 00:03:10.022
HEY, BENDER, WHY DON'T
WE DITCH THESE ORGAN SACKS

00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.489
AND HIT THE REAL PARTY?

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:14.758
COUNT ME IN.
I'M GOING TO DRINK
TILL I REBOOT.

00:03:21.202 --> 00:03:23.368
HEY, WHAT KIND
OF PARTY IS THIS?

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:25.770
THERE'S NO BOOZE
AND ONLY ONE HOOKER.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.472
DON'T BE A DRAG, MAN.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:28.701
WE'RE JACKING ON.

00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:33.528
O-O-O-H, Y-Y-YEAH!

00:03:35.032 --> 00:03:36.098
WANT A JOLT?

00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:37.432
UH, HEY, I'M NO SQUARE

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:39.434
BUT ISN'T THAT COUNTER-INDICATED

00:03:39.503 --> 00:03:40.952
BY MY OPERATIONS MANUAL?

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:44.923
COME ON, BENDER.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:46.057
GRAB A JACK.

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:47.837
I TOLD THESE GUYS
YOU WERE COOL.

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:52.013
WELL, IF JACKING ON WILL MAKE
STRANGERS THINK I'M COOL

00:03:52.082 --> 00:03:53.082
I'LL DO IT.

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:55.151
WHOA!

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:28.779
EASY, BABY, YOU
DON'T WANT TO GET
HOOKED ON THIS STUFF.

00:04:28.803 --> 00:04:32.771
AH, NO NEED TO WORRY.
I DON'T HAVE
AN ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY.

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.913
HEY, UH, BENDER,
WHAT ARE WE DOING

00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:43.414
IN THIS BAD NEIGHBORHOOD?

00:04:43.484 --> 00:04:45.184
SHUT UP, SQUARE!

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.988
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.036
WRETCHED SINNER UNIT

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:07.789
THE PATH TO ROBOT HEAVEN
LIES HERE

00:05:07.857 --> 00:05:09.975
IN THE GOOD BOOK 3.0.

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.510
HEY, DO I PREACH TO YOU

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:14.045
WHEN YOU'RE LYING
STONED IN THE GUTTER?

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:15.914
NO.

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:17.249
SO BEAT IT!

00:05:17.318 --> 00:05:19.718
TSK-TSK-TSK.

00:05:19.787 --> 00:05:22.137
WHO WAS THAT GUY?

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:23.138
YOUR MAMA.

00:05:23.206 --> 00:05:25.307
NOW SHUT UP AND DRAG ME TO WORK.

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:33.242
OUR ELECTRIC BILL IS
CLIMBING FASTER

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.927
THAN A GREEN SNAKE
UP A SUGARCANE.

00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:36.796
OBVIOUSLY, SOMEONE
'ROUND HERE

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.999
BEEN WASTING A
WHOLE HEAP OF JUICE.

00:05:39.023 --> 00:05:41.122
PROBABLY YOU.
ME?

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:44.126
GOOD MORNING, BENDER.

00:05:44.194 --> 00:05:46.595
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!
GET OFF MY BACK!

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:49.598
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:50.982
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER

00:05:51.051 --> 00:05:53.602
I'D ALMOST THINK HE
WAS ABUSING ELECTRICITY.

00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:54.671
BENDER? NO WAY.

00:05:56.206 --> 00:05:58.139
I DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE
NOTICED SOMETHING.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.528
BENDER, WHY ARE YOU SPENDING
SO MUCH TIME IN THE BATHROOM?

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:05.296
ARE YOU JACKING ON IN THERE?

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:06.932
NO! DON'T COME IN!

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.283
GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE.

00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:11.520
TODAY YOU'LL BE DELIVERING
A CRATE OF SUBPOENAS

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:14.472
TO SICILY EIGHT,
THE MOB PLANET.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.910
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET TO WORK!

00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:20.078
I'LL BE OUT IN A SECOND.

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:30.572
I KNOW BIG VINNIE SAID
HE WAS GIVING ME
THE KISS OF DEATH

00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:32.486
BUT I STILL THINK
HE WAS GAY.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.876
DID HE USE HIS TONGUE?

00:06:33.944 --> 00:06:35.104
A LITTLE.

00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:41.582
- ARE YOU OKAY, BENDER?
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!
GET OFF MY BACK!

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.002
UH-OH. THERE SEEMS TO BE
AN ELECTRICAL DISTURBANCE

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.303
IN THE COALSACK NEBULA.

00:06:45.372 --> 00:06:48.557
- A WHAT KIND OF A DISTURBANCE?
- ELECTRICAL.

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:52.026
ANYWAY, IT'S GOING TO TAKE
SOME CAREFUL PILOTING
TO AVOID IT.

00:07:08.745 --> 00:07:09.978
WE'RE OUT OF CONTROL!

00:07:10.047 --> 00:07:12.414
WE'RE HEADING STRAIGHT
INTO THE ELECTRIC FIELD.

00:07:12.483 --> 00:07:13.431
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.660
I FEEL WEIRD.

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:18.636
COME ON, UNIVERSE!

00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:21.239
YOU BIG, MOSTLY EMPTY WUSS!

00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:23.925
GIVE ME ALL THE JUICE YOU GOT!

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:33.184
OH, MAMA.

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:50.869
WHAT?

00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:52.353
BENDER, WE DIDN'T MIND

00:07:52.422 --> 00:07:54.523
YOUR DRINKING
OR YOUR KLEPTOMANIA

00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:56.257
OR YOUR PORNOGRAPHY RING.

00:07:56.326 --> 00:07:58.760
IN FACT, THAT'S
WHY WE LOVED YOU.

00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:00.995
BUT THIS ELECTRICITY ABUSE
CROSSED THE LINE.

00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.431
YOU ALMOST KILLED US.

00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:04.833
AND YOU MADE ME FEEL
LIKE A JERK FOR TRUSTING YOU.

00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:06.968
JUST LIKE WHEN MY FRIEND
RICHIE SWORE

00:08:07.037 --> 00:08:08.270
HE WASN'T TAKING DRUGS

00:08:08.338 --> 00:08:10.216
AND THEN HE SOLD ME
MY MOM'S VCR.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.208
AND THEN LATER, I FOUND OUT
HE WAS TAKING DRUGS.

00:08:13.277 --> 00:08:15.576
YOU MAKE ME ASHAMED
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:19.898
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M A LOST CAUSE.

00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:36.631
MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER WAY.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.171
OH, YEAH, THAT'S THE GOOD STUFF.

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.893
WHAT AM I DOING?!

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:51.329
WHAT HAVE I BECOME?!

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:56.852
I SEE A LOT OF FANCY ROBOTS
HERE TODAY

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.703
MADE OF REAL SHINY METAL.

00:08:58.772 --> 00:09:01.339
BUT THAT DON'T IMPRESS
THE ROBOT DEVIL, NO, SIR.

00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:02.340
NO, SIR!

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:04.109
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE
A SINNER

00:09:04.177 --> 00:09:07.445
HE'S GOING TO PLUG
HIS INFERNAL MODEM IN THE WALL

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:11.416
BELCHING SMOKE AND FLAME,
AND HE'S GOING TO DOWNLOAD YOU

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.118
STRAIGHT TO ROBOT HELL.

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:14.819
STRAIGHT TO HELL!

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:16.054
SO I ASK YOU

00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:18.856
WHO WILL STAND UP
AND BE SAVED?

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:20.708
WHO? WHO?!

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.464
ME.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.900
AND AS A FURTHER
COST-CUTTING MEASURE

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.675
I HAVE ELIMINATED
THE SALTWATER COOLER.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.227
THIS IS A WITCH HUNT.

00:09:39.296 --> 00:09:42.680
♪ OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNING ♪

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.583
♪ OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY. ♪

00:09:45.652 --> 00:09:46.885
GREETINGS, FRIENDS.

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:48.803
DON'T WE ALL LOOK
NICE TODAY?

00:09:48.872 --> 00:09:51.573
GREAT. HE'S WHACKED OUT
ON ELECTRICITY AGAIN.

00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:53.875
NO, I'M WHACKED OUT ON LIFE.

00:09:53.944 --> 00:09:57.762
MY FRIENDS,
I FOUND RELIGION.

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:00.848
RELIGION?

00:10:00.917 --> 00:10:03.552
IS THIS ANOTHER SCAM
TO GET FREE YARMULKES?

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.736
GIVE HIM
A BREAK, FRY.

00:10:04.805 --> 00:10:06.771
IF THIS HELPS BENDER
CLEAN UP HIS ACT

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.807
THEN I THINK WE SHOULD
BE SUPPORTIVE.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.860
WONDERFUL.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.280
THEN YOU'LL ALL COME TO MY
EXCEEDINGLY LONG

00:10:15.349 --> 00:10:17.309
UN-AIR-CONDITIONED BAPTISM
CEREMONY.

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:20.552
UM...
OH, I...
UH...

00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:25.206
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY
TO DELIVER BROTHER BENDER

00:10:25.275 --> 00:10:28.309
FROM THE COLD, STEEL GRIP
OF THE ROBOT DEVIL

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:32.280
UNTO THE COLD, STEEL BOSOM
OF OUR CONGREGATION.

00:10:32.349 --> 00:10:33.731
TELL IT,
PREACHER!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.149
THAT EQUALS TRUE.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.734
BROTHER BENDER

00:10:36.803 --> 00:10:39.604
DO YOU ACCEPT THE PRINCIPLES
OF ROBOTOLOGY

00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:42.591
ON PAIN OF ETERNAL DAMNATION
IN ROBOT HELL?

00:10:42.659 --> 00:10:44.442
YES, I DO.

00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:46.644
THEN I WILL NOW BAPTIZE YOU.

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:48.746
PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE.

00:11:04.547 --> 00:11:06.064
UH, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:08.212
COULD YOU TOUCH UP
THIS SEAM?

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.605
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:17.258
THE OLD BENDER NEVER WOULD
HAVE TAKEN US OUT TO DINNER.

00:11:17.327 --> 00:11:19.193
THE OLD BENDER'S GONE.

00:11:19.262 --> 00:11:21.662
HE WON'T TROUBLE YOU
ANYMORE.

00:11:21.731 --> 00:11:24.850
WOULD MONSIEUR CARE
TO SEE THE WINE LIST?

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:29.237
NO POISON FOR US, THANKS.

00:11:29.306 --> 00:11:32.390
I'LL STICK WITH
GOOD OLD MINERAL OIL.

00:11:34.411 --> 00:11:36.010
AH. FUNCTIONAL.

00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:37.962
MM.
THAT'S MINE HERE.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.998
I'M HUNGRIER THAN A GREEN SNAKE
IN A SUGARCANE FIELD.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:45.036
FRIENDS, FRIENDS,
SURELY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO EAT

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:47.271
BEFORE WE SAY ROBOT GRACE.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.089
OH, MAN.
UH...

00:11:50.977 --> 00:11:53.261
IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS
GOOD AND LOGICAL

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.731
WE GIVE THANKS FOR THE CHEMICAL
ENERGY WE ARE ABOUT TO ABSORB.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.433
TO QUOTE THE PROPHET JEREMATIC

00:11:58.502 --> 00:12:00.112
"ONE-ZERO-ZERO-ZERO

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:04.139
"ONE-ZERO-ONE-ZERO-
ONE-ZERO-ONE-ZERO-ONE...

00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:07.675
"ZERO-ZERO-ONE...

00:12:07.744 --> 00:12:10.744
ZERO-ONE-ONE-ZERO-ZERO-ONE...
TWO."

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:12.397
AMEN.

00:12:12.466 --> 00:12:13.982
DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN EAT NOW?

00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:15.349
YES.

00:12:15.418 --> 00:12:19.988
BUT FIRST, SINCE I LOVE
YOU ALL SO MUCH

00:12:20.057 --> 00:12:23.140
I'D LIKE TO GIVE
EVERYONE HUGS.

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:24.692
COME HERE, FRY.

00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:26.961
OH, UH, BUT I DON'T WANT TO.

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:34.986
FRY, YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.874
COME ON, EVERYONE
LINE UP FOR A HUG.

00:12:39.943 --> 00:12:43.177
LET'S TEAR DOWN SOME
EMOTIONAL WALLS.

00:12:50.787 --> 00:12:52.331
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO MY SHIP?

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:54.021
SANCTIFYING IT.

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:59.260
THERE. THAT OUGHT TO CONVERT
A FEW TAILGATERS.

00:12:59.329 --> 00:13:02.280
BENDER'S STUPID RELIGION
IS DRIVING ME NUTS.

00:13:02.349 --> 00:13:03.597
AMEN.

00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:06.667
IF ONLY HE HAD JOINED
A MAINSTREAM RELIGION

00:13:06.736 --> 00:13:08.147
LIKE OPRAH-ISM
OR VOODOO.

00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:10.254
WE'VE GOT TO GET
THE OLD BENDER BACK.

00:13:10.323 --> 00:13:12.302
AND I THINK I KNOW
A WAY TO DO IT.

00:13:12.326 --> 00:13:15.760
WE HAVE TO REACQUAINT HIM
WITH A LITTLE THING
CALLED SLEAZE.

00:13:18.981 --> 00:13:20.798
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SOMEBODY HIRED

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:22.567
AN INTERSTELLAR
SPACESHIP

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.970
TO DELIVER A PACKAGE
TO ATLANTIC CITY.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:26.904
WHAT ARE WE DELIVERING,
ANYWAY?

00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:28.739
UH... THIS.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.142
WHERE ARE WE DELIVERING IT TO?

00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:32.927
UH... HERE.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.297
ANOTHER JOB WELL DONE.

00:13:36.366 --> 00:13:37.749
NOW BACK
TO THE OFFICE

00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:40.819
FOR AN ENJOYABLE EVENING
OF FASTING AND REPENTANCE.

00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:43.438
WHOA, WHOA.
WAIT, BENDER.

00:13:43.507 --> 00:13:46.341
AS LONG AS WE'RE HERE
WHY DON'T WE TAKE IN
SOME EXOTIC DANCING?

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:47.942
HEY, GREAT IDEA.

00:13:50.363 --> 00:13:53.281
BUT THOSE GIRLS
DON'T WEAR CASES.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.317
YOU CAN SEE THEIR BARE CIRCUITS.

00:13:56.386 --> 00:13:57.769
COME ON, IT'LL BE FUN.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.955
MAYBE WE COULD EVEN DRINK
A LITTLE FORTIFIED WINE.

00:14:01.023 --> 00:14:03.708
WHAT?!
DRINKING WINE IS A SIN...

00:14:03.777 --> 00:14:05.759
EVEN IF IT IS
DELICIOUSLY FORTIFIED.

00:14:05.828 --> 00:14:08.079
HEY, BENDER, LOOK AT
THAT WOMAN'S PURSE.

00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:10.498
IT'S HANGING BY
A SPAGHETTI STRAND.

00:14:12.034 --> 00:14:14.702
THOU SHALT NOT SNATCH.

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.354
AND THERE'S HOOKERBOT 5000.

00:14:16.423 --> 00:14:18.300
SHE'S GOT A HEART
OF SOLID GOLD.

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:20.324
HEY, SAILING UNIT.

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:22.026
STOP TEMPTING ME!

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:25.897
FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE,
I HAVE INNER PEACE.

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.248
THAT'S FOR LOSERS.

00:14:27.317 --> 00:14:29.434
COME ON, SIN YOUR HEART OUT.

00:14:29.503 --> 00:14:30.251
GO NUTS.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.397
LIVE A
LITTLE.

00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:33.099
COULD YOU HOLD MY
PURSE FOR A MINUTE?

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.800
GO FOR IT,
BENDER.

00:14:34.824 --> 00:14:36.802
YOU KNOW YOU
WANT TO.

00:14:36.826 --> 00:14:38.225
WELL...

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:44.798
I'M THE GREATEST!

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:49.303
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
THE OLD BENDER BACK.

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:52.406
YOU KNOW IT, PORKPIE.
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING...

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:05.386
YOU KNOW, AS A MAJOR
HOLLYWOOD DIRECTOR

00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:08.656
I'LL BE HOLDING AUDITIONS
TONIGHT FOR MY NEXT MOVIE.

00:15:08.725 --> 00:15:11.993
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ALL
YOUNG AND NAIVE

00:15:12.061 --> 00:15:15.362
I THINK YOU MIGHT JUST
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

00:15:17.967 --> 00:15:20.117
HEY, I'M TRYING TO SCORE HERE.

00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:23.087
CAN'T YOU READ THE
"DO NOT DISTURB" SIGN?

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.845
NO! NO!

00:15:36.219 --> 00:15:37.796
GREETINGS,
BENDER.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.905
WELCOME TO ROBOT HELL.

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:51.915
WHAT IN HELL HAPPENED
TO BENDER?

00:15:51.984 --> 00:15:54.265
WELL, HE DIDN'T CHECK OUT.
THE ASHTRAY'S STILL HERE.

00:15:56.339 --> 00:15:59.406
LOOK, NIBBLER'S CAUGHT THE SCENT
OF VODKA AND MOTOR OIL.

00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:01.942
GO, BOY.
FOLLOW THAT STENCH.

00:16:06.315 --> 00:16:08.866
I'M HALLUCINATING
THIS, RIGHT?

00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:10.367
NO, BENDER.

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:12.804
ROBOT HELL IS
QUITE REAL.

00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:14.821
HERE'S OUR BROCHURE.

00:16:16.176 --> 00:16:17.641
BUT I DON'T BELONG HERE.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.595
I DON'T LIKE THINGS
THAT ARE SCARY AND PAINFUL.

00:16:20.663 --> 00:16:22.379
SORRY, BENDER.

00:16:22.448 --> 00:16:25.683
YOU AGREED TO THIS WHEN
YOU JOINED OUR RELIGION.

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:28.085
IF YOU SIN,
YOU GO TO ROBOT HELL...

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.637
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

00:16:29.706 --> 00:16:31.906
AW, HELL... I MEAN HECK.

00:16:31.975 --> 00:16:33.215
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:34.642
YOU CAN SAY THAT HERE.

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:40.814
WAIT, I REMEMBER THIS PLACE.

00:16:40.883 --> 00:16:42.777
THEY SHUT IT DOWN AFTER
ALL THOSE PEOPLE

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:45.241
CAUGHT SALMONELLA
FROM THE FLUME RIDE.

00:16:52.829 --> 00:16:54.478
LOOK.

00:16:54.546 --> 00:16:57.498
IT'S THE SYMBOL
OF BENDER'S
OLD RELIGION.

00:16:59.969 --> 00:17:02.169
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:17:02.237 --> 00:17:05.272
IT'S AN ACTUAL,
FACTUAL ROBOT HELL.

00:17:05.341 --> 00:17:07.803
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
HELL WOULD REALLY EXIST?

00:17:07.827 --> 00:17:09.638
AND THAT IT WOULD BE
IN NEW JERSEY?

00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:10.928
ACTUALLY...

00:17:13.682 --> 00:17:16.333
WE KNOW ALL YOUR
SINS, BENDER

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:19.236
AND FOR EACH ONE,
WE'VE PREPARED

00:17:19.305 --> 00:17:22.690

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:12.888
THEY'RE SORT
OF SIMILAR.

00:20:12.912 --> 00:20:14.189

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:25.565
OH, SORRY.

00:21:32.441 --> 00:21:33.991
DON'T WORRY, GUYS.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.544
I'LL NEVER BE TOO GOOD
OR TOO EVIL AGAIN.

00:21:37.613 --> 00:21:40.047
FROM NOW ON,
I'LL JUST BE ME.

00:21:40.116 --> 00:21:41.727
UH, DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD BE

00:21:41.751 --> 00:21:43.661
JUST A LITTLE LESS
EVIL THAN THAT?

00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:44.935
I DON'T KNOW.

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:47.788
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SURVIVE
A 700-FOOT FALL?

00:21:47.857 --> 00:21:50.523
AH, GOOD OLD BENDER.
