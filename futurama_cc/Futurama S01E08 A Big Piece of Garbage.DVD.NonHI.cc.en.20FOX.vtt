WEBVTT

00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:04.864
<i>GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE.</i>

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:07.506
TOMORROW,
YOU'LL BE MAKING A DELIVERY

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.608
TO EBOLA 9,
THE VIRUS PLANET.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.004
WHY CAN'T
THEY GO TODAY?

00:00:11.028 --> 00:00:13.128
BECAUSE TONIGHT'S
A SPECIAL NIGHT

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:15.380
AND I WANT ALL OF YOU
TO BE ALIVE.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.550
IT'S THE ACADEMY OF INVENTORS
ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM.

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:20.552
WOW, I LOVE SYMPOSIA.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.321
IT'S THE EVENT
OF THE SCIENTIFIC SEASON.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.657
EVERY MEMBER PRESENTS
AN INVENTION

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:28.460
AND THE BEST ONE
WINS THE ACADEMY PRIZE.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.560
SOUNDS BORING.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:31.808
OH, MY, YES, BUT
NOT THIS YEAR

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:34.900
BECAUSE MY LATEST
INVENTION IS UNBEATABLE.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.334
BEHOLD...

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.119
THE DEATH CLOCK.

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:40.267
SIMPLY JAM YOUR
FINGER IN THE HOLE

00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:41.868
AND THIS READOUT
TELLS YOU

00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:44.304
EXACTLY HOW LONG YOU
HAVE LEFT TO LIVE.

00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:45.561
DOES IT REALLY WORK?

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.330
WELL, IT'S OCCASIONALLY
OFF BY A FEW SECONDS

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.110
WHAT WITH
FREE WILL AND ALL.

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:51.244
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:53.129
HOW LONG DO I
HAVE TO LIVE?

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.157
OOH, DIBS
ON HIS CD PLAYER!

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:39.809
WHO'S THE
GROSS NERD?

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.150
THAT'S ME,
AT THE VERY FIRST SYMPOSIUM.

00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:45.186
I'M THE ACADEMY'S
OLDEST LIVING MEMBER, YOU KNOW.

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:47.500
THESE YOUNGSTERS
ALL LOOK UP TO ME.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.035
WELL, WELL, WELL...

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:51.943
LOOK WHO DECIDED
TO SHOW HIS WRINKLED FACE.

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:54.662
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE, WERNSTROM?

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:57.215
FACE IT, FARNSWORTH,
YOU'RE OVER THE HILL.

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.867
IT'S TIME TO LEAVE SCIENCE
TO THE 120-YEAR-OLDS.

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:02.214
YOU YOUNG TURKS THINK
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:03.504
I WAS INVENTING THINGS

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:05.568
WHEN YOU WERE BARELY
TURNING SENILE.

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:10.361
GO HOME BEFORE YOU EMBARRASS
YOURSELF, OLD MAN.

00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:12.063
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:15.283
I'M GOING TO TAKE A NAP
BEFORE THE CEREMONIES.

00:02:15.352 --> 00:02:16.518
WHO'S THAT JERK?

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.036
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:21.940
HE WAS MY MOST PROMISING
STUDENT AT MARS UNIVERSITY

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.026
BUT THEN,
AFTER ONE FATEFUL POP QUIZ...

00:02:26.764 --> 00:02:28.030
"A-MINUS"?

00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:30.749
NO ONE GIVES OGDEN WERNSTROM
AN A-MINUS.

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:33.435
I'M SORRY,
BUT PENMANSHIP COUNTS.

00:02:33.504 --> 00:02:35.281
I SWEAR I'LL
HAVE MY REVENGE

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:37.785
IF IT TAKES ME
A HUNDRED YEARS.

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:40.058
AND HERE IT IS

00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:43.845
SLIGHTLY OVER 99 YEARS LATER
AND STILL NO REVENGE.

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:45.797
I'M ESSENTIALLY
IN THE CLEAR.

00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:52.587
I'VE BEEN PERUSING
YOUR FORTIFIED WINE LIST

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:56.158
AND I'VE SELECTED
THE '71 HOBO'S DELIGHT,

00:02:56.226 --> 00:03:01.062
THE '57 CHATEAU PART-AY AND
THE '66 THUNDER-SCHEWITZ.

00:03:01.131 --> 00:03:03.498
EXQUISITE CHOICES, SIR.

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:06.078
AND MIX THEM
ALL TOGETHER

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.435
IN A BIG JUG.

00:03:07.504 --> 00:03:10.304
WELCOME TO THIS YEAR'S
ACADEMY SYMPOSIUM.

00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:12.073
I'M YOUR HOST, RON POPEIL...

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:15.076
INVENTOR OF MR. MICROPHONE,
THE SPRAY-ON TOUPEE

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.011
AND, OF COURSE, THE TECHNOLOGY

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.364
TO KEEP HUMAN HEADS ALIVE
IN JARS.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:24.135
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.805
WE'VE GOT A WHOLE LINEUP
OF INVENTORS TONIGHT

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.323
STARTING WITH
THAT UP-AND-COMING YOUNG STAR

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:30.759
OGDEN WERNSTROM.

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:33.144
BOO!

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:34.362
MORE WINE!

00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.714
DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS
OF THE ACADEMY

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:39.384
I PRESENT TO YOU
THE REVERSE SCUBA SUIT.

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:40.468
OBSERVE.

00:03:40.537 --> 00:03:41.737
FETCH.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.234
NOW SIT.

00:03:56.303 --> 00:03:57.568
I SAID, "SIT."

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:58.720
BAD FISH!

00:04:02.693 --> 00:04:03.642
OH.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.976
DON'T WORRY,
PROFESSOR.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.412
IT'S NO COMPETITION
FOR YOUR DEATH CLOCK.

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:10.448
AND WHAT WILL YOU BE PRESENTING
THIS EVENING, GRANDPA?

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:11.561
LET'S JUST SAY

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:13.596
IT'LL PUT YOU YOUNG
WHIPPERSNAPPERS

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.536
IN YOUR PLACE.

00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:15.937
I JUST HOPE IT'S NOT AS LAME

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.139
AS THAT DEATH CLOCK
YOU PRESENTED LAST YEAR.

00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:20.124
EH, "LAST YEAR," YOU SAY?

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:20.791
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.160
OH, MY.

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.024
DID IT PUT YOU YOUNG
WHIPPERSNAPPERS
IN YOUR PLACE?

00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:26.064
HARDLY.

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:28.083
WE LAUGHED
UNTIL OUR TEETH FELL OUT.

00:04:28.152 --> 00:04:29.484
COME ALONG, CINNAMON.

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:32.386
OH, DEAR.

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:34.455
I'LL HAVE
TO INVENT SOMETHING NEW

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.091
IN THE NEXT TEN MINUTES...

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.192
PERHAPS SOME SORT
OF DEATH CLOCK.

00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.944
UH, PROFESSOR?

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.741
OUR LAST PRESENTATION COMES
FROM OUR OLDEST MEMBER...

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:54.242
PROFESSOR HUBERT FARNSWORTH.

00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:55.311
PROFESSOR?

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.340
JUST A SECOND.

00:04:57.364 --> 00:04:58.629
JUST A SECOND.

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.631
PENCILS DOWN,
PRUNE FACE.

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:04.402
OH, YES, HERE I AM.

00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:06.304
OKAY, NOW. HELLO THERE.

00:05:06.373 --> 00:05:10.775
NOW, WE ALL KNOW TELESCOPES
ALLOW US TO SEE DISTANT OBJECTS

00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:14.061
BUT WHAT IF WE WANT
TO SMELL DISTANT OBJECTS?

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.747
WELL, NOW WE CAN,

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.333
THANKS TO MY NEW INVENTION...

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.085
THE SMELLOSCOPE.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.757
THE ODOR TRAVELS PAST
THIS COFFEE STAIN HERE

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:29.794
AROUND THE OLIVE PIT AND
INTO THIS CIGAR BURN...

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.430
AND THIS APPEARS
TO BE A-A...

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.033
DOODLE OF MYSELF
AS A COWBOY.

00:05:37.054 --> 00:05:39.671
BUT THE SMELLOSCOPE
IS BRILLIANT, I TELL YOU!

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:43.241
THINK OF THE ASTRONOMICAL ODORS
YOU'LL SMELL, THANKS TO ME!

00:05:47.781 --> 00:05:48.880
OH, MY.

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:56.037
I'VE WAITED A HUNDRED YEARS
FOR THIS, FARNSWORTH.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.591
I GIVE YOUR INVENTION
THE WORST GRADE IMAGINABLE...

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.943
AN A-MINUS-MINUS!

00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:10.151
AND NOW FOR THE PRESENTATION
OF THE AWARD.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.386
LISTEN, FOLKS

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.365
I'M PRACTICALLY GIVING
THIS PRIZE AWAY

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.324
TO DR. WERNSTROM
FOR HIS FISH THINGY.

00:06:25.736 --> 00:06:27.001
OH.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.773
PERHAPS 149 IS JUST TOO
OLD TO BE A SCIENTIST.

00:06:31.842 --> 00:06:32.774
YEP.

00:06:32.843 --> 00:06:34.926
NO, PROFESSOR.
DON'T GIVE UP.

00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:37.262
THERE WERE PLENTY OF TIMES
IN MY CENTURY

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.464
WHEN I WAS GOING TO GIVE UP,
BUT I NEVER DID. NEVER.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.533
HEY, ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME?

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:43.668
OH, I GIVE UP.

00:06:43.737 --> 00:06:45.670
BY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT!

00:06:45.722 --> 00:06:48.790
I'M GOING TO BUILD
THAT SMELLOSCOPE.

00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:52.660
<i>EUREKA!</i>

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.329
DID YOU BUILD
THE SMELLOSCOPE?

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:58.450
NO. I REMEMBERED
THAT I BUILT ONE LAST YEAR.

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:00.418
GO AHEAD, TRY IT.

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:03.404
YOU'LL FIND
THAT EVERY HEAVENLY BODY HAS

00:07:03.473 --> 00:07:05.339
ITS OWN PARTICULAR SCENT.

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:08.142
HERE, I'LL POINT IT AT JUPITER.

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:13.648
SMELLS LIKE STRAWBERRIES.

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:15.667
EXACTLY.

00:07:15.736 --> 00:07:17.485
AND NOW SATURN.

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:19.820
PINE NEEDLES.

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:21.322
OH, MAN, THIS IS GREAT.

00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:23.842
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T MAKE ME
SMELL URANUS.

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:25.844
I DON'T GET IT.

00:07:25.912 --> 00:07:27.311
I'M SORRY, FRY

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.114
BUT ASTRONOMERS
RENAMED URANUS IN 2620

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:33.167
TO END THAT STUPID JOKE
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:34.986
OH. WHAT'S IT CALLED NOW?

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:36.137
URECTUM.

00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.839
HERE, LET ME LOCATE IT FOR YOU.

00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:39.318
HOW ABOUT...

00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:42.789
NO, NO, I THINK I'LL
JUST SMELL AROUND
A BIT OVER HERE.

00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:44.847
<i>HMM.</i>

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.850
<i>HMM.</i>

00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:53.322
WHAT IS IT?

00:07:54.324 --> 00:07:55.940
OH, JEEZ, OH, MAN!

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:57.292
REMARKABLE!

00:07:57.361 --> 00:08:00.879
A STENCH SO FOUL,
IT'S RIGHT OFF THE FUNK-OMETER.

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:03.331
I DARESAY,
FRY MAY HAVE DISCOVERED

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.518
THE SMELLIEST OBJECT
IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.837
OOH! OOH!
NAME IT AFTER ME!

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.756
I THINK IT'S MOVING.

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:15.976
HMM. PERHAPS THE COMPUTER
CAN CALCULATE ITS TRAJECTORY.

00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:17.312
MY GOD!

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.048
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S HEADED STRAIGHT FOR US

00:08:20.117 --> 00:08:23.201
WITH ENOUGH FORCE
TO REDUCE THIS ENTIRE CITY

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:24.585
TO A STINKY CRATER!

00:08:24.654 --> 00:08:27.171
WE HAVE LESS THAN 72 HOURS.

00:08:28.775 --> 00:08:30.392
WELL, LET'S GET LOOTING.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:39.834
SO THIS THING'S GOING
TO DESTROY THE WHOLE CITY?

00:08:39.903 --> 00:08:41.403
WHAT THE HECK IS IT?

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:44.689
AH, JUST AS I THOUGHT.

00:08:44.758 --> 00:08:48.860
THE ANSWER LIES IN THIS MOVIE
I FOUND ON THE INTERNET.

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:54.733
<i>THE YEAR 2000.</i>

00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:58.102
<i>THE MOST WASTEFUL SOCIETY
IN THE HISTORY OF THE GALAXY</i>

00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:00.121
<i>AND IT WAS RUNNING OUT
OF PLACES</i>

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.592
<i>TO BURY ITS NEVER-ENDING
OUTPUT OF GARBAGE.</i>

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.693
<i>THE LANDFILLS WERE FULL.</i>

00:09:05.762 --> 00:09:07.746
<i>NEW JERSEY WAS FULL.</i>

00:09:07.814 --> 00:09:10.165
<i>AND SO, UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS</i>

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:12.934
<i>THE CITY PUT ITS GARBAGE
OUT TO SEA</i>

00:09:13.003 --> 00:09:14.969
<i>ON THE WORLD'S LARGEST BARGE.</i>

00:09:19.193 --> 00:09:23.461
<i>THE REPULSIVE BARGE CIRCLED
THE OCEANS FOR 50 YEARS</i>

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.730
<i>BUT NO COUNTRY WOULD
ACCEPT IT...</i>

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:28.033
<i>NOT EVEN
THAT REALLY FILTHY ONE.</i>

00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:29.800
<i>YOU KNOW THE ONE I MEAN.</i>

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:33.004
<i>FINALLY, IN 2052, THE CITY
USED ITS MOB CONNECTIONS</i>

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:36.791
<i>TO OBTAIN A ROCKET
AND LAUNCH THE GARBAGE</i>

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.492
<i>INTO OUTER SPACE.</i>

00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:42.113
<i>SOME EXPERTS CLAIM THE BALL
MIGHT RETURN TO EARTH SOMEDAY</i>

00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:44.749
<i>BUT THEIR CONCERNS
WERE DISMISSED</i>

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:45.933
<i>AS DEPRESSING.</i>

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.197
WOW, YOU GOT THAT
OFF THE INTERNET?

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:50.521
IN MY DAY, THE INTERNET
WAS ONLY USED

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.068
TO DOWNLOAD
PORNOGRAPHY.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.891
ACTUALLY, THAT'S STILL TRUE.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.877
Now that the garbage
is in space, Doctor

00:09:56.947 --> 00:10:00.765
perhaps you can help me
with my sexual inhibitions.

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:02.801
With gusto.

00:10:05.806 --> 00:10:07.000
AW.

00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:08.567
SO THAT'S
THE SITUATION.

00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:11.359
DUE TO THE SHORTSIGHTEDNESS
OF OLD NEW YORK

00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:13.828
NEW NEW YORK IS GOING
TO BE DESTROYED

00:10:13.897 --> 00:10:15.663
BY A GIANT BALL OF GARBAGE.

00:10:15.732 --> 00:10:19.301
FRY, WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU PEOPLE
THINKING BACK THEN?

00:10:19.369 --> 00:10:21.619
HOW COULD YOU JUST
THROW YOUR GARBAGE AWAY?

00:10:21.688 --> 00:10:23.154
HEY, HEY, GIVE ME A BREAK.

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:24.538
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT?

00:10:24.607 --> 00:10:26.207
WE RECYCLE EVERYTHING.

00:10:26.276 --> 00:10:28.860
ROBOTS ARE MADE
FROM OLD BEER CANS.

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:30.289
YEAH, AND THIS
BEER CAN

00:10:30.313 --> 00:10:31.908
IS MADE OUT
OF OLD ROBOTS.

00:10:31.932 --> 00:10:33.698
AND THAT SANDWICH
YOU'RE EATING

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:35.951
IS MADE FROM OLD
DISCARDED SANDWICHES.

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:37.752
NOTHING JUST GETS
THROWN AWAY.

00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:39.921
THE FUTURE IS DISGUSTING.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.922
TYPICAL 20th-CENTURY ATTITUDE.

00:10:41.992 --> 00:10:43.424
HEY, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT

00:10:43.493 --> 00:10:45.521
TO CRITICIZE THE 20th CENTURY.

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:47.896
WE GAVE THE WORLD
THE LIGHT BULB, THE STEAMBOAT

00:10:47.964 --> 00:10:49.197
AND THE COTTON GIN.

00:10:49.266 --> 00:10:51.882
THOSE THINGS ARE ALL
FROM THE 19th CENTURY.

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:55.231
YEAH, WELL,
THEY PROBABLY
JUST COPIED US.

00:10:55.255 --> 00:10:57.455
PLEASE, THERE'S NO TIME
FOR THIS NOW.

00:10:57.524 --> 00:10:58.773
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

00:10:58.842 --> 00:11:00.541
WE MUST WARN THE MAYOR.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.576
<i>GARBAGE BALL, HUH?</i>

00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:04.279
THAT SOUNDS SERIOUS.

00:11:04.348 --> 00:11:06.781
VERY SERIOUS,
MAYOR POOPENMEYER.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.250
I GOT BE SURE THIS ISN'T
ANOTHER SCIENTIFIC FRAUD

00:11:09.319 --> 00:11:12.287
LIKE GLOBAL WARMING
OR SECONDHAND SMOKE.

00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:14.405
SEND IN MY
SCIENCE ADVISOR.

00:11:15.558 --> 00:11:16.624
WERNSTROM!

00:11:16.693 --> 00:11:17.992
WELL, WELL, WELL.

00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:20.278
COME TO PRESENT YOUR LATEST
NAPKIN, PROFESSOR?

00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:23.131
NO, I'M HERE BECAUSE
A GIANT TRASH BALL

00:11:23.199 --> 00:11:25.178
IS HEADING
STRAIGHT FOR US.

00:11:25.202 --> 00:11:26.801
SMELL FOR YOURSELF.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.209
HOLY... GEE!

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.127
THAT SMELL COULD
BE ANYTHING...

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:39.997
A FAULTY STENCH COIL, SOME
CHEESE ON THE LENS, WHO KNOWS?

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:43.651
MR. MAYOR, WE JUST GOT THIS
TRANSMISSION FROM NEPTUNE.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.154
Giant garbage ball...

00:11:47.224 --> 00:11:48.706
passed close by.

00:11:48.775 --> 00:11:51.458
Horrible stench!

00:11:56.099 --> 00:11:59.250
THE TRANSMISSION
CUTS OUT THERE, SIR.

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:04.555
NO, I GUESS IT KEEPS GOING.

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:08.993
THERE WE GO.

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:11.979
MY GOD!
THE SENILE OLD MAN IS RIGHT!

00:12:12.048 --> 00:12:13.359
DO YOU MEAN
HIM OR ME?

00:12:13.383 --> 00:12:14.943
HIM.
OH.

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:20.204
Next: New New York in crisis.

00:12:20.273 --> 00:12:21.473
Morbo?

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:22.907
Thanks, human female.

00:12:22.976 --> 00:12:24.871
Puny earthlings
were shocked today

00:12:24.895 --> 00:12:27.361
to learn that a ball of garbage
will destroy

00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:29.463
their pathetic city
of New New York.

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:32.083
Makes me glad we live
here in Los Angeles.

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:33.684
Morbo agrees.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.150
<i>CAN'T WE JUST</i>

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.640
SHOOT A MISSILE AT IT?

00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:42.176
WE'VE SIMULATED THAT
ON A SUPERCOMPUTER

00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:44.424
BUT THE BALL IS JUST
TOO DAMN GOOEY.

00:12:44.448 --> 00:12:46.581
A MISSILE WOULD GO
RIGHT THROUGH IT.

00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:51.453
BUT SUPPOSE WE SENT A CREW
TO PLANT AN EXPLOSIVE

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.515
PRECISELY ON
THE FAULT LINE

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:55.689
BETWEEN THIS MASS
OF COFFEE GROUNDS

00:12:55.758 --> 00:12:58.826
AND THIS DEPOSIT
OF AMERICA ONLINE FLOPPY DISKS.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.080
IN THEORY, IT COULD WORK.

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:04.599
UH, IN THEORY, PERHAPS

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:07.419
BUT YOU'LL NEVER FIND A CREW
WILLING TO TAKE ON A MISSION

00:13:07.471 --> 00:13:09.003
SO SUICIDALLY DANGEROUS.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:12.223
AW, CRAP.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.208
NOW YOU'LL ONLY HAVE
ONE CHANCE

00:13:14.277 --> 00:13:15.376
TO DESTROY THE BALL.

00:13:15.444 --> 00:13:16.761
AFTER THAT

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.630
IT WILL BE SO CLOSE TO EARTH
THAT BLOWING IT UP

00:13:19.682 --> 00:13:22.716
WOULD CAUSE GARBAGE TO RAIN
OVER THE ENTIRE PLANET

00:13:22.785 --> 00:13:24.352
KILLING BILLIONS.

00:13:24.421 --> 00:13:25.719
AW, BOO-HOO.

00:13:25.788 --> 00:13:27.955
NOW HERE'S THE BOMB
I'VE PREPARED.

00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:29.304
ONCE YOU ACTIVATE IT

00:13:29.342 --> 00:13:31.525
YOU'LL HAVE 25 MINUTES
TO GET AWAY.

00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:32.727
THAT'S ALL? BUT...

00:13:32.796 --> 00:13:34.195
NOW, NOW.

00:13:34.264 --> 00:13:36.584
THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF TIME
TO DISCUSS YOUR OBJECTIONS

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:37.731
WHEN AND IF YOU RETURN.

00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:51.957
ODOR AT MAGNITUDE EIGHT.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:54.450
MAGNITUDE 12.

00:13:55.818 --> 00:13:57.452
MAGNITUDE 31.

00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:58.987
<i>WE'RE BREAKING UP.</i>

00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:01.556
<i>TURN ON THE ANTI-SMELL DEVICE.</i>

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.260
<i>HMM, SPORTY.</i>

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:11.598
WOW!

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:14.202
LOOK AT ALL THIS FILTH.

00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:15.951
IT'S NOT FILTH.

00:14:16.006 --> 00:14:17.572
IT'S A GLORIOUS MONUMENT

00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:20.308
TO THE ACHIEVEMENTS
OF THE 20th CENTURY.

00:14:20.377 --> 00:14:22.142
LOOK, A REAL BEANIE BABY.

00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:24.528
OH, A MR. SPOCK
COLLECTORS' PLATE.

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.498
SOME BART SIMPSON DOLLS.

00:14:29.352 --> 00:14:31.502
Eat my shorts.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.354
OKAY.

00:14:33.423 --> 00:14:35.423
MMM, SHORTS.

00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:38.120
FRY, THIS STUFF
WAS GARBAGE WHEN
IT WAS NEW.

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:39.655
LET'S BLOW IT
UP ALREADY.

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.112
THIS JUNK ISN'T GARBAGE.

00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:42.847
I CAN DIG
IN ANY RANDOM PILE

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:44.465
AND FIND
SOMETHING GREAT.

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.694
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET TO WORK.

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:03.751
LET'S SEE.

00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:05.603
IF THAT'S HYPODERMIC RIDGE

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.922
THEN THE BOMB MUST GO
RIGHT HERE.

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:13.021
GET READY TO RUN.

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:14.312
WE'VE GOT 25 MINUTES.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.680
UH, 15 MINUTES.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.533
FIVE MINUTES.

00:15:18.602 --> 00:15:20.434
SIX-H MINUTES?

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.438
HMM.

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:25.640
THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM.

00:15:25.708 --> 00:15:28.860
THE PROFESSOR PUT
THE COUNTER ON UPSIDE DOWN.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:30.394
THAT IDIOT.

00:15:30.446 --> 00:15:32.229
IT WASN'T SET FOR 25 MINUTES.

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:33.898
IT WAS SET FOR 52 SECONDS.

00:15:34.951 --> 00:15:36.317
WE'RE GOING TO DIE!

00:15:36.386 --> 00:15:37.666
RIGHT?
RIGHT.

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:47.178
IT'S GOING TO BLOW!

00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:51.132
HEY, WATCH IT!

00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.744
YOU'LL PUT
SOMEBODY'S EYE OUT!

00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:54.696
OKAY, OKAY,
KEEP YOUR SPACE PANTS ON.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.880
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THIS.

00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:06.414
WE'RE SAVED.

00:16:06.483 --> 00:16:09.433
YEAH, BUT THIS GARBAGE BALL'S
UNSTOPPABLE NOW.

00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:11.135
NEW NEW YORK IS DONE FOR.

00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.487
All in all, this is one day

00:16:18.511 --> 00:16:20.912
Mittens the kitten
won't soon forget.

00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:25.800
Kittens give Morbo gas.

00:16:25.869 --> 00:16:26.950
In lighter news

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:29.587
the city of New New York is
doomed.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:33.858
Blame rests with known human
Professor Hubert Farnsworth

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:36.010
and his tiny inferior brain.

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:40.798
OH, HOW COULD I HAVE PUT
THAT BOMB TIMER ON UPSIDE DOWN?

00:16:40.867 --> 00:16:42.734
I COULD SWEAR I FOLLOWED

00:16:42.802 --> 00:16:44.552
THE MANUAL PRECISELY.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.304
I'M A DRIED-UP HUSK
OF A SCIENTIST.

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:49.039
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:50.608
NO, IT'S MY FAULT, TOO.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.009
I'M SURE I THREW OUT

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:54.878
MORE THAN MY SHARE
OF THAT TRASH UP THERE.

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.558
ALSO, ONE MONTH,
MY TOILET BROKE

00:16:56.582 --> 00:16:58.816
AND I JUST WENT
STRAIGHT IN THE GARBAGE CAN.

00:16:58.885 --> 00:17:00.351
AW!

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.719
LEELA WAS RIGHT.

00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:05.156
THE PEOPLE OF
THE 20th CENTURY
WERE IDIOTIC SLOBS.

00:17:05.225 --> 00:17:06.490
ESPECIALLY ME.

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:08.353
ENOUGH. YOU ALL
FAILED MISERABLY.

00:17:08.377 --> 00:17:10.610
IT'S TIME TO PUT
A REAL SCIENTIST IN CHARGE.

00:17:12.465 --> 00:17:13.363
WERNSTROM!

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:14.731
THE VERY SAME.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.168
DR. WERNSTROM, CAN
YOU SAVE MY CITY?

00:17:17.237 --> 00:17:19.286
OF COURSE,
BUT IT'LL COST YOU.

00:17:19.355 --> 00:17:20.621
FIRST, I'LL NEED TENURE.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.472
DONE.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.757
AND A BIG RESEARCH GRANT.

00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:23.524
YOU GOT IT.

00:17:23.593 --> 00:17:24.642
ALSO ACCESS TO A LAB

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.193
AND FIVE GRADUATE STUDENTS...

00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:27.861
AT LEAST THREE OF THEM CHINESE.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.580
ALL RIGHT, DONE.

00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:31.432
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

00:17:31.501 --> 00:17:32.716
WHAT PLAN?

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.051
I'M SET FOR LIFE.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.186
AU REVOIR, SUCKERS.

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:37.504
THAT RAT.

00:17:37.574 --> 00:17:38.856
DO SOMETHING.

00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:41.108
I WISH I COULD,
BUT HE'S GOT TENURE.

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:44.009
EWW!

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.293
IT'S TIME TO TAKE ACTION.

00:17:59.362 --> 00:18:01.595
STEPHANIE,
CANCEL THE MAID FOR TODAY.

00:18:01.663 --> 00:18:03.097
HAVE HER COME TOMORROW.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.860
WELL, I'M OUT
OF IDEAS.

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:06.233
ANYONE?

00:18:06.302 --> 00:18:07.418
WAIT.

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:09.303
IF WE COULD BUILD AN OBJECT

00:18:09.372 --> 00:18:10.938
THE EXACT SIZE, DENSITY

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:13.106
AND CONSISTENCY
OF THE GARBAGE BALL

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:15.425
IT MIGHT JUST KNOCK
THE BALL AWAY

00:18:15.494 --> 00:18:17.489
WITHOUT SMASHING
IT TO BITS.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:19.874
BUT WHERE CAN WE
FIND A SUBSTANCE

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:23.050
THE EXACT DENSITY AND
CONSISTENCY AS GARBAGE?

00:18:23.118 --> 00:18:24.501
ALAS, I DON'T KNOW.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.487
UH, WHAT ABOUT GARBAGE?

00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:27.822
GOOD LORD!

00:18:27.891 --> 00:18:29.490
A SECOND BALL OF GARBAGE.

00:18:29.559 --> 00:18:30.892
THAT JUST MIGHT WORK.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.721
BUT GARBAGE
ISN'T SOMETHING

00:18:32.745 --> 00:18:35.162
YOU JUST FIND LYING
IN THE STREETS OF MANHATTAN.

00:18:35.248 --> 00:18:37.481
THIS CITY'S BEEN GARBAGE-FREE
FOR 500 YEARS.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.478
WELL, THEN IT'S TIME
TO MAKE SOME MORE.

00:18:39.502 --> 00:18:40.784
MAKE GARBAGE?

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:42.102
BUT HOW?

00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:45.089
STAND BACK AND WATCH THE MASTER.

00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:47.341
THIS SLURM CAN...

00:18:47.409 --> 00:18:48.942
NOW IT'S GARBAGE.

00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:49.960
THESE PAPERS...

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:51.128
GARBAGE.

00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:52.462
THIS PICTURE OF YOUR WIFE...

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.164
PURE GARBAGE.

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:56.149
NOW YOU TRY IT.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.890
BY GOD, I THINK
THE BOY'S GOT SOMETHING.

00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:05.137
COME ON, EVERYONE.

00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:07.172
THE FATE OF
THE CITY'S
AT STAKE.

00:19:07.196 --> 00:19:08.228
GOOD.

00:19:08.297 --> 00:19:09.574
DON'T FINISH
THAT CRULLER.

00:19:09.598 --> 00:19:10.547
THROW IT AWAY.

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:11.665
BENDER, DRINK THAT BEER

00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:13.383
AND DROP THE BOTTLE
ON THE GROUND.

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:14.735
VERY NICE.

00:19:14.804 --> 00:19:16.532
GET THAT ROBOT
SOME MORE BEER.

00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:17.571
HMM?

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.683
WE'VE TRASHED THIS ROOM

00:19:18.707 --> 00:19:19.851
BUT THAT'S JUST A START.

00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:21.092
WE'VE GOT TO GET FRY'S

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.409
MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE.

00:19:22.478 --> 00:19:25.312
People of New New York

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.631
take a lesson
from the 20th century...

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.167
Stop all this
pain-in-the-ass recycling

00:19:30.235 --> 00:19:32.502
and throw your garbage
on the floor.

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:35.689
Go ahead, just chuck it
any old place like I used to.

00:19:35.758 --> 00:19:37.541
Your city is counting on you.

00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:51.706
IF MY CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT

00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:54.859
THIS GARBAGE BALL WILL KNOCK
THE OTHER GARBAGE BALL

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:56.243
DIRECTLY INTO THE SUN.

00:19:56.311 --> 00:19:58.557
AND IF MY
CALCULATIONS
ARE CORRECT

00:19:58.581 --> 00:20:00.776
WE'RE ALL GOING
TO DIE HORRIBLY.

00:20:03.819 --> 00:20:05.369
ALL RIGHT, PLACES, EVERYONE.

00:20:05.438 --> 00:20:06.771
PREPARE FOR LAUNCH.

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:11.275
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO,

00:20:11.344 --> 00:20:15.295
THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX...

00:20:15.364 --> 00:20:17.448
JUST FIRE THE DAMN THING.

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:20.901
OOPS.

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:54.718
BURNING GARBAGE.

00:20:54.787 --> 00:20:56.036
IT WORKED!

00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:01.625
AND SO, ON BEHALF
OF THE ENTIRE CITY

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:04.111
I THANK YOU,
PROFESSOR FARNSWORTH.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.296
I NOW PRESENT YOU
WITH THE ACADEMY PRIZE

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:08.465
WHICH WE CONFISCATED
FROM DR. WERNSTROM

00:21:08.534 --> 00:21:11.068
AFTER IT BECAME APPARENT
THAT HE WAS A JACKASS.

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:15.656
YES! IN YOUR FACE,
WERNSTROM!

00:21:15.725 --> 00:21:17.074
I'LL GET YOU, FARNSWORTH

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:19.276
EVEN IF IT TAKES ANOTHER
HUNDRED YEARS.

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:23.964
AND, FRY, WE OWE YOU
A TREMENDOUS DEBT AS WELL.

00:21:24.032 --> 00:21:27.367
WERE IT NOT FOR
YOUR 20th-CENTURY
GARBAGE-MAKING SKILLS

00:21:27.436 --> 00:21:30.287
WE'D ALL BE BURIED
UNDER 20th-CENTURY GARBAGE.

00:21:32.725 --> 00:21:34.908
SHOULD WE REALLY
BE CELEBRATING?

00:21:34.977 --> 00:21:36.688
I MEAN, WHAT IF
THIS SECOND GARBAGE BALL

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:38.507
RETURNS TO EARTH
LIKE THE FIRST ONE DID?

00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:39.811
WELL, WHO CARES?

00:21:39.849 --> 00:21:42.716
THAT WON'T BE FOR
HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

00:21:42.785 --> 00:21:45.519
EXACTLY. IT'S NONE
OF OUR CONCERN.

00:21:45.588 --> 00:21:48.099
THAT'S THE 20th-CENTURY SPIRIT.
