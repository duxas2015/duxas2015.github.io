WEBVTT

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:06.255
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE VIEW, FRY?

00:00:06.323 --> 00:00:08.606
IT REALLY PUTS THINGS
IN PERSPECTIVE.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.976
I MEAN, FROM UP HERE,
AN ENTIRE WORLD

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:12.989
CAN SEEM UTTERLY
INSIGNIFICANT.

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.050
HEY, NICE SEATS.

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.168
WE'RE CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WHEN YOU

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:57.050
KNOCK A PLAYER DOWN
WITH A BEER BOTTLE,
HE STAYS DOWN.

00:00:57.074 --> 00:00:58.234
I DON'T GET THIS.

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:00.792
IS BLERNSBALL EXACTLY
THE SAME AS BASEBALL?

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:02.327
BASEBALL?
GOD FORBID.

00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:06.531
FACE IT, FRY.
BASEBALL WAS AS BORING
AS MOM AND APPLE PIE.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600
THAT'S WHY THEY
JAZZED IT UP.

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:10.602
BORING? BASEBALL WASN'T...

00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:12.988
HMM, SO THEY
FINALLY JAZZED IT UP.

00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:18.126
HOME RUN!

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:19.656
YAY, YAY!

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.995
RIGHT?

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:23.182
UGH.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.467
OUT.

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:28.252
YEAH! YAY!

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.338
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:32.501
WHY IS THE BALL ON
THAT SPROINGY THING?

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.776
IT'S TRADITIONAL,
JUST LIKE ALUMINUM BATS

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.311
AND THE
SEVENTH-INNING GROPE.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.650
HEY, HEY, HEY!

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.370
I GOT ME A SOUVENIR.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.172
AW, HERE YOU GO, KID.

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:56.898
I'D LIKE
A JUMBO SQUID LOG, PLEASE.

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.666
WE DON'T SELL THOSE.

00:01:58.735 --> 00:01:59.985
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:02.270
LET ME HAVE
ONE OF YOUR YOUNG ON A ROLL.

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:03.622
WE'RE OUT OF ROLLS.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.742
FINE. JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING
CRAWLING WITH PARASITES.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.491
HMM.

00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:13.593
AT LEAST HOT DOGS
HAVEN'T CHANGED.

00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:15.416
HEY, BUDDIES, WHO WANTS POPCORN?

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:17.518
OH, I'LL HAVE SOME.
OH, YEAH. POPCORN.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:24.259
ANYONE WANT
BUTTER ON THAT?

00:02:24.327 --> 00:02:27.378
HEY, I'M STARTING TO GET
THE HANG OF THIS GAME.

00:02:27.448 --> 00:02:28.747
THE BLERNS ARE LOADED

00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:30.894
THE COUNT'S THREE BLERNS
AND TWO ANTI-BLERNS

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:33.501
AND THE INFIELD BLERN RULE
IS IN EFFECT. RIGHT?

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.504
EXCEPT FOR THE WORD "BLERN,"
THAT WAS COMPLETE GIBBERISH.

00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:43.973
MULTI-BALL!

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.547
MULTI-BALL!

00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:50.118
BLERN!

00:02:50.187 --> 00:02:57.626
BLER-R-R-RN!

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:02.513
ALL RIGHT! YES!

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:05.917
MILLER'S ON A PACE
TO HIT 70 BLERNS.

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:09.404
HE'S GOOD ALL RIGHT, BUT
HE'S NO CLEM JOHNSON.

00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:11.973
AND JOHNSON PLAYED
BACK IN THE DAYS

00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:13.841
BEFORE STEROID INJECTIONS
WERE MANDATORY.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.510
CLEM JOHNSON?!

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.314
THAT SACK OF SKIN
WOULDN'T HAVE LASTED ONE PITCH
IN THE OLD ROBOT LEAGUES.

00:03:19.382 --> 00:03:21.702
NOW, WIRELESS
JOE JACKSON...

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:24.652
THERE WAS A
BLERN-HITTING MACHINE.

00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:27.388
EXACTLY, HE WAS A MACHINE
DESIGNED TO HIT BLERNS.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.657
I MEAN, COME ON,
WIRELESS JOE WAS NOTHING

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:31.504
BUT A PROGRAMMABLE BAT
ON WHEELS.

00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:33.712
OH, AND I SUPPOSE
PITCH-O-MAT 5000

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.674
WAS JUST
A MODIFIED HOWITZER.
YEP.

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:36.981
YOU KNOW, YOU HUMANS

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.584
ARE SO SCARED
OF A LITTLE ROBOT COMPETITION

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:41.735
YOU WON'T EVEN LET US
ON THE FIELD.

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:44.522
THERE'S ALL KINDS
OF ROBOTS DOWN THERE.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.390
YEAH. DOING CRAP WORK.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.311
THEY'RE BAT BOYS, BALL
POLISHERS, SPRINKLER SYSTEMS

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.264
BUT HOW MANY ROBOT MANAGERS
ARE THERE?

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:53.981
ELEVEN?

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.383
ZERO!

00:03:55.452 --> 00:03:57.152
AND WHAT A SURPRISE.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.021
LOOK WHO'S SCRAPING UP
THE FILTH.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.889
IS IT A HUMAN CHILD?

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.691
I WISH.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.410
WHOA! DEAR LORD!

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:06.539
WHAT'S WRONG?

00:04:06.563 --> 00:04:09.998
OH, UH, IT'S...
MY... NEW PAGER.

00:04:12.302 --> 00:04:13.234
THIS IS HERMES.

00:04:13.303 --> 00:04:14.602
A PACKAGE JUST CAME IN.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.505
EVERYONE NEEDS TO RETURN
TO THE OFFICE IMMEDIATELY.

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.761
GET AWAY, YOU FILTHY BIRD.

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:23.762
SHOO! SHOO!

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.830
PROFESSOR,
TURN ME OFF QUICK.

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:27.332
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:31.185
SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE.

00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:33.104
<i>ADMIT IT.</i>

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.234
YOU ALL THINK ROBOTS
ARE JUST MACHINES

00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:37.569
BUILT BY HUMANS TO MAKE
THEIR LIVES EASIER.

00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:38.660
WELL, AREN'T THEY?

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.178
I'VE NEVER MADE
ANYONE'S LIFE EASIER

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:42.413
AND YOU KNOW IT.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.826
GREAT NEWS,
EVERYONE.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.151
YOU'LL BE DELIVERING
A PACKAGE TO CHAPEK 9...

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.804
A WORLD WHERE HUMANS
ARE KILLED ON SIGHT.

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.505
WHY IS THAT GREAT NEWS?

00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:54.359
I'M GLAD YOU ASKED
THAT QUESTION, FRY.

00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:57.712
YOU SEE, CHAPEK 9
WAS COLONIZED CENTURIES AGO

00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:01.365
BY A MURDEROUS CREW
OF RADICAL ROBOT SEPARATISTS.

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.201
OH, SO JUST 'CAUSE A ROBOT
WANTS TO KILL HUMANS

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.953
THAT MAKES HIM A "RADICAL."

00:05:06.022 --> 00:05:09.035
HEY, HOLD ON.
I UNDERSTAND THESE
ROBOTS HATE HUMANS

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.592
BUT HOW DO THEY FEEL
ABOUT HUMANOID ALIENS?

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:13.411
THEY'RE NOT FANS.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.041
THAT'S WHY BENDER
WILL HAVE TO MAKE
THE ACTUAL DELIVERY.

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:20.051
OH, I GET IT...
MAKE THE ROBOT DO ALL THE WORK.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.680
THIS IS THE FIRST
ACTUAL WORK

00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:23.599
YOU'VE EVER HAD
TO DO AROUND HERE.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.323
WELL, I'M NOT DOING IT.

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.874
IT'S A ROBOT HOLIDAY.

00:05:26.943 --> 00:05:28.092
REALLY? WHICH ONE?

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.427
ONLY ROBANUKAH...

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:32.363
THE HOLIEST TWO WEEKS
ON THE ROBOT CALENDAR.

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:33.915
OH, COME ON, BENDER.

00:05:33.983 --> 00:05:38.019
LAST MONTH IT WAS ROBAMADAN,
AND BEFORE THAT ROBANZAA.

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:40.171
MAN, THAT ONE WAS A BLAST.

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:41.689
IT WASN'T JUST A BLAST.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.926
IT WAS A SACRED TRIBUTE
TO MY ANCESTRAL PROTOTYPES

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:48.445
WHICH HAPPENED TO TAKE THE FORM
OF A DRINKING CONTEST.

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.198
NOW, LOOK HERE, BENDER,
I RESPECT YOUR DIVERSITY

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:52.983
TO THE EXTENT THE LAW REQUIRES

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:54.914
BUT YOU USED UP
ALL YOUR DAYS OFF

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.221
WHEN YOU HAD
THAT BOUT WITH ROBERCULOSIS.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.957
AW, ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO,
BUT SO HELP ME

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:04.029
I'LL HOLD A GRUDGE AGAINST
EVERY LAST STINKING ONE OF YOU

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:06.046
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES.

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:07.515
WELL, THEN IT'S SETTLED.

00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:10.068
SO LONG, EVERYONE.

00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:13.104
SO, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:16.240
THIS PLANET IS
COMPLETELY UNINHABITED?
NO.

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.810
IT'S INHABITED BY ROBOTS.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.791
OH, KIND OF LIKE
HOW A WAREHOUSE IS
INHABITED BY BOXES.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:25.466
OKAY, BENDER

00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:26.535
WE'RE HERE.

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:27.919
IT'S TIME TO GET TO WORK.

00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:30.104
YES, MIZ LEELA,
TOTE THAT SPACE BARGE

00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:31.973
LIFT THAT SPACE BALE.

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:33.636
NOW, WE CAN'T LAND
ON THE SURFACE

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.855
BECAUSE THOSE ROBOTS
WOULD KILL FRY AND ME.

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:37.807
SO, WE'LL HAVE
TO STAY UP HERE

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:39.676
AND LOWER YOU
WITH THE WINCH.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.678
REMEMBER, YOU
DON'T KNOW HUMANS

00:06:41.702 --> 00:06:43.279
YOU DON'T WORK
FOR HUMANS

00:06:43.303 --> 00:06:45.703
AND ABOVE ALL, YOU
DON'T<i> LIKE</i> HUMANS.

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.638
I'LL TRY TO KEEP
THAT IN MIND.

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:52.827
HMM, HE SEEMS
PRETTY ANGRY.

00:06:52.895 --> 00:06:54.975
YEAH, BUT I GUESS
I'D BE KIND OF ANGRY, TOO

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:57.076
IF I HAD TO GO
TO SOME UNINHABITED PLANET.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.220
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR HIM.

00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:05.056
<i>THERE, THIS OUGHTA SHOW</i>
<i>THAT STUPID ROBOT</i>
<i>WE CARE ABOUT HIM.</i>

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.439
AH, BENDER MUST BE DONE
WITH THE DELIVERY.

00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:10.178
I...

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:11.495
I'M IN TROUBLE.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.865
THEY FOUND OUT I WORK
WITH HUMANS, AND...

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:14.999
OH NO. OH NO!

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:18.614
OH, MY GOD.

00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:21.267
WE HAVE TO GO DOWN
AND RESCUE HIM.
NO, WE CAN'T.

00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:22.423
THEY'LL KILL US
ON SIGHT.

00:07:22.492 --> 00:07:23.836
W-W-WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.195
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S NOT
AN EASY DECISION.

00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:30.297
IF ONLY I HAD
TWO OR THREE MINUTES
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.972
IF WE'RE GOING TO SAVE BENDER
WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AND ACT
EXACTLY LIKE ROBOTS.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.007
I AM FULLY OPERATIONAL,
CAPTAIN.

00:07:39.076 --> 00:07:41.576
WE'LL HAVE TO
WALK LIKE ROBOTS
TALK LIKE ROBOTS,

00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:45.413
AND IF NECESSARY
SOLVE COMPLEX DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS LIKE ROBOTS.

00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:48.282
I CAN SORT OF DANCE
LIKE A ROBOT.
WILL THAT HELP?

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.140
OH, FRY, FIRST OF ALL,
THIS IS SERIOUS.

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:56.441
AND SECOND OF ALL...

00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:12.121
MAN, WE LOOK STUPID.

00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:14.876
WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
STORE-BOUGHT COSTUMES.

00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:17.612
YEAH, BUT THERE WASN'T
A WOOLWORTH'S IN THIS QUADRANT.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.614
HALT!

00:08:18.682 --> 00:08:21.649
BE YOU ROBOT OR HUMAN?

00:08:21.718 --> 00:08:24.186
ROBOT... WE BE.

00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:25.298
UH, YEP.

00:08:25.322 --> 00:08:27.806
JUST TWO ROBOTS
OUT ROBOTING IT UP.

00:08:29.943 --> 00:08:30.858
EH?

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.694
ADMINISTER THE TEST.

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:39.500
WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING
WOULD YOU MOST PREFER:

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.570
A, A PUPPY

00:08:40.637 --> 00:08:43.337
B, A PRETTY FLOWER
FROM YOUR SWEETIE

00:08:43.406 --> 00:08:46.692
OR C, A LARGE
PROPERLY FORMATTED DATA FILE?

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.776
CHOOSE!

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:53.093
UH, IS THE PUPPY
MECHANICAL
IN ANY WAY?

00:08:53.117 --> 00:08:56.134
NO, IT IS THE BAD
KIND OF PUPPY.

00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:57.903
THEN WE'LL GO
WITH THAT DATA FILE.

00:08:57.972 --> 00:08:59.087
CORRECT.

00:08:59.156 --> 00:09:00.939
THE FLOWER WOULD ALSO
HAVE BEEN ACCEPTABLE.

00:09:01.008 --> 00:09:02.374
YOU MAY PASS.

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:12.000
NOW, IF YOU SEE ANY ROBOTS
JUST STAY OUT OF THEIR WAY.

00:09:26.716 --> 00:09:28.132
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

00:09:30.203 --> 00:09:31.970
LITTLE TO THE RIGHT...
THERE YOU GO.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.406
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS ROBOT?

00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:37.720
SORRY, CAN'T
HELP YOU.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:38.944
HEY, WATCH IT!

00:09:38.979 --> 00:09:41.229
DON'T DROP THAT THERE.

00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:42.530
OH...

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:47.713
COME ON, FRY,
WALK LIKE A ROBOT.

00:09:47.737 --> 00:09:50.338
I CAN'T. I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

00:09:50.407 --> 00:09:52.018
ROBOTS DON'T
HAVE BATHROOMS.

00:09:52.042 --> 00:09:53.141
OH, RIGHT.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.109
I WONDER WHERE THEY SMOKE
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:57.390
LISTEN, JUST GO BEHIND
THOSE GARBAGE CANS.

00:09:57.414 --> 00:09:58.763
I'LL STAND GUARD.

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:05.670
HURRY UP, FRY.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.056
SIR, ARE YOU AWARE

00:10:08.124 --> 00:10:09.969
THAT YOU'RE
LEAKING COOLANT

00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:12.361
AT AN ALARMING RATE?
UH...

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:14.791
LET ME JUST
PATCH YOU UP
WITH SOME HOT RESIN.

00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:18.166
I THINK THE LEAK'S
STOPPING ITSELF.

00:10:18.234 --> 00:10:19.517
WAIT... WAIT.

00:10:19.587 --> 00:10:22.037
YEAH... THERE WE GO.

00:10:22.106 --> 00:10:23.755
WAIT... YEAH.

00:10:23.824 --> 00:10:25.056
WHAT SORT OF ROBOT

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:28.276
TURNS DOWN A FREE BLAST
OF SEARING HOT RESIN?

00:10:28.345 --> 00:10:29.294
UH...

00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:30.929
I'M SORRY, UH,
MY FRIEND AND I

00:10:30.998 --> 00:10:33.715
HAVE TO GO PERFORM
SOME MINDLESS REPETITIVE TASKS.

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:37.469
OH... SOUNDS LIKE
A ROMANTIC EVENING.

00:10:37.538 --> 00:10:39.187
I WON'T KEEP YOU.

00:10:51.652 --> 00:10:53.135
GET THE HUMANOID.

00:10:53.203 --> 00:10:54.719
GET THE INTRUDER.

00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:57.255
INTRUDER ALERT!
INTRUDER ALERT!

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.991
QUICK, LET'S
DUCK IN HERE.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:12.381
WE INTERRUPT THIS SOUND FILE

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:14.350
TO BRING YOU A TERRIFYING
ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:16.641
A NON-METALLIC BEING
HAS BEEN SIGHTED

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.793
IN THE VICINITY
OF MAKE-OUT POINT.

00:11:20.113 --> 00:11:23.231
SAY, WENDY, YOUR CHASSIS
IS A LITTLE SCUFFED.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.660
MIND IF I POLISH
IT FOR YOU?

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.387
DID YOU HEAR THAT, RUSTY?

00:11:29.456 --> 00:11:30.922
IT SOUNDED
LIKE A HUMAN.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.424
RELAX, WENDY.

00:11:32.492 --> 00:11:35.004
HUMANS WILL NEVER COME
TO OUR DEFENSELESS
LITTLE TOWN.

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.139
IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE
TO LET OUR GUARD DOWN...

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:38.380
EVEN FOR A SECOND.

00:11:47.223 --> 00:11:53.411
I WILL EAT AND DIGEST YOU ALL
WITH MY SYSTEM OF MIGHTY ORGANS.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.280
BEHOLD!

00:11:56.783 --> 00:11:58.850
WOW! THE 3-D's GREAT!

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.802
MINE'S NOT WORKING.

00:12:06.743 --> 00:12:07.942
FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

00:12:08.011 --> 00:12:09.844
THE HUMAN WAS IMPERVIOUS

00:12:09.913 --> 00:12:12.614
TO OUR MOST POWERFUL
MAGNETIC FIELDS

00:12:12.683 --> 00:12:17.151
YET IN THE END, HE SUCCUMBED
TO A HARMLESS SHARPENED STICK.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.920
I'M JUST GLAD
THE NIGHTMARE
IS OVER.

00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:25.677
IT'LL NEVER BE
OVER, WENDY.

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:27.846
EVEN NOW, HUMANS ARE LURKING
IN OUR PLAYGROUNDS

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:32.551
OUR BREEZEWAYS...
PERHAPS EVEN...
OUR MOVIE THEATERS.

00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:35.036
GOD HELP US!

00:12:37.807 --> 00:12:40.375
OKAY, KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR BENDER.

00:12:40.444 --> 00:12:42.322
SO WHAT DID
YOU THINK OF
THE MOVIE?

00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:43.656
UH... TOO MUCH
ROMANCE

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.158
NOT ENOUGH
HUMAN KILLING.

00:12:45.182 --> 00:12:47.115
YEAH, IT WAS
A REAL CHICK FLICK.

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.302
WHAT'S THAT?

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.919
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT'S THAT?

00:12:51.988 --> 00:12:53.054
IT'S 5:00

00:12:53.122 --> 00:12:55.067
TIME FOR THE DAILY
HUMAN HUNT.

00:12:56.393 --> 00:12:58.109
TRY TO STAY WITH THE CROWD

00:12:58.177 --> 00:13:00.645
SO NO ONE NOTICES
HOW CRUMMY YOU LOOK.

00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:02.242
AW, THAT WAS
UNCALLED FOR.

00:13:02.266 --> 00:13:03.664
I'M OVER HERE.

00:13:07.087 --> 00:13:09.348
I HEARD A HUMAN WAS
DRAINING COOLANT

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:10.839
BEHIND GARBAGE CAN 738.

00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:13.541
I HEARD THEY UNSCREW
OUR LUG NUTS AT NIGHT

00:13:13.609 --> 00:13:15.943
AND EAT THEM
AT THEIR HUMAN BRUNCHES.

00:13:16.012 --> 00:13:18.346
WELCOME TO A VERY SPECIAL
HUMAN HUNT.

00:13:18.415 --> 00:13:20.382
WE HAVE WITH US TODAY
A GUEST

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.617
WHOSE IRRATIONAL HATRED
FOR HUMANS

00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:25.186
MAKES ME LOOK LIKE
A HUMAN SYMPATHIZER.

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:29.558
A NEWLY ARRIVED REFUGEE
FROM EARTH...

00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:31.393
LET'S HEAR IT FOR BENDER!

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:35.858
IT'S HIM.
HE'S OKAY.

00:13:35.882 --> 00:13:38.366
DEATH TO HUMANS!

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.921
AH, IT'S GOOD
TO HEAR HIS VOICE.

00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:49.476
MANY SAID I WAS TOO EXTREME
WHEN I FIRST CALLED

00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:52.546
FOR THE ANNIHILATION
OF THE HUMAN SPECIES

00:13:52.615 --> 00:13:55.716
AS WELL AS SOME
OF THE MORE CUNNING MONKEYS

00:13:55.784 --> 00:13:57.284
BUT AFTER LIVING ON EARTH

00:13:57.353 --> 00:14:02.456
I CAN TELL YOU THAT I AM,
IF ANYTHING, TOO MERCIFUL.

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:08.062
MY GOD, HE'S
BECOME EVIL.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.080
I MEAN, EVILLER.

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.482
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:13.667
AND IF YOU ENJOYED THAT DIATRIBE

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:17.003
THEN YOU'LL WANT TO PURCHASE
MY SPOKEN-WORD ALBUM.

00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:18.940
JUST $18.95.

00:14:19.008 --> 00:14:22.643
ACT NOW AND YOU'LL GET
THIS BENDER ACTION FIGURINE.

00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:24.979
BITE MY SHINY
METAL ASS.

00:14:25.048 --> 00:14:26.308
GOT TO HAVE IT!
RIGHT HERE!

00:14:26.332 --> 00:14:27.698
OVER HERE!

00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:30.902
LET THE HUNT BEGIN!

00:14:41.163 --> 00:14:44.765
NOW, YOUR BASIC HUMAN IS BETWEEN
THREE AND 25 FEET TALL

00:14:44.834 --> 00:14:47.952
AND IS MADE OF A HAIRY, OILY GOO
WRAPPED IN A T-SHIRT.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.286
IS IT TRUE
THEY BITE YOUR NECK

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:50.754
AND SUCK YOUR
TRANSMISSION FLUID

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:52.022
AND THEN YOU BECOME
A HUMAN?

00:14:52.091 --> 00:14:53.624
SURE, WHY NOT.

00:14:53.693 --> 00:14:55.108
ANYTHING IN THE TRAP?

00:14:55.177 --> 00:14:56.760
NOTHING.

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:59.747
TODAY'S ACTIVE HUMANS
PREFER A LOW-CALORIE BAIT.

00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:03.383
WELL, THAT MAKES 146,000
UNSUCCESSFUL HUNTS IN A ROW

00:15:03.452 --> 00:15:06.386
BUT I'VE GOT A GOOD
FEELING ABOUT TOMORROW.

00:15:06.455 --> 00:15:09.423
WAIT.
WHAT'S THAT?

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:12.020
OH, THAT'S THE
OLD, ABANDONED
ADULT BOOKSTORE.

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:13.822
NOTHING IN THERE,
EXCEPT MAYBE

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:16.630
A FEW SHREDS OF MOLDY,
OLD ROBOT PORNOGRAPHY.

00:15:16.699 --> 00:15:18.382
HMM.

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:20.585
SOUNDS LIKE A BREEDING GROUND
FOR HUMANS.

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:23.537
I BETTER CHECK IT OUT.

00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:25.556
OH, YEAH.

00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:29.159
YOU'RE A BAD GIRL,
AREN'T YOU?

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.388
PSST! BENDER.

00:15:30.445 --> 00:15:31.779
WHA-WHAT?

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:32.847
OH, YOU?!

00:15:32.915 --> 00:15:34.314
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

00:15:34.383 --> 00:15:35.916
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

00:15:35.985 --> 00:15:39.753
LAST WE HEARD, YOU WERE UNDER
ARREST AS A HUMAN SYMPATHIZER.

00:15:39.822 --> 00:15:41.942
I WAS... BUT THEY LET ME GO
WHEN I TOLD THEM

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:43.668
I KILLED
A MILLION BILLION HUMANS.

00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:44.736
GOOD FOR YOU.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.254
NOW, LET'S ALL GET
BACK TO THE SHIP.

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.227
WHAT FOR?

00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:48.362
WE'RE RESCUING YOU.

00:15:48.431 --> 00:15:50.013
I DON'T WANT TO BE RESCUED.

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:50.747
SAY WHAT?

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:52.632
I LOVE THIS PLANET.

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.201
I'VE GOT WEALTH, FAME

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:57.337
AND ACCESS
TO THE DEPTHS OF SLEAZE
THAT THOSE THINGS BRING.

00:15:57.406 --> 00:15:59.390
BUT, BENDER,
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:02.693
FRIENDS? THAT ACTIVATES
MY HILARITY UNIT.

00:16:02.762 --> 00:16:04.128
I'M JUST
A MACHINE TO YOU.

00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:05.829
YOU'RE NO MORE
FRIENDS WITH ME

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:07.465
THAN YOU ARE
WITH THE TOASTER

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.817
OR THE PHONOGRAPH,
OR THE ELECTRIC CHAIR.

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.168
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:16:11.237 --> 00:16:13.787
WELL, THAT'S
HOW IT FEELS TO ME.

00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:19.771
BYE, BENDER.
I'LL MISS YOU.

00:16:19.795 --> 00:16:21.394
OH, GO ON.

00:16:21.463 --> 00:16:23.430
GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE YOU GET CAUGHT.

00:16:23.498 --> 00:16:25.310
BENDER, GOOD NEWS.

00:16:25.334 --> 00:16:27.028
YOUR ALBUM JUST
WENT GOLD.

00:16:27.052 --> 00:16:28.002
WHAT THE...?

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.214
IT'S THE HUMANS!

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:32.923
BENDER, DO SOMETHING!

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:37.461
GOT YOU, YOU MURDEROUS
FLESH-PILES.

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:42.861
YOUR HONOR, I INTEND
TO DEMONSTRATE

00:16:42.885 --> 00:16:45.519
BEYOND 0.5 PERCENT OF A DOUBT

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:47.154
THAT THESE HUMANS
BEFORE US

00:16:47.223 --> 00:16:49.656
ARE GUILTY OF THE CRIME
OF BEING HUMANS.

00:16:49.725 --> 00:16:52.209
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I REST MAY CASE.

00:16:52.277 --> 00:16:53.660
THANK YOU, PROSECUTOR.

00:16:53.729 --> 00:16:56.046
I WILL NOW CONSIDER
THE EVIDENCE.

00:16:57.533 --> 00:16:58.727
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:00.245
ISN'T ANYONE GOING
TO DEFEND US?

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:02.803
YEAH. I MEAN, HE MAY NOT
HAVE A CASE

00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:05.005
BUT I'M GENUINELY NOT
A HUMAN.

00:17:05.074 --> 00:17:06.340
QUIET, HUMAN!

00:17:09.145 --> 00:17:10.093
UH-OH.

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:11.461
HE FROZE UP AGAIN.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.080
TRY CONTROL-ALT-DELETE.

00:17:13.149 --> 00:17:14.498
JIGGLE THE CORD.

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:15.699
TURN HIM OFF AND ON.

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:17.178
CLEAN THE GUNK
OUT OF THE MOUSE.

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:18.752
CALL TECHNICAL SUPPORT.

00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:20.771
OKAY, OKAY,
HE'S BACK ON-LINE.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.858
I FIND THE DEFENDANTS GUILTY.

00:17:26.862 --> 00:17:29.613
NO!
LOOK, ONE EYE.

00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:31.999
ONE.
NOT HUMAN.

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:36.319
THE HUMANS ARE HEREBY SENTENCED
TO LIVE AS ROBOTS LIVE ON EARTH.

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:38.589
THEY WILL PERFORM
TEDIOUS CALCULATIONS

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:40.090
AND SPOT-WELD
AUTOMOBILES

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:41.625
UNTIL THEY BECOME
OBSOLETE

00:17:41.694 --> 00:17:44.628
AND ARE GIVEN AWAY
TO AN INNER-CITY
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

00:17:46.849 --> 00:17:48.126
GREAT WORK,
BENDER.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.363
YOU'VE TAUGHT US
TO HATE HUMANS
ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.160
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:17:59.228 --> 00:18:00.288
OH, YEAH.

00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:03.214
WHO ARE YOU?

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:04.681
WE ARE THE ROBOT ELDERS.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.367
YOU DON'T LOOK VERY OLD.

00:18:06.435 --> 00:18:09.236
THANKS.
WE TRY TO TAKE CARE
OF OURSELVES.

00:18:09.305 --> 00:18:10.337
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:18:10.405 --> 00:18:12.757
SILENCE! BRING IN BENDER.

00:18:14.376 --> 00:18:15.709
UH, LET'S MAKE THIS QUICK.

00:18:15.777 --> 00:18:18.245
I'M DUE AT THE OPENING
OF A MINI-MALL.

00:18:18.314 --> 00:18:19.529
HEY! WHAT IS THIS?

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:20.964
SILENCE.

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:22.694
IT IS TIME TO PUT THE HUMANS
TO DEATH.

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:26.048
BUT THE JUDGE
ALREADY SENTENCED
US AT THE TRIAL.

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:28.004
SILENCE.

00:18:28.074 --> 00:18:29.984
THAT WAS JUST A SHOW
FOR THE PUBLIC.

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:32.042
WE ARE THE TRUE RULERS
OF THIS PLANET.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.695
HAND-CARVED FROM METEORITES
BY THE ROBOT FOUNDERS

00:18:34.763 --> 00:18:36.062
OVER FOUR CENTURIES AGO.

00:18:36.131 --> 00:18:38.265
SILENCE! COME FORWARD, BENDER.

00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:41.134
YOU WILL HAVE THE HONOR OF
EXECUTING THE PRISONERS.

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:43.070
SILENCE! I CONCUR.

00:18:43.138 --> 00:18:46.018
HERE...
USE THE CEREMONIAL
KILLAMAJIG.

00:18:50.112 --> 00:18:52.880
UH... I'M A LITTLE
TIRED RIGHT NOW.

00:18:52.948 --> 00:18:56.266
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF I JUST GAVE THEM
A SAVAGE BEATING?

00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:59.069
NO! THE ELDERS
HAVE SPOKEN.

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:01.105
SHOW US THE KILLING SKILLS

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:02.984
THAT HAVE MADE YOU
A MEDIA DARLING.

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:04.408
DO IT NOW.

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:06.693
KILL THEM BEFORE THEY BRING DOWN
OUR WHOLE SOCIETY.

00:19:06.762 --> 00:19:08.979
DO IT. DO IT. DO IT.

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:11.298
DO IT. DO IT. DO IT. DO IT.

00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:13.167
DO IT. DO IT. DO IT.

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:15.352
DO IT. DO IT. DO IT.

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:18.004
OH...

00:19:19.775 --> 00:19:21.358
I CAN'T KILL THEM.

00:19:21.427 --> 00:19:24.828
PLENTY OF HUMANS HAVE
MISTREATED ROBOTS

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:26.497
BUT NOT THESE TWO.

00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:28.365
THEY'RE MY FRIENDS.

00:19:28.434 --> 00:19:30.800
HUMANS ARE NO
THREAT TO US.

00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:33.653
THEY'RE STUPID,
PUTRID COWARDS.

00:19:33.722 --> 00:19:35.672
DAMN RIGHT!

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:39.660
THE FACT IS, HUMANS ARE
COMPLETELY HARMLESS.

00:19:39.729 --> 00:19:41.361
WE'RE WELL AWARE OF THAT.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.457
YOU ARE?

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:44.081
OF COURSE.

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:45.894
BUT THEY'RE USEFUL
TO US AS A SCAPEGOAT

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:48.096
TO DISTRACT THE PUBLIC
FROM THEIR REAL PROBLEMS.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.353
LIKE OUR CRIPPLING
LUG NUT SHORTAGE.

00:19:50.422 --> 00:19:52.973
AND A CORRUPT GOVERNMENT
OF INCOMPETENT ROBOT ELDERS.

00:19:53.042 --> 00:19:55.192
DUH... THAT'S FOR SURE.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.443
QUIET, JIMMY.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:59.396
WELL, I'M GLAD WE GOT
ALL THAT OUT IN THE OPEN.

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:01.293
WE'LL JUST LET
OURSELVES OUT.

00:20:01.317 --> 00:20:03.317
SILENCE! YOU ALL KNOW TOO MUCH.

00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:08.505
ELDERS, EXECUTE FUNCTION
CONTROL-SHIFT-KILL.

00:20:11.594 --> 00:20:13.043
STOP!

00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:16.392
TAKE ONE MORE STEP
AND I'LL BREATHE
FIRE ON YOU!

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:18.865
HE'LL DO IT.
HE'S CRAZY.

00:20:18.934 --> 00:20:20.345
CAN THEY REALLY
BREATHE FIRE

00:20:20.369 --> 00:20:21.579
OR DID WE MAKE THAT UP?

00:20:21.603 --> 00:20:23.570
GEE, I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYMORE.

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:26.340
IT MIGHT JUST BE
FROM THAT STUPID MOVIE.

00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:28.487
WAS THAT ORIGINAL
OR THE REMAKE?

00:20:28.511 --> 00:20:29.459
I DON'T...

00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:30.861
HEY! THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!

00:20:40.589 --> 00:20:41.538
YEP.

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:43.240
SO LONG, SUCKERS.

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:45.859
UH... HELLO, SUCKERS.

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:48.462
HEY, HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:20:48.531 --> 00:20:50.230
I FORGOT TO DELIVER
THE PACKAGE.

00:20:50.298 --> 00:20:52.449
WHOA!

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:04.227
LUG NUTS! PRECIOUS LUG NUTS!

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:06.597
HOORAY FOR THE HUMANS!

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.751
WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS
DID ALL THIS FOR ME.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.304
THIS IS THE BEST ROBANUKAH EVER.

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:17.991
WE WANTED TO SHOW YOU
THAT WE REALLY DO RESPECT
YOUR ROBOT HERITAGE.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.377
AW, THANKS.

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:23.747
YOU DO KNOW
THAT I MADE ROBANUKAH UP
TO GET OUT OF WORK, RIGHT?

00:21:23.816 --> 00:21:25.082
OF COURSE.

00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:27.567
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT
ANY LESS MEANINGFUL.

00:21:27.636 --> 00:21:28.935
IN THAT CASE...

00:21:29.004 --> 00:21:31.488
LET THE DANCING BEGIN!

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.531
HEY, YOU GUYS ARE GOOD.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.500
HOW THE HELL DO YOU DO THAT?
