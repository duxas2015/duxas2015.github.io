00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:07.789
SPACE.

00:00:07.858 --> 00:00:09.808
IT SEEMS
TO GO ON AND ON FOREVER

00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:11.443
BUT THEN YOU GET TO THE END

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.129
AND A GORILLA STARTS
THROWING BARRELS AT YOU.

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:22.470
AND THAT'S
HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.490
YOU STINK, LOSER.

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.474

MICHELLE, BABY,
WHERE YOU GOING?

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.576
IT'S NOT WORKING OUT, FRY.

I PUT YOUR STUFF OUT
ON THE SIDEWALK!

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.865
I HATE MY LIFE,

OH, CRUD.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.088
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
BY THIS POINT IN MY LIFE

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.224
I'D BE THE ONE
MAKING THE CRANK CALLS.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:37.830
HERE'S TO ANOTHER
LOUSY MILLENNIUM.

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:40.811

00:02:58.228 --> 00:02:59.827
MY COWORKERS.

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:01.162
MY GIRLFRIEND.

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:04.432
I'LL NEVER SEE
ANY OF THEM AGAIN.

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:06.751
YA-HOO!

SO I'D LIKE TO DECIDE
YOUR FATE QUICKLY

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.038
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

00:04:17.107 --> 00:04:19.574
AS LONG AS IT'S NOT
ABOUT MY EYE.

00:04:19.643 --> 00:04:20.725
UH...

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:22.243
IS IT ABOUT MY EYE?

00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:23.344
SORT OF.

00:04:24.498 --> 00:04:25.931
JUST ASK THE QUESTION.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.143
WHAT'S WITH THE EYE?

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:28.450
I'M AN ALIEN,
ALL RIGHT?

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.784
LET'S DROP
THE SUBJECT.

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.120
COOL. AN ALIEN.

00:04:31.188 --> 00:04:33.299
HAS YOUR RACE TAKEN
OVER THE EARTH?

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:36.124
NO. I JUST WORK HERE.

00:04:38.061 --> 00:04:39.261
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:41.375
IS THAT BLIMP
ACCURATE?

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:44.916
YUP. IT'S

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:46.485

00:04:46.553 --> 00:04:48.470
A MILLION YEARS.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.656
I'M SURE THIS MUST
BE VERY UPSETTING FOR YOU.

00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:53.804
YOU KNOW, I GUESS
IT SHOULD BE

00:04:53.828 --> 00:04:55.360
BUT ACTUALLY I'M GLAD.

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:57.830
I HAD NOTHING TO LIVE
FOR IN MY OLD LIFE.

00:04:57.898 --> 00:05:00.031
I WAS BROKE,
I HAD A HUMILIATING JOB

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.967
AND I WAS BEGINNING TO SUSPECT

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:04.336
MY GIRLFRIEND
MIGHT BE CHEATING ON ME.

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.105
WELL, AT LEAST HERE
YOU'LL BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY.

00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:09.390
NOW, STRIP NAKED AND GET
ON THE PROBULATOR.

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:16.314
OOH!

00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:19.834
INTERESTING.

EW.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:38.487
YOU KNOW, I'M THE LUCKIEST
GUY IN THE WHOLE FUTURE.

00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:40.288
I'VE BEEN GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE

00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:43.124
AND THIS TIME, I'M NOT GOING
TO BE A TOTAL LOSER.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.542
WHAT'S THAT?

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:46.861
YOUR PERMANENT
CAREER ASSIGNMENT.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.563

00:05:48.632 --> 00:05:50.548
NO! NOT AGAIN.

00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:51.745
PLEASE, ANYTHING ELSE.

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:52.917
TAKE YOUR HANDS
OFF ME.

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:55.203
YOU'VE BEEN ASSIGNED
THE JOB YOU'RE BEST AT

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:56.554
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:57.739
WHAT IF I REFUSE?

00:05:57.808 --> 00:05:59.525

00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:05.080
– BUT I DON'T LIKE
BEING A DELIVERY BOY.
– WELL, THAT'S TOUGH.

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:08.082
LOTS OF PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE THEIR JOBS
BUT WE DO THEM ANYWAY.

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:10.752
"YOU GOTTA DO
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO."

00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:12.253
NOW HOLD OUT YOUR HAND.

00:06:12.322 --> 00:06:15.173
I'M GOING TO IMPLANT
YOUR CAREER CHIP.

00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:17.792
IT'LL PERMANENTLY LABEL YOU
AS A DELIVERY BOY.

00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:19.911
KEEP THAT THING AWAY FROM ME.

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:28.186
HOLD STILL, DAMN IT!

00:06:28.255 --> 00:06:30.522
I DON'T HAVE
GOOD DEPTH PERCEPTION.

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:39.697
YOU'VE GOT TO THE COUNT OF FIVE
TO LET ME OUT OF HERE.

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:40.766

00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:21.849
IT DOESN'T LOOK
SO SHINY TO ME.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.919
SHINIER THAN YOURS, MEAT BAG.

00:08:42.506 --> 00:08:44.817

YEAH, I'D LIKE TO
PLACE A COLLECT CALL.

00:08:58.188 --> 00:09:00.789
YOU HAVE SELECTED
"SLOW AND HORRIBLE."

00:09:00.858 --> 00:09:02.440
GREAT CHOICE.

00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:07.062
BRING IT ON, BABY!

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.971

HELP! WHAT'S
HAPPENING?

00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:27.210

THANK YOU FOR USING

LOUSY, STINKING RIP-OFF.

00:09:37.194 --> 00:09:41.229
WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE PLANNED FOR TODAY.

00:09:41.298 --> 00:09:42.764
LET'S GO GET DRUNK.

00:09:47.471 --> 00:09:50.205

WELCOME TO
THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.327
SHUT UP, TERRY.

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:57.579
THIS IS
UNACCEPTABLE, LEELA.

00:09:57.647 --> 00:10:00.582
YOU MUST FIND THIS MR. FRY
AND INSTALL HIS CHIP.

00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:01.933
LOOK, HE'S JUST A NOBODY

00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:04.036
WHO DOESN'T WANT
TO BE A DELIVERY BOY.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:06.204
I'D REALLY RATHER NOT
FORCE IT ON HIM.

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:09.591
WELL, THAT'S YOUR JOB
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.394

NOW, GET TO WORK!

00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:23.088
LIFE IS GOOD.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.296
WHY WOULD A ROBOT
NEED TO DRINK?

00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:33.075
I DON'T NEED
TO DRINK.

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:35.144
I CAN QUIT
ANYTIME I WANT.

00:10:37.121 --> 00:10:39.437
SO, THEY MADE YOU
A DELIVERY BOY, HUH?

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:41.423
MAN, THAT'S AS BAD AS MY JOB.

00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:43.125
REALLY? WHAT DO YOU DO, BENDER?

00:10:43.193 --> 00:10:45.043
I'M A BENDER... I BEND GIRDERS.

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.995
THAT'S ALL I'M PROGRAMMED TO DO.

00:10:47.064 --> 00:10:48.530
YOU ANY GOOD AT IT?

00:10:48.599 --> 00:10:50.809
YOU KIDDING?
I WAS A STUD.

00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:53.701
I COULD BEND A GIRDER
TO ANY ANGLE.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.082
30 DEGREES...
32 DEGREES...

00:10:56.106 --> 00:10:57.150
YOU NAME IT.

00:10:57.174 --> 00:10:59.874
31... BUT I COULDN'T
GO ON LIVING

00:10:59.943 --> 00:11:01.309
ONCE I FOUND OUT

00:11:01.378 --> 00:11:03.639
WHAT THE GIRDERS
WERE FOR.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:04.395
WHAT?

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:05.897
SUICIDE BOOTHS.

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:09.767
WELL, FRY, IT WAS
A PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.447

YEAH, EVER SINCE I WAS SIX.

00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:21.045
WELL, OKAY.

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:24.849
BUT I DON'T WANT
PEOPLE THINKING
WE'RE ROBOSEXUALS

00:11:24.918 --> 00:11:28.203
SO IF ANYONE ASKS,
YOU'RE MY DE-BUGGER.

00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:31.239
OH, NO, IT'S THE CYCLOPS.

00:11:31.308 --> 00:11:33.375
DON'T LOOK.
DON'T LOOK!

00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:34.976

HEY, DO THE THING.

00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:09.060
I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:10.579

00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:15.683
WE SHARE OUR WISDOM
WITH THOSE WHO SEEK IT.

00:12:15.752 --> 00:12:17.886
IT'S A LIFE OF QUIET DIGNITY.

00:12:17.955 --> 00:12:19.487
FEEDING TIME.

00:12:28.565 --> 00:12:30.832
HMM...

00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:40.208
I'M SORRY, FRY

00:12:40.276 --> 00:12:41.688
BUT I HAVE TO INSTALL
YOUR CAREER CHIP.

00:12:41.712 --> 00:12:44.023
YEAH, WELL IF YOU'RE SORRY
THEN WHY ARE YOU DOING IT?

00:12:44.047 --> 00:12:45.080
IT'S MY JOB.

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:47.332
YOU GOTTA DO
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

00:12:51.138 --> 00:12:52.787
WATCH IT.

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:55.568
THAT'S IT.

00:12:55.592 --> 00:12:57.742
YOU JUST MADE MY LIST.

00:12:58.795 --> 00:13:00.161
OW, OOH, OW, OW, OOH!

00:13:00.229 --> 00:13:01.179
STOP IT!

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:02.497
DOWN BOY!
BAD PRESIDENT.

00:13:02.566 --> 00:13:04.499
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY,
STEP AWAY FROM THE HEAD.

00:13:07.838 --> 00:13:11.318
I'M GOING TO GET
24th CENTURY
ON HIS ASS.

00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:18.579
PLEASE, OFFICERS,
THERE'S NO NEED TO USE FORCE.

00:13:18.648 --> 00:13:20.332
LET US HANDLE THIS,
WEIRDIE.

00:13:23.387 --> 00:13:24.636
OH, COME ON.

00:13:24.704 --> 00:13:27.188
HE'S JUST A POOR KID
FROM THE STUPID AGES.

00:13:27.257 --> 00:13:29.608
KEEP YOUR BIG NOSE
OUT OF THIS, EYEBALL.

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:32.794
NO ONE MAKES FUN OF MY NOSE.

00:13:32.863 --> 00:13:34.696
YEE-AAH!

00:13:34.765 --> 00:13:35.765
OOH!

00:13:43.373 --> 00:13:44.539
DAMN.

00:13:44.608 --> 00:13:47.019
YOU GUYS WERE
TOTALLY OUT
OF CONTROL.

00:13:47.043 --> 00:13:49.510
THAT'S OUR JOB.
WE'RE PEACE OFFICERS.

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:51.346
YEAH, YOU KNOW THE LAW...

00:13:51.415 --> 00:13:53.714
YOU GOTTA DO
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

00:13:58.322 --> 00:14:00.538
OH, WE'RE TRAPPED.

00:14:02.726 --> 00:14:03.658
WAIT A SECOND.

00:14:03.727 --> 00:14:04.992
YOU'RE A BENDER, RIGHT?

00:14:05.061 --> 00:14:06.228
WE CAN GET
OUT OF HERE

00:14:06.296 --> 00:14:07.712
IF YOU JUST
BEND THE BARS.

00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:09.196
DREAM ON, SKIN TUBE.

00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:12.300
I'M ONLY PROGRAMMED TO BEND
FOR CONSTRUCTIVE PURPOSES.

00:14:12.369 --> 00:14:14.352
WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE?
A DE-BENDER?

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:16.521
WHO CARES WHAT YOU'RE
PROGRAMMED FOR.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.240
IF SOMEONE PROGRAMMED YOU
TO JUMP OFF A BRIDGE
WOULD YOU DO IT?

00:14:19.309 --> 00:14:22.010
I'LL HAVE TO
CHECK MY PROGRAM.

00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:23.027
YEP.

00:14:23.096 --> 00:14:24.590
<i>OPEN UP.</i>

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:26.497
COME ON, BENDER.
IT'S UP TO YOU

00:14:26.567 --> 00:14:28.700
TO MAKE
YOUR OWN DECISIONS IN LIFE.

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:31.135
THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES
PEOPLE AND ROBOTS

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.087
FROM ANIMALS
AND ANIMAL ROBOTS.

00:14:33.156 --> 00:14:35.824
YOU'RE FULL
OF CRAP, FRY.

00:14:38.195 --> 00:14:41.112
YOU MAKE A PERSUASIVE
ARGUMENT, FRY.

00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:47.279
COME ON, BENDER.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.447
YOU CAN DO IT.

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:49.471
CAN'T...

00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:53.174
I CAN'T DO IT.

00:14:53.242 --> 00:14:54.375
YES!

00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:57.344
YOU WERE RIGHT, FRY.

00:14:57.413 --> 00:15:00.481
FROM NOW ON,
I'M GOING TO BEND WHAT I WANT

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.250
WHEN I WANT, WHO I WANT.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.420
I AM UNSTOPPABLE!

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.323
AAH.

00:15:15.365 --> 00:15:17.175
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU DID THAT.

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:18.927
YEE-AAH!

00:15:24.224 --> 00:15:26.704
– WAIT!
– NO, THANKS.

00:15:30.746 --> 00:15:33.513
LOOKS LIKE ONE OF US WILL
HAVE TO BEND THIS GRATE.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:35.667
OH.

00:15:45.661 --> 00:15:46.927
GOOD LORD.

00:15:46.996 --> 00:15:48.929
WHAT<i> IS</i> THIS?

00:15:48.998 --> 00:15:52.934
IT'S THE DECAYING RUINS
OF OLD NEW YORK.

00:15:53.002 --> 00:15:54.618
WELCOME HOME, PAL.

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.955
IT'S MY OLD
NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:00.958
MAN, THIS BRINGS BACK
A LOT OF MEMORIES.

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:03.038
KEEP 'EM TO
YOURSELF, POPS.

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:05.979
THIS IS WHERE
I BROUGHT MY GIRLFRIEND

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:07.949
ON OUR VERY FIRST DATE.

00:16:16.776 --> 00:16:19.293
MY GOD.
SHE'S GONE.

00:16:19.362 --> 00:16:22.296
EVERYONE I EVER KNEW
OR CARED ABOUT IS GONE.

00:16:22.365 --> 00:16:24.231
WAIT. THERE'S
SOMEONE YOU KNOW.

00:16:25.801 --> 00:16:27.779
OH... CAN'T YOU
LEAVE ME ALONE?

00:16:27.803 --> 00:16:29.831
I'M MISERABLE
ENOUGH ALREADY.

00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:32.540
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S
NOT MUCH CONSOLATION

00:16:32.608 --> 00:16:34.742
BUT I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL.

00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:37.995
NO, YOU DON'T.
I'VE GOT NO HOME, NO FAMILY.

00:16:38.047 --> 00:16:39.330
NO FRIENDS.

00:16:39.398 --> 00:16:41.131
MY WHOLE WORLD IS GONE.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.945
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
UNDERSTAND

00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:45.030
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE SO ALONE.

00:16:45.054 --> 00:16:46.437
I UNDERSTAND.

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:49.706
I'M THE ONLY ONE-EYED ALIEN
ON THIS WHOLE PLANET.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:52.243
MY PARENTS ABANDONED ME HERE
AS A BABY

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:55.546
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT GALAXY THEY WERE FROM.

00:16:55.614 --> 00:16:57.664
I KNOW HOW IT FEELS
TO BE ALONE.

00:16:59.969 --> 00:17:01.352
LOOK, LEELA

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:05.156
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS WORLD,
BUT... YOU OBVIOUSLY DO

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:06.690
SO I GIVE UP.

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:10.911
IF YOU REALLY THINK I SHOULD
BE A DELIVERY BOY, I'LL DO IT.

00:17:17.837 --> 00:17:19.670
YOUR CHIP.

00:17:19.738 --> 00:17:21.422
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:22.623
QUITTING.

00:17:22.692 --> 00:17:23.974
WHY?

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.976
BECAUSE I'VE
ALWAYS WANTED TO.

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.963
I JUST NEVER REALIZED IT
UNTIL I MET YOU.

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:35.548
WHAT IS THE
MATTER WITH YOU?

00:17:35.572 --> 00:17:38.238
I JUST WANTED TO BE
PART OF THE MOMENT.

00:17:38.307 --> 00:17:41.576
HEY! HE STOLE
MY RING.
SORRY.

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:45.446
WELL, THAT SOLVES THE MYSTERY
OF THE MISSING RING.

00:17:45.514 --> 00:17:47.414
THIS CALLS FOR A DRINK.

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.151
I DON'T WANT
TO SPOIL THE PARTY

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.520
BUT WE'RE ALL
JOB DESERTERS NOW.

00:17:53.589 --> 00:17:55.790
WE'RE UNEMPLOYED
AND WE HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

00:17:55.858 --> 00:17:57.552
WE'RE UNEMPLOYED

00:17:57.576 --> 00:18:00.694
BUT WE HAVE A DODDERING OLD
RELATIVE TO MOOCH OFF OF.

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:06.100
HELLO. I'M DICK CLARK'S HEAD.

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:08.902
WELCOME TO A SPECIAL
YEAR 3000 EDITION

00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:10.904
OF NEW YEAR'S ROCKIN' EVE.

00:18:17.146 --> 00:18:18.428
WHO ARE YOU?

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:20.214
I'M YOUR DEAR
OLD UNCLE FRY.

00:18:20.283 --> 00:18:22.099
I DON'T HAVE AN UNCLE FRY.

00:18:22.168 --> 00:18:23.216
YOU DO NOW.

00:18:27.322 --> 00:18:30.474
BY GOD, I AM
YOUR NEPHEW.

00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:32.610
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:34.178
CAN WE HAVE
SOME MONEY?

00:18:34.247 --> 00:18:36.380
OH, MY, NO.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:39.750
LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND.

00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:42.803
THAT'S MY LAB TABLE AND
THIS IS MY WORK STOOL

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:45.856
AND OVER THERE IS MY
INTERGALACTIC SPACESHIP

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:49.292
AND HERE'S WHERE I KEEP
ASSORTED LENGTHS OF WIRE.

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:51.378
WHOA.

00:18:51.447 --> 00:18:53.430
A REAL LIVE SPACESHIP.

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:55.248
I DESIGNED IT MYSELF.

00:18:55.317 --> 00:18:56.584
LET ME SHOW YOU

00:18:56.652 --> 00:19:00.487
SOME OF THE DIFFERENT
LENGTHS OF WIRE I USED.

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.222
ATTENTION, JOB DESERTERS!

00:19:02.291 --> 00:19:04.191
COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.593
WE HAVE YOU
PARTIALLY SURROUNDED.

00:19:06.662 --> 00:19:08.963
NO!

00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:11.314
GET THOSE BUMS.

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:12.717
WELL, WE'RE BONED.

00:19:12.785 --> 00:19:15.002
CAN'T WE GET AWAY
IN THE SHIP?

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.138
I SUPPOSE IT IS
TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE

00:19:18.207 --> 00:19:21.125
THOUGH I AM ALREADY
IN MY PAJAMAS.

00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:28.132
I'LL GET US OUT OF HERE.

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:36.523
CAN ANYONE DRIVE STICK?

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:37.791
I CAN...

00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:40.227
AS LONG AS I DON'T
HAVE TO PARALLEL PARK.

00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:52.072
IF THEY TRY TO TAKE OFF,
GIVE 'EM AN ASS FULL OF LASER.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.610
PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF.

00:19:56.679 --> 00:19:57.628
TEN...

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:58.740
NINE!

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.047
AMANIA!

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.248
SEVEN!

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:04.034
FIVE!

00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:05.169
FOUR.

00:20:05.238 --> 00:20:06.520
THREE.

00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:07.589
TWO.

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:08.655
ONE!

00:20:08.724 --> 00:20:09.724
BLAST OFF!

00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:13.660
HAPPY NEW YEAR!

00:20:18.017 --> 00:20:20.267
FIRE. FIRE!

00:20:22.488 --> 00:20:24.104
I CAN'T SEE NOTHIN'.

00:20:24.173 --> 00:20:25.405
PRETTY, THOUGH.

00:20:28.243 --> 00:20:29.671
W-WHA... HEY,
HEY! WHOA!

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:30.806
PHEW.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.940
YEAH!

00:20:35.918 --> 00:20:40.421
SO, I GUESS WITHOUT JOBS,
WE'LL BE FUGITIVES FOREVER.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.822
NOT NECESSARILY.

00:20:41.891 --> 00:20:43.807
ARE YOU THREE,
BY ANY CHANCE

00:20:43.876 --> 00:20:47.027
INTERESTED IN BECOMING
MY NEW SPACESHIP CREW?

00:20:47.095 --> 00:20:48.179
NEW CREW?

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.092
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OLD CREW?

00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:53.234
OH, THOSE POOR SONS OF...
BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:55.902
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
I NEED A NEW CREW.

00:20:55.971 --> 00:20:57.637
ANYONE INTERESTED?

00:20:57.706 --> 00:20:58.939
YES. YES!

00:20:59.008 --> 00:21:01.442
THAT'S EXACTLY THE JOB
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.338
THANKS FOR THE
OFFER, PROFESSOR

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:05.813
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE
PROPER CAREER CHIPS.

00:21:05.882 --> 00:21:07.547
OH, THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

00:21:07.616 --> 00:21:09.983
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
I SAVED THE CHIPS

00:21:10.052 --> 00:21:11.851
FROM MY PREVIOUS CREW.

00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:16.006
THIS IS AWESOME.

00:21:16.075 --> 00:21:17.886
ARE WE GOING
TO FLY THROUGH SPACE

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.760
FIGHTING MONSTERS AND TEACHING
ALIEN WOMEN TO LOVE?

00:21:20.829 --> 00:21:24.164
IF BY THAT YOU MEAN
TRANSPORTING CARGO, THEN YES.

00:21:24.233 --> 00:21:28.235
IT'S A LITTLE HOME BUSINESS
I STARTED TO FUND MY RESEARCH.

00:21:28.304 --> 00:21:30.504
COOL. WHAT'S MY JOB GOING TO BE?

00:21:30.572 --> 00:21:34.391
YOU'LL BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR ENSURING THAT THE CARGO

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.404
REACHES ITS
DESTINATION.

00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:39.747
SO... I'M GOING TO BE A...
DELIVERY BOY?

00:21:39.816 --> 00:21:41.265
EXACTLY.

00:21:42.351 --> 00:21:43.667
ALL RIGHT!

00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:46.336
I'M A DELIVERY BOY!
