WEBVTT

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.940
HEY!

00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:48.229
FRY, MON, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE LIVING IN THE OFFICE

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.348
YOU COULD AT LEAST
BE ON TIME FOR WORK.

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.767
I'M SORRY.

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:54.770
I WAS UP REALLY LATE
POKING THROUGH PEOPLE'S DESKS.

00:00:56.273 --> 00:00:57.655
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.192
I WILL NOW OUTLINE
TODAY'S 12-POINT AGENDA.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.661
WE'LL BEGIN WITH POINT ONE...

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.237
CONCERNING OUR PEST PROBLEM.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:14.589
SOMEBODY'S
BEEN LEAVING FOOD AROUND

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:16.324
AND IT'S ATTRACTING OWLS.

00:01:16.393 --> 00:01:20.528
AND I, FOR ONE, AM GETTING TIRED
OF CLEANING THOSE OWL TRAPS.

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.132
NOW...

00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:26.451
AS THIS SHOCKING GRAPH
INDICATES

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.254
OUR WATER CONSUMPTION
HAS TRIPLED IN THE LAST MONTH.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:33.057
NOW, I NOTICE
FRY HAS BEEN HERE FOR A MONTH

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.726
SO I'M APPOINTING HIM
HEAD OF A COMMITTEE

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:37.428
TO FIND
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.729
FRY?

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.046
AM I CRACKING UP

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.148
OR IS FRY'S
LIVING HERE

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:46.949
STARTING TO GET IN
THE WAY OF BUS...

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.979
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.265
YOU'RE GETTING
A HUGE DOSE OF RADIATION.

00:01:57.334 --> 00:01:58.967
AND GREAT LIFT.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:01.403
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME

00:02:01.472 --> 00:02:03.071
TO RECALIBRATE
THESE ENGINES?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.734
HEY, WHEN YOU
LOOK THIS GOOD

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:06.958
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO KNOW ANYTHING.

00:02:07.978 --> 00:02:10.228
PROFESSOR, WE NEED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT FRY.

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:12.191
THAT'S RIGHT!
WE WANT SOME MONEY!

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:13.731
WAIT, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT FRY?

00:02:13.784 --> 00:02:15.150
HE'S A NICE GUY

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.447
BUT WE THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
HE GOT HIS OWN PLACE.

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:18.736
OH, FUFF.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.755
HE'S NOT CAUSING ANY TROUBLE.

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:23.491
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M RATHER BUSY.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.094
I SEEM TO HAVE MISLAID
MY ALIEN MUMMY.

00:02:26.163 --> 00:02:29.064
THIS SARCOPHAGUS
SHOULD CONTAIN THE REMAINS

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:31.065
OF EMPEROR NIMBALA, WHO RULED

00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:34.002
ZUBEN FIVE
OVER 29 MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.548
HEY, PROFESSOR.

00:02:35.572 --> 00:02:37.922
MMM. GREAT JERKY.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.207
MMM.

00:02:39.276 --> 00:02:41.409
MY GOD, THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:43.962
<i>I</i> WAS GOING TO EAT THAT MUMMY.

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:46.147
FRY HAS GOT TO GO.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.098
BACHELOR CHOW...
NOW WITH FLAVOR.

00:02:52.122 --> 00:02:54.322
AND BIGFOOT IS DOWN!

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.207
SHEESH. 40,000 CHANNELS

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:59.644
AND ONLY 150 OF THEM
HAVE ANYTHING GOOD ON.

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:02.191
<i>ALL MY CIRCUITS</i>
IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY...

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.848
ROBO FRESH.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.233
DESIGNED<i> BY</i> A ROBOT
<i>FOR</i> A ROBOT.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.690
I'VE BEEN PROCESSING THIS
FOR SOME TIME, MONIQUE

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.919
AND, WELL... WILL
YOU MARRY ME?

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.261
OH, CALCULON!

00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:26.021
IT FITS!

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:27.689
THEN YOU MUST KNOW THAT I'M...

00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:29.524
METRIC? I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:32.927
BUT FOR YOU, MY DARLING,
I'M WILLING TO CONVERT.

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:39.851
HMM, MUST BE A FRIEND OF THEIRS.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.603
FRY, WE'VE GOT TO DISCUSS
YOUR LIVING ARRANGEMENTS.

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:44.372
WE'VE ALL TALKED IT OVER, AND...

00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:45.651
HEY,<i> ALL</i>
<i>MY CIRCUITS.</i>

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:46.908
MOVE OVER.

00:03:49.846 --> 00:03:50.995
AH!

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.048
FRY, SOMETIMES IN CLOSE QUARTERS

00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:56.401
PEOPLE DO INCONSIDERATE THINGS
WITHOUT REALIZING IT.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:57.835
I KNOW,
BUT I FORGIVE YOU.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.448
NO, FRY, BY
"CLOSE QUARTERS"

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.549
I MEAN THIS OFFICE.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:01.672
UH-HUH.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.519
AND BY "PEOPLE,"
I MEAN YOU.

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:04.593
RIGHT.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.539
AND BY "INCONSIDERATE,"
I MEAN...

00:04:06.563 --> 00:04:08.463
LEELA,
WE'RE TRYING TO WATCH TV.

00:04:08.532 --> 00:04:11.233
YEAH. WOULD YOU KINDLY
SHUT YOUR NOISE HOLE?

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.719
SO WHO'S
THAT WEIRD-LOOKING GUY?

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:16.198
THAT'S A HUMAN.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:17.038
WHAT'S HE DO?

00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:18.301
USUAL HUMAN STUFF.

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:21.254
HE LAUGHS,
HE LEARNS,
HE LOVES.

00:04:21.278 --> 00:04:22.810
BORING.

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:27.315
CALCULON?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN A COMA.

00:04:27.384 --> 00:04:29.517
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED YOU
TO THINK

00:04:29.586 --> 00:04:31.503
WITH YOUR SOFT, HUMAN BRAIN.

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.071
HEY, UH, WHY
IS THE TV GETTING SMALLER?

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.884
WE'LL BILL YOU
FOR THE COUCH.

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:47.902
CHEER UP, MEAT BAG.

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:49.721
YOU BARELY TOUCHED YOUR AMOEBA.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.857
IT LOOKED GOOD,
BUT I JUST DON'T FEEL
LIKE EATING.

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.142
YOU WANT IT?

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.928
NAH, I'M TRYING
TO WATCH MY INPUT.

00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:00.865
I NEED PLENTY OF WHOLESOME,
NUTRITIOUS ALCOHOL.

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:05.320
THE CHEMICAL ENERGY
KEEPS MY FUEL CELLS CHARGED.

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.504
WHAT ARE THE CIGARS FOR?

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:08.673
THEY MAKE ME LOOK COOL.

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:11.076
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY THREW ME OUT LIKE THAT.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.261
I MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY ACTING LIKE A JERK.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.498
YEAH, BUT EVERYBODY'S A JERK...
YOU, ME, THIS JERK.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.334
THAT'S MY PHILOSOPHY.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.136
SO, WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO STAY?

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:23.454
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:26.524
DO REFRIGERATORS STILL
COME IN CARDBOARD BOXES?

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:28.559
YEAH, BUT THE RENTS
ARE OUTRAGEOUS.

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:30.895
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST COME MOVE IN WITH ME?

00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:32.981
REALLY? THAT WOULD BE GREAT!

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.317
Y-YOU SURE I WON'T BE IMPOSING?

00:05:35.385 --> 00:05:38.252
NAH. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A PET.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.958
HERE WE ARE...
YOUR NEW HOME.

00:05:48.982 --> 00:05:51.315
COOL. YOU KNOW,
I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.784
A ROBOT'S APARTMENT
BEFORE.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.419
COME ON IN.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE TOUR.

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:09.601
LET'S SEE,
WHERE TO START.

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.102
OKAY.
THIS IS THE TV AREA

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.338
THAT OVER THERE
IS THE BREAKFAST NOOK

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:15.707
AND OVER HERE
IS WHERE YOU'LL BE LIVING

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:19.394
WHICH IS GREAT, 'CAUSE TILL NOW
IT'S JUST BEEN WASTED SPACE.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.029
IT'S KIND OF CRAMPED IN HERE.

00:06:21.097 --> 00:06:23.381
I DON'T EVEN HAVE ROOM
TO HANG MY CLOTHES.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.610
LOOK, PAL, YOU'VE ONLY GOT
ONE SET OF CLOTHES

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.852
AND YOU'RE NOT TAKING THEM OFF
WHILE I'M HERE.

00:06:29.506 --> 00:06:31.856
WELL, I'M BUSHED.
GOOD NIGHT.

00:06:31.924 --> 00:06:33.658
WAIT. BENDER? BENDER?

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:41.699
KILL ALL HUMANS.
KILL ALL HUMANS.

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:43.167
MUST KILL ALL...

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.402
BENDER, WAKE UP!

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.491
I WAS HAVING
THE MOST WONDERFUL DREAM.

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:51.359
I THINK YOU WERE IN IT.

00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:53.594
UH... UH, LISTEN, BENDER, UH...

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.229
WHERE'S YOUR BATHROOM?

00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:56.692
BATH WHAT?
BATHROOM.

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.144
WHAT ROOM?
BATHROOM.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.083
WHAT, WHAT?

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.085
AH, NEVER MIND.

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:03.187
MMM...

00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:09.461
HEY, SEXY MAMA...

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:11.596
WANT TO KILL ALL HUMANS?

00:07:21.658 --> 00:07:23.578
WE SURE ARE CHEERFUL
THIS MORNING.

00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:26.260
YEAH, THIS PAST WEEK WITH FRY'S
BEEN A BLAST.

00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:29.214
YOU KNOW, BENEATH HIS WARM,
SUNNY EXTERIOR

00:07:29.283 --> 00:07:32.300
BEATS THE COLD, MECHANICAL HEART
OF A ROBOT.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.287
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:37.505
OH, IT'S BENDER'S APARTMENT.

00:07:37.574 --> 00:07:40.608
HE PUT IN CARPETING YESTERDAY
AND NOW MY HEAD
HITS THE CEILING.

00:07:40.677 --> 00:07:43.278
HEY, DO YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
STANDING AT A WEIRD ANGLE?

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:45.513
NOW YOU'RE OKAY.

00:07:45.582 --> 00:07:47.527
LOOK AT YOURSELF...
YOU'RE A WRECK.

00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:49.863
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND
A NEW PLACE TO LIVE.

00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:52.070
IS THAT AN INVITATION?

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.554
LOVE YOUR OPTIMISM, FRY.

00:07:53.624 --> 00:07:57.292
BUT SERIOUSLY, YOU'VE GOT TO
TELL BENDER YOU'RE MOVING OUT.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.377
YEAH, BUT HE MIGHT GET
KIND OF UPSET.

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:01.362
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THAT TO HIM.

00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:03.148
HEY, THERE'S
MY LITTLE SPACE HEATER.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:07.859
WELL, I'M MOVING OUT.

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.088
WHAT?!

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.539
I'M SORRY, BENDER

00:08:11.608 --> 00:08:13.436
BUT THERE'S JUST
NOT ENOUGH ROOM.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.659
NOT ENOUGH ROOM?

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:16.361
MY PLACE
IS TWO CUBIC METERS

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.663
AND WE ONLY TAKE UP
1.5 CUBIC METERS.

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:21.732
WE'VE GOT ROOM FOR A WHOLE
'NOTHER TWO-THIRDS OF A PERSON.

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:25.103
WHAT IF I JUST HELP
THE TWO OF YOU
FIND A BIGGER APARTMENT?

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.354
I DON'T KNOW.

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:29.090
I'VE GOT A LOT OF GREAT MEMORIES
IN MY OLD PLACE.

00:08:30.727 --> 00:08:31.760
AND NOW THEY'RE GONE.

00:08:34.497 --> 00:08:39.634
SURE, IT AIN'T ONE OF THEM
LA-DE-DA ABOVE-GROUND PLACES

00:08:39.703 --> 00:08:43.404
BUT IF YOU LIKE DANK...
FORGET ABOUT IT.

00:08:43.473 --> 00:08:46.407
AT LEAST
IT'S GOT A GREAT VIEW.

00:08:46.476 --> 00:08:48.116
AAH!
WHAT THE...?!

00:08:54.017 --> 00:08:56.551
'SCUSE ME. I GOT TO GO
CHANGE A LIGHTBULB.

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:04.493
WOW. NOW, THIS
IS FANTASTIC.

00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:06.289
HMM, I'M NOT SURE
WE WANT TO PAY

00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:08.457
FOR A DIMENSION WE'RE
NOT GOING TO USE.

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.748
AAH! OOH! EE!
OOH! OH! AAH! EE!

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:13.919
OOH! AAH! EE! AAH!
OOH! EE! OOH! EE! AAH!

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:15.353
OOH! EE! OOH!

00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:20.909
WELL, I GIVE UP...
WHAT'S THE CATCH?

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.310
OH, NO CATCH.

00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:25.324
ALTHOUGH WE ARE
TECHNICALLY
IN NEW JERSEY.

00:09:25.348 --> 00:09:29.150
NOT ONE PLACE EVEN
REMOTELY LIVABLE.

00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:30.719
OH, HOW AWFUL.

00:09:30.787 --> 00:09:32.503
DID HE AT LEAST DIE PAINLESSLY?

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.756
TO SHREDS, YOU SAY.

00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:37.642
WELL, HOW IS HIS WIFE
HOLDING UP?

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.410
TO SHREDS, YOU SAY.

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:40.912
VERY WELL, THEN.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.032
SAD, SAD,
TERRIBLE, GRUESOME NEWS

00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:46.901
ABOUT MY COLLEAGUE,
DR. MOBUTU.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.370
WAS HIS APARTMENT
RENT CONTROLLED?

00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:56.811
WOW.
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.913
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE CRAP?

00:09:58.982 --> 00:10:00.164
IT'S NOT CRAP.

00:10:00.233 --> 00:10:01.911
DR. MOBUTU
COLLECTED
THIS CRAP

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:06.137
WHILE HE WAS EXPLORING
THE WHATCHACALLIT...
UNIVERSE.

00:10:06.206 --> 00:10:09.875
WELL, THIS PLACE HAS EVERYTHING
EXCEPT THE ONLY THING
I CARE ABOUT... A TV.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:13.361
IT'S GOT A TV, YOU YOUNG
WHATCHACALLIT... IDIOT.

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:16.714
OOH.

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:17.898
WHOA, SLOW DOWN.

00:10:17.967 --> 00:10:20.768
THIS PLACE JUST
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE HOME.

00:10:20.837 --> 00:10:22.370
IT JUST ISN'T... COZY.

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:27.459
AH...

00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:29.260
I CAN BARELY MOVE.

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:31.579
IT'S PERFECT!

00:11:20.664 --> 00:11:22.429
MAN, IT'S A TOTAL STY.

00:11:22.498 --> 00:11:25.133
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN 1,000 YEARS

00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:26.901
I FEEL LIKE I'M HOME.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.637
YEAH, IT'S GOING
TO BE FUN ON A BUN.

00:11:29.706 --> 00:11:32.841
YOU KNOW, FRY,
OF ALL THE FRIENDS I'VE HAD

00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:34.175
YOU'RE THE FIRST.

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:40.693
HEY, MON.

00:11:42.051 --> 00:11:43.835
HAPPY HOUSEWARMING, FRY.

00:11:43.903 --> 00:11:46.538
IT'S A MINIATURE
FRUIT SALAD TREE.

00:11:46.607 --> 00:11:47.755
OOH.

00:11:52.428 --> 00:11:54.228
WAH!

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.780
HEY, AMY.
HEY.

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.199
THIS IS FOR YOU, FRY...

00:11:58.267 --> 00:11:59.767
ZEVULON THE GREAT.

00:11:59.836 --> 00:12:02.003
HE'S TERIYAKI-STYLE.

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:06.424
WOW. HEAVY-DRINKING CROWD.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.677
I'D BETTER GO OUT
FOR MORE BEER.

00:12:09.746 --> 00:12:12.180
HANG ON.<i> ALL MY CIRCUITS</i>
IS ABOUT TO START.

00:12:12.248 --> 00:12:15.216
I KNOW, BUT I NEED ALCOHOL
TO POWER UP MY BATTERIES.

00:12:15.284 --> 00:12:17.752
IF CALCULON'S WEDDING
DOESN'T GO<i> JUST</i> RIGHT

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:20.388
I'LL BE EMOTIONALLY
AND ELECTRICALLY DRAINED.

00:12:26.013 --> 00:12:27.712
HEY...

00:12:33.119 --> 00:12:34.752
THESE ARE MIGHTY TASTY.

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:37.689
THANK YOU.
I MADE THEM MYSELF.

00:12:39.409 --> 00:12:41.637
SHH. THE WEDDING'S
ABOUT TO START.

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:43.861
IF ANYONE HERE
OBJECTS TO THIS UNION

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.598
LET THEM SPEAK NOW
OR FOREVER HOLD THEIR...

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.853
IS HE OBJECTING
OR BACKING UP?

00:12:51.922 --> 00:12:53.354
LOOKS LIKE BOTH.

00:12:53.423 --> 00:12:55.623
I'M AFRAID
MY HALF-BROTHER IS CORRECT.

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:57.611
YOU SEE,
I HAVE A TERRIBLE SECRET

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.893
AND THAT SECRET IS...

00:13:00.062 --> 00:13:01.173
OH, COME ON!

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.564
OH, FIX IT.

00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:05.466
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TV?

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:06.934
IT JUST WENT OUT.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.615
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.
I'M GOING TO GO
YELL AT THE MANAGER.

00:13:11.775 --> 00:13:13.041
ALL RIGHT!

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.576
COME BACK, BENDER!
IT'S WORKING!

00:13:15.645 --> 00:13:18.329
TO REITERATE,
MY TERRIBLE SECRET IS...

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:22.734
IT'S OUT AGAIN.

00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:25.503
WHAT? THAT'S
THE LAST STRAW.

00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:27.655
IT'S BACK ON!

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.725
PARDON ME.

00:13:31.794 --> 00:13:34.395
I DON'T MEAN TO PRY INTO
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN HERE

00:13:34.464 --> 00:13:36.508
WITH THE CRAB AND THE ONE-EYED
LADY AND THE CHINESE GIRL,

00:13:36.532 --> 00:13:40.034
BUT EVERYONE ON THIS FLOOR
IS HAVING TROUBLE
WITH THEIR TV RECEPTION.

00:13:40.103 --> 00:13:42.581
YEAH, AND YOU BETTER
GET RID OF WHATEVER'S
CAUSING IT

00:13:42.605 --> 00:13:44.267
OR WE'RE OUT
OF THIS DUMP.

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.090
RELAX, SONNY.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:49.327
THIS CAJIGGER'LL FIND
THE SOURCE OF THE INTERFERENCE.

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.695
WE WANT OUR TV BACK.

00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:12.995
THERE'S YOUR
PROBLEM.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:15.636
OH, MY GOD.
BENDER, IT'S YOUR THINGY.

00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:19.307
YOU PEOPLE ARE NUTS.

00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:22.910
MY ANTENNA NEVER
INTERFERED WITH
MY OLD TV.

00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:25.513
YOU HAD CABLE.
THIS IS SATELLITE.

00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:26.864
OBVIOUSLY, YOUR THOUGHTS

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:29.234
ARE BEING TRANSMITTED
ON THE SAME FREQUENCY.

00:14:29.302 --> 00:14:31.636
THEY'RE ON MY
CELL PHONE, TOO.

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:34.355
MADAME, I BELIEVE
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

00:14:34.424 --> 00:14:37.208
WOW, THAT LADY'S GOT A HUGE ASS.

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:39.543
THOSE COULD BE ANYONE'S
THOUGHTS, FAT-ASS.

00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:43.014
THE ROBOT HAS TO GO.

00:14:43.083 --> 00:14:44.593
YEAH!

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:46.211
WELL, YOU HEARD
THE MOB.

00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:47.535
FINE. COME ON, FRY.

00:14:47.604 --> 00:14:49.403
LET'S MOVE
TO THAT APARTMENT

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.205
THAT SMELLED
LIKE A SEWER.

00:14:51.273 --> 00:14:53.024
YOU LIKED
THAT ONE, RIGHT?

00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:55.037
OH, IT'S TEMPTING,
BUT, WELL...

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.339
I<i> AM</i> ALREADY KIND
OF SETTLED IN HERE.

00:14:57.363 --> 00:15:00.381
OR WE COULD LIVE UNDERGROUND
WITH THE MUTANTS.

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:02.984
A LITTLE FIRE'LL SHOW THEM
WHO'S BOSS.

00:15:03.053 --> 00:15:06.554
UH... LISTEN, IS THERE MAYBE
SOME WAY WE COULD DO THIS

00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:08.734
WITH YOU GOING
AND ME NOT GOING?

00:15:08.758 --> 00:15:10.257
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.607
WELL, YOU WERE GOING TO
LIVE IN THE CLOSET ANYWAY.

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:14.907
WON'T YOU BE JUST AS HAPPY
BACK IN YOUR OLD PLACE?

00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:17.414
BUT... THEN
WE WOULDN'T BE ROOMMATES.

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:20.752
I'LL COME VISIT SOMETIME,
AND YOU CAN VISIT ME HERE.

00:15:20.821 --> 00:15:22.053
NO, HE CAN'T.

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.866
ANYWAY, I'M SURE
IT'LL WORK OUT.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.473
THIS WAY WE'LL
BOTH BE HAPPY.

00:15:26.542 --> 00:15:29.110
HAPPY. YEAH, THAT'S BENDER.

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:32.013
ALWAYS HAPPY.

00:15:34.717 --> 00:15:36.428
HEY, THE TV's BACK ON!

00:15:36.452 --> 00:15:38.953
WE ARE GATHERED TO MOURN

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:41.089
THE DEATH OF CALCULON,

00:15:41.157 --> 00:15:43.892
INDUSTRIALIST,
PRIVATE EYE, FRIEND.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.560
MIND IF<i> I</i> GIVE THE EULOGY?

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:50.531
CALCULON! YOU'RE ALIVE!

00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:55.002
YAY! CALCULON'S BACK!

00:15:57.407 --> 00:15:58.634
RIGHT. SO LONG.

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:00.891
GOOD-BYE.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.006
DO YOU THINK
CALCULON'S EVIL TWIN
WILL EVER WALK AGAIN?

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.331
I DON'T KNOW, AMY.
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.334
WAH!
HEY, THANKS FOR COMING.

00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:12.337
FRY, YOU'RE BENDER'S
BEST FRIEND.

00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:14.445
HOW COULD YOU LET THAT MOB
KICK HIM OUT?

00:16:14.491 --> 00:16:17.124
AW, COME ON.
BENDER LOVES MOBS.

00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:19.510
ONLY WHEN HE'S IN THEM,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:21.262
YOU REALLY HURT HIS FEELINGS.

00:16:21.331 --> 00:16:23.392
DON'T GIRL ME WITH
THAT GIRL STUFF.

00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:24.727
BENDER AND
ME ARE GUYS.

00:16:24.751 --> 00:16:26.228
GUYS DON'T
HAVE FEELINGS.

00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:28.853
BENDER'S NOT A GUY;
HE'S A ROBOT.

00:16:28.922 --> 00:16:30.521
SAME THING.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.794
IT'S SO BIG AND EMPTY.

00:16:39.416 --> 00:16:42.784
MY ROOMMATE'S GONE,
AND ALL HE LEFT BEHIND WAS

00:16:42.852 --> 00:16:45.453
AN EYELASH
AND THREE SKIN FLAKES.

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:54.379
AW... WHAT'S THE POINT?!

00:16:59.802 --> 00:17:01.152
BENDER?

00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:03.387
MY GOD,
YOU'RE A MESS.

00:17:06.776 --> 00:17:08.588
LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:17:08.612 --> 00:17:10.428
LOOK AT THAT FIVE O'CLOCK RUST.

00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:13.465
YOU'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT
NOT DRINKING, HAVEN'T YOU?

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:16.801
HEY... WHAT I DON'T DO
IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.886
PLEASE, BENDER,
HAVE SOME MALT LIQUOR...

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:21.756
IF NOT FOR YOURSELF, THEN
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU.

00:17:21.825 --> 00:17:25.176
I HATE THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE ME,
AND THEY HATE ME.

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:26.477
OH, NOW, LOOK

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:29.347
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU MISS
BEING FRY'S ROOMMATE

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:31.627
BUT THERE'S GOT
TO BE A BETTER WAY
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:35.253
LIKE HOW,
HAVING MY ANTENNA REMOVED?

00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:37.349
WELL... IF
THAT WOULD WORK.

00:17:37.373 --> 00:17:40.941
ARE YOU CRAZY?!
THAT'S LITTLE BENDER
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:17:41.011 --> 00:17:42.593
I CAN'T CUT IT OFF.

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:46.231
YOU'RE NOT A ROBOT OR A MAN,
SO YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

00:17:46.299 --> 00:17:47.848
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

00:17:47.917 --> 00:17:49.550
WAIT.

00:17:49.618 --> 00:17:51.619
I WANT YOU
TO LOOK ME IN THE EYE

00:17:51.688 --> 00:17:53.754
AND PROMISE YOU WON'T
GET BEHIND THE WHEEL

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:56.491
WITHOUT SOME KIND OF ALCOHOLIC
BEVERAGE IN YOUR HAND.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.293
I PROMISE NOTHING!

00:18:28.458 --> 00:18:30.135
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO...

00:18:30.159 --> 00:18:31.192
WHY IS...

00:18:38.268 --> 00:18:39.884
WHAT UP?

00:18:39.936 --> 00:18:42.570
I CAN'T JUST
STAND BY AND BE SILENT
ABOUT BENDER ANYMORE.

00:18:42.639 --> 00:18:46.023
SILENT? YOU'VE BEEN MEDDLING
FOR TWO SOLID WEEKS.

00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:48.037
WELL, I CAN'T JUST
DO<i> THAT</i> ANYMORE.

00:18:48.061 --> 00:18:50.239
YOUR BEST FRIEND IS
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE

00:18:50.263 --> 00:18:51.373
DESTROYING HIMSELF.

00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:52.780
REALLY?

00:18:52.849 --> 00:18:55.015
I DIDN'T THINK HE'D MISS
THIS APARTMENT THAT MUCH.

00:18:55.084 --> 00:18:56.979
HE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THE APARTMENT.

00:18:57.003 --> 00:18:59.837
HE CARES ABOUT YOU, AND
YOU TURNED YOUR BACK ON HIM.

00:18:59.906 --> 00:19:01.388
OH, MAN, I HAD NO IDEA.

00:19:01.457 --> 00:19:04.642
IF ONLY I KNEW WHERE HE WAS,
I'D GO TALK TO HIM.

00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:08.345
OH, STUPID TV.

00:19:09.499 --> 00:19:10.598
BENDER.

00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:12.584
YOU'RE BLIND
STINKING SOBER.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:14.752
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M SOBER AND CRAZY

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.648
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I MIGHT DO.

00:19:16.672 --> 00:19:19.640
DON'T DO IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YET.

00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:21.609
OH, YEAH, NOW I REMEMBER.

00:19:21.677 --> 00:19:24.745
I THOUGHT I COULD LIVE ALONE,
BUT I CAN'T

00:19:24.814 --> 00:19:29.283
SO I'M GOING TO DO WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE YOUR ROOMMATE AGAIN.

00:19:29.352 --> 00:19:30.535
BENDER, STOP.

00:19:30.603 --> 00:19:32.720
CUTTING LEELA'S HEAD OFF
WON'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:35.423
NO, I'M GOING TO
CHOP OFF MY ANTENNA.

00:19:35.492 --> 00:19:37.575
HEY... YEAH,
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

00:19:37.644 --> 00:19:39.209
CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND?

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:41.895
FRY, DON'T HELP HIM
MUTILATE HIMSELF.

00:19:41.964 --> 00:19:43.380
BUT IT'S A USELESS ANTENNA.

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:45.783
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S
A HAM RADIO OR SOMETHING.

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.184
I'M GOING TO DO IT!

00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:49.119
I'M REALLY GOING TO DO IT!

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:50.771
DON'T TRY AND STOP ME!

00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:53.407
HERE GOES!

00:19:54.577 --> 00:19:56.677
OHH...

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.219
HEY, IT WORKED.

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:06.420
THE STATIC'S GONE.

00:20:06.489 --> 00:20:08.956
I HATE THAT THIS CAME
BETWEEN US, CALCULON.

00:20:09.025 --> 00:20:10.358
ME, TOO.

00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:13.556
I'M FILLED WITH
A LARGE NUMBER OF
POWERFUL EMOTIONS.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.012
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:17.214
I'M SORRY
I TREATED YOU SO BADLY.

00:20:17.283 --> 00:20:18.633
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

00:20:18.702 --> 00:20:21.101
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE ONLY HUMAN.

00:20:23.239 --> 00:20:26.190
YOU GUYS COULD LEARN A
LESSON FROM THOSE TWO.

00:20:26.259 --> 00:20:27.558
SHE'S RIGHT.

00:20:27.627 --> 00:20:29.727
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND, FRY.

00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:32.430
I'M SORRY
I TREATED YOU SO BADLY.

00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:33.898
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:36.267
AFTER ALL,
YOU'RE ONLY HUMAN.

00:20:37.887 --> 00:20:39.002
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.166
YOU DID IT
ALL BACKWARDS.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.656
FRY'S THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE...

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.009
OH, NEVER MIND.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.097
OH...

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:52.516
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING.

00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:56.237
I GUESS I'M JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO GET USED
TO BEING HALF A ROBOT.

00:20:56.305 --> 00:20:57.472
AW, THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.840
LISTEN, BENDER, IF
WE FOUND YOUR ANTENNA

00:20:59.909 --> 00:21:01.587
COULD THEY STILL
REATTACH IT?

00:21:01.611 --> 00:21:05.395
MAYBE, IF WE GET IT ON ICE
RIGHT AWAY.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.182
BINGO.

00:21:08.251 --> 00:21:12.820
HMM. YOU CALL
THAT AN ANTENNA?

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:18.826
THIS TIME YOU'LL HAVE
ALL THE HUMAN COMFORTS.

00:21:18.894 --> 00:21:21.161
WE'LL GET A
COUPLE OF TOILETS

00:21:21.231 --> 00:21:23.997
SOME FOOD COOKERS,
MAYBE A PUPPY...

00:21:28.638 --> 00:21:30.015
IT'S GOOD
TO BE HOME.

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.272
IT SURE IS.

00:21:31.341 --> 00:21:32.973
BY THE WAY,
I SAVED YOUR STUFF.

00:21:33.042 --> 00:21:35.777
SO<i> THAT'S</i> WHERE
THOSE SKIN FLAKES WENT.

00:21:35.845 --> 00:21:37.723
HMM. YOU THINK
THIS FRUIT TREE'S

00:21:37.747 --> 00:21:39.208
GOING TO GET
ENOUGH LIGHT?

00:21:39.232 --> 00:21:41.415
THERE'S A WINDOW
IN THE CLOSET.

00:21:41.484 --> 00:21:44.919
WHOA.

00:21:44.988 --> 00:21:46.453
THIS IS HUGE.

00:21:46.522 --> 00:21:49.040
BENDER, WHY DON'T
I JUST LIVE IN HERE?

00:21:49.108 --> 00:21:50.591
IN A CLOSET?

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.020
OH, HUMANS.
