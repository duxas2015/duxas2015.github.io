WEBVTT

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.120
THIS PLACE WAS
A GREAT CHOICE.

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:06.672
THE FOOD IS AMAZING.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.457
AND SUCH GENEROUS PORTIONS.

00:00:08.526 --> 00:00:09.875
IF YOU LIKED THE MEAL

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.688
JUST WAIT TILL YOU TRY
THESE AFTER-DINNER MINTS.

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.112
YOU KNOW, DOUG, MOST GUYS
ARE PUT OFF BY MY EYE.

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.882
IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MEET
SOMEONE WHO'S OPEN-MINDED.

00:00:19.403 --> 00:00:20.769
EW!

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:53.313
<i>WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH YOUR DATE LAST NIGHT?</i>

00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:57.004
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING I COULDN'T
QUITE PUT MY FINGER ON.

00:00:57.073 --> 00:00:59.201
POSSIBLY HIS VILE
LIZARD TONGUE.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.626
YOU'RE TOO PICKY.
YEAH.

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:02.894
IF YOU RULE OUT EVERY GUY

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.563
WITH A LIZARD TONGUE
OR A LOW I.Q.

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:06.130
OR AN EXPLOSIVE,
VIOLENT TEMPER

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.899
OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING
TO BE LONELY.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.352
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH HAVING HIGH STANDARDS.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.335
NOW, CAN WE PLEASE...

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.770
THE FEMALE LEELA'S PROBLEM

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:14.172
IS PURELY MEDICAL.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.741
SOON SHE WILL DROP HER EGGS
AND THEY WILL HATCH

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:18.392
AND ALL WILL BE WELL.

00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:20.172
YOU JUST HAVE TO
GIVE GUYS A CHANCE.

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:22.341
SOMETIMES YOU MEET A GUY
AND THINK HE'S A PIG

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:25.545
BUT THEN LATER ON,
YOU REALIZE HE ACTUALLY
HAS A REALLY GOOD BODY.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.019
THANK YOU ALL
FOR THE INSPIRING ADVICE

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.048
BUT I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY
WITH MY LIFE

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:31.306
THE WAY IT IS.

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:33.520
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A CRY FOR HELP.

00:01:33.544 --> 00:01:34.976
LET'S ALL
TAKE HER OUT TONIGHT.

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:37.178
THERE'S LOTS OF GREAT PLACES
TO MEET PEOPLE.

00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:38.458
THE FEDERAL SEX BUREAU.

00:01:38.482 --> 00:01:40.148
A SAUCY PUPPET SHOW.

00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:42.433
THE ROTTING CARCASS
OF A WHALE.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.252
MMM... I'LL PICK.

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:53.978
OH, WOW, IT'S TOTALLY RETRO.

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:56.147
WHY'S EVERYONE
WEARING THOSE RINGS?

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.750
GUH. BECAUSE NOBODY
WEARS THEM ANYMORE.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.235
RINGS ARE STUPID.

00:02:00.303 --> 00:02:01.769
I THINK THEY LOOK COOL.

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:04.121
SHH! DON'T LET ANYONE
HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.618
HEY, DID THAT
LAD JUST SAY
RINGS ARE COOL?

00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:08.421
NOPE. HE SAID
THEY'RE STUPID.

00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:09.445
COOL!

00:02:11.347 --> 00:02:13.659
SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THAT
GUY BY THE BAR?

00:02:13.683 --> 00:02:15.082
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:16.718
FORGET IT. HE'S GAY.

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:18.620
WHAT? HOW CAN YOU TELL?

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.272
I JUST KNOW THESE THINGS.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.323
I'VE GOT
WHAT THEY CALL "GAYDAR."

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:23.824
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:25.226
NO?

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.600
OKAY...
I GOT A LOCK ON HIM.

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.134
YUP. HE'S GAY.

00:02:34.203 --> 00:02:36.270
ARE YOU SURE?
DEFINITELY.

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.524
UNLESS I'M GETTING INTERFERENCE
FROM A GAY WEATHER BALLOON.

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:41.292
YOU'RE FROM THE 20th CENTURY?

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.195
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
I'M FROM THE 21st CENTURY.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.708
NO WAY. WE'VE GOT
SO MUCH IN COMMON.

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:48.249
WE SURE DO.

00:02:48.317 --> 00:02:51.235
REMEMBER WHEN THOSE CYBORGS
ENSLAVED HUMANITY?

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:54.205
UH... YEAH.
THAT RINGS A BELL.

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:56.140
THIS IS BOLT ROLLINS.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.926
BOLT IS A HYPER-SLED RACER

00:02:57.994 --> 00:03:00.378
WITH TEN WINS ON
THE PRO CIRCUIT.

00:03:00.447 --> 00:03:02.313
HELLO, BEAUTIFUL.

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:05.566
I THINK SHE MEANS
TEN WINS ON THE<i> GAY</i> CIRCUIT.

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:07.118
I WISH.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.170
THOSE CATS
CAN REALLY FLY.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:29.590
THIS IS M-5438,
AN ENTITY OF PURE ENERGY.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.009
THAT'S GREAT

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:33.712
REALLY, BUT HE'S JUST NOT
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.474
I UNDERSTAND.

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:38.299
ONE DAY YOU WILL EVOLVE
BEYOND YOUR PHYSICAL BODY

00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:39.584
AND ON THAT DAY

00:03:39.653 --> 00:03:41.786
I HOPE YOU WILL
PICK UP THE PHONE.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:43.599
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE.

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:45.873
IT'S JUST AS WELL.

00:03:45.942 --> 00:03:48.042
I THINK HE COMES
FROM A DIMENSION

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:50.445
THAT'S BIG ON MUSICAL THEATER.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:59.454
PSST. I NEED
THE APARTMENT TONIGHT.

00:03:59.523 --> 00:04:01.222
GO SEE A SAUCY PUPPET SHOW.

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:03.090
CAN DO!

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.998
MY, MY, MY, WHAT'S
A BEAUTIFUL LADY LIKE YOU...

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:11.315
OH! WHA... WAH!

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:14.001
I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT
YOU HAD TWO EYES.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.986
<i>SO, LEELA</i>

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:18.256
YOU MUST'VE HAD
YOUR PICK OF THE LITTER

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:20.091
LAST NIGHT AT CLOSING TIME.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.622
COULD YOU GUYS PLEASE
STOP TALKING ABOUT
MY PERSONAL LIFE?

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:26.514
YES. LET'S ALL TALK ABOUT
LEELA'S PERSONAL LIFE LATER.

00:04:26.582 --> 00:04:28.916
BUT RIGHT NOW,
WE HAVE BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.

00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:30.200
A DELIVERY?

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:34.105
NO. A TAX-DEDUCTIBLE
MISSION OF CHARITY.

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:36.390
This is Vergon 6.

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:39.343
- THIS IS VERGON 6.
- BUH.

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:42.013
IT'S A SUNNY LITTLE
DOOMED PLANET

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.982
INHABITED BY A NUMBER
OF FRISKY LITTLE DOOMED ANIMALS.

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.134
ANIMALS?

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:47.351
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.537
ANIMALS IN DESPERATE NEED
OF RESCUE.

00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:51.584
YOU SEE, VERGON 6
WAS ONCE FILLED

00:04:51.608 --> 00:04:53.486
WITH THE SUPER-DENSE
SUBSTANCE

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.876
KNOWN AS DARK MATTER

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:56.511
EACH POUND OF WHICH

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.714
WEIGHS OVER 10,000 POUNDS.

00:04:59.783 --> 00:05:02.183
WAIT. WHAT ABOUT
THE ANIMALS?

00:05:02.252 --> 00:05:06.054
WELL, DARK MATTER IS EXTREMELY
VALUABLE AS STARSHIP FUEL.

00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:07.950
THAT'S WHY IT WAS
ALL MINED OUT

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.136
LEAVING THE PLANET
COMPLETELY HOLLOW.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.259
YES, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ANIMALS?

00:05:12.328 --> 00:05:13.328
THE WHAT?

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.562
THE ANIMALS.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.491
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT ANIMALS.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:19.550
NOW, IT SEEMS THE PLANET
WILL COLLAPSE WITHIN THREE DAYS.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:20.568
INCIDENTALLY

00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:22.603
THIS WILL KILL ALL THE ANIMALS.

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:25.034
SO WE HAVE TO BRING
BACK TWO OF EACH KIND...

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.338
JUST LIKE NOAH'S ARK.

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:27.442
WHY TWO?

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:29.528
OH.

00:05:35.018 --> 00:05:38.169
I BET YOU LEELA'S HOLDING OUT
FOR A NICE GUY WITH ONE EYE.

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:39.353
THAT'LL TAKE FOREVER.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:40.521
WHAT SHE OUGHT TO DO

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.318
IS FIND A NICE GUY
WITH TWO EYES

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:43.624
AND POKE ONE OUT.

00:05:43.693 --> 00:05:45.676
YEAH. THAT'D BE A TIME-SAVER.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:46.828
DO YOU MIND?

00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:47.962
HERE YOU GO.

00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:49.948
YOU CAN USE THIS
AS AN EYE POKER.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.594
THANK YOU, BUT
I DON'T CARE

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:53.079
HOW MANY EYES
A MAN HAS.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:54.702
AS LONG AS IT'S LESS THAN FIVE.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.020
ALL I'M LOOKING FOR

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:58.168
IS A GUY WHO'S ADVENTUROUS,
SELF-CONFIDENT

00:05:58.207 --> 00:05:59.941
<i>MAYBE A SNAPPY DRESSER.</i>

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.654
<i>THESE NEW UNIFORMS</i>

00:06:01.678 --> 00:06:03.862
ARE PRETTY SNAPPY,
EH, FIRST OFFICER?

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.413
I SUPPOSE, CAPTAIN.

00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:08.149
I'M NOT AS BIG A FAN OF VELOUR
AS YOU ARE.

00:06:08.218 --> 00:06:09.951
NOW, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:11.714
ABOUT THAT
UNIDENTIFIED SHIP?

00:06:11.738 --> 00:06:13.020
DESTROY THEM.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.690
MMM...

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:18.059
THAT'S GOT A NICE FEEL TO IT.

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:25.182
<i>STARDATE 3000.3.</i>

00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.135
<i>WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO, SIR?</i>

00:06:27.204 --> 00:06:28.470
YOU.

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.705
AREN'T YOU GETTING THIS?

00:06:30.774 --> 00:06:32.490
WE'VE DETECTED A VESSEL

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.393
ATTEMPTING TO BREAK
THE SECURITY CORDON

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:36.672
AROUND VERGON 6.

00:06:36.696 --> 00:06:39.864
I'M ANTICIPATING
AN ALL-OUT TACTICAL DOGFIGHT

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:41.866
FOLLOWED BY A LIGHT DINNER.

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:45.436
RAVIOLI, HAM, SUNDAE BAR.

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:46.538
HEY, LOOK.

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:48.706
THAT'S ZAPP BRANNIGAN'S SHIP.

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:50.508
WOW.<i> THE</i> ZAPP BRANNIGAN?

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:51.842
UH-HUH.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.661
WHO'S<i> THE</i> ZAPP BRANNIGAN?

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.147
SHALL I FIRE
ON THEM NOW, SIR?

00:06:56.216 --> 00:06:57.481
NOT YET, KIF.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.795
IN THE GAME OF CHESS

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.152
YOU CAN NEVER LET YOUR
ADVERSARY SEE YOUR PIECES.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.654
WHAT?

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:06.307
THEY SAY ZAPP BRANNIGAN
SINGLE-HANDEDLY SAVED

00:07:06.376 --> 00:07:09.694
THE OCTILLIAN SYSTEM FROM
A HORDE OF RAMPAGING KILLBOTS.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.040
WOW.

00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:13.631
A GRIM DAY
FOR ROBOTKIND.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.150
BUT WE CAN ALWAYS BUILD
MORE KILLBOTS.

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:17.902
HE'S THE MOST DECORATED CAPTAIN

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:20.204
IN THE WHOLE DEMOCRATIC ORDER
OF PLANETS.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.151
LEELA'S GOT A BOYFRIEND.

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:24.642
NO, I DON'T, BUT I THINK
WE OUGHT TO MEET WITH HIM

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:26.978
AND SEE IF HE'LL HELP US
RESCUE THOSE ANIMALS.

00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:28.462
JUST IN CASE
YOU GUYS HIT IT OFF

00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:30.064
YOU'LL WANT TO TAKE THIS
WITH YOU.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.187
SIR, THEY'RE HEADED
STRAIGHT FOR US.

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:37.538
A WELL-CALCULATED MOVE.

00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:39.841
STRAIGHT OUT OF
SUN TZU'S CLASSIC TEXT...

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.187
<i>THE ART OF WAR.</i>

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.354
OR MY OWN MASTERWORK...

00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.207
<i>ZAPP BRANNIGAN'S
BIG BOOK OF WAR.</i>

00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:46.564
BUT THE ONE THING
THEIR CAPTAIN DOESN'T REALIZE

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:47.865
AND NEVER WILL IS...

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:50.568
SIR, THEY'VE DOCKED WITH US
AND HAVE COME ABOARD.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.282
THEN I'VE RISKED
ALL AND LOST.

00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:54.433
KIF, OLD MAN, I'LL BE
IN THE ESCAPE POD.

00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:57.308
IF THAT WICKER CHAIR I LIKE
SURVIVES THE SLAUGHTER

00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:59.010
HAVE IT SENT TO MY P.O. BOX.

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:03.981
HELLO, I'M LEELA

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.518
CAPTAIN OF THE PLANET EXPRESS
DELIVERY SHIP.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:09.587
WE'VE COME ABOARD
TO PLEAD FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.239
WELL, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING...

00:08:11.307 --> 00:08:12.524
I'M IN COMMAND HERE.

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:13.825
ZAPP BRANNIGAN.

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:16.611
HAS MY FAME PRECEDED ME,
OR WAS I TOO QUICK FOR IT?

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.929
OH, NOT AT ALL.

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:19.497
I'M JUST SO, UH...

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:21.911
REALLY THRILLED
TO MEET YOU.

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:24.385
YOU'RE AN IMPRESSIVE
PIECE OF CAPTAIN.

00:08:24.454 --> 00:08:25.854
BEAUTIFUL AND DEADLY.

00:08:25.923 --> 00:08:27.321
A POTENT COMBINATION.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.723
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:30.158
BUT I DO.

00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:32.304
I DOUBT I'VE SEEN MORE THAN
THREE OR FOUR CAPTAINS

00:08:32.328 --> 00:08:35.947
SEXIER THAN YOU...
AND ONLY ONE WHO WAS DEADLIER.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:38.227
I HEARD YOU
SINGLE-HANDEDLY
DEFEATED A HORDE

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:41.385
OF RAMPAGING SOMETHINGS IN
THE SOMETHING SOMETHING SYSTEM.

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:42.820
THE KILLBOTS? A TRIFLE.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:45.523
IT WAS SIMPLY A MATTER
OF OUTSMARTING THEM.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.792
WOW, I NEVER WOULD
HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.261
YOU SEE, KILLBOTS HAVE
A PRESET KILL LIMIT.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.595
KNOWING THEIR WEAKNESS

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:54.032
I SENT WAVE AFTER WAVE
OF MY OWN MEN AT THEM

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.534
UNTIL THEY REACHED THEIR LIMIT
AND SHUT DOWN.

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:59.588
KIF, SHOW THEM
THE MEDAL I WON.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.591
MORE, PLEASE.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.942
A LITTLE MORE.

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.277
MORE.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.585
KEEP GOING.

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:09.330
CAPTAIN BRANNIGAN,
WE REALLY NEED

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:11.149
TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT OUR MISSION.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.196
WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M WILLING TO PUT

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.503
WAVE AFTER WAVE OF MEN
AT YOUR DISPOSAL.

00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:16.755
RIGHT, MEN?

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:18.372
YOU SUCK!

00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:21.742
WE'RE HOPING TO SAVE THE ANIMALS
OF VERGON 6 FROM EXTINCTION.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:25.296
VERGON 6?
THIS LIGHT DINNER IS OVER.

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:26.464
WAIT. WHAT'S WRONG?

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:29.011
THE DEMOCRATIC ORDER
OF PLANETS PROHIBITS

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:31.180
INTERFERING WITH
UNDEVELOPED WORLDS.

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:32.637
IT'S A LITTLE RULE KNOWN

00:09:32.706 --> 00:09:34.138
AS "BRANNIGAN'S LAW."

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:36.274
BUT PEOPLE ALREADY
INTERFERED.

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:38.793
THAT PLANET WAS MINED
COMPLETELY HOLLOW.

00:09:38.862 --> 00:09:42.030
YES, BY A DEMOCRATIC ORDER
OF PLANETS MINING CREW.

00:09:42.098 --> 00:09:44.515
THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.318
I DON'T PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND
BRANNIGAN'S LAW.

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:48.586
I MERELY ENFORCE IT.

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:51.355
FINE. WE'LL SAVE THE ANIMALS
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.907
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T ALLOW THAT.

00:09:52.976 --> 00:09:54.308
GUARDS.

00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:56.727
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:58.707
HE'S THROWING US
IN PRISON.

00:09:58.731 --> 00:09:59.981
DANG.

00:10:00.067 --> 00:10:02.348
CAN I GET THIS
WRAPPED UP?

00:10:04.387 --> 00:10:05.753
OW!

00:10:05.822 --> 00:10:07.939
I MIGHT HAVE LIKED
ZAPP BRANNIGAN

00:10:08.008 --> 00:10:09.908
IF HE WEREN'T
A POMPOUS DIMWIT

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:11.409
WHO THREW ME
IN PRISON.

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:13.122
YOU REALLY ARE
TOO PICKY.

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:16.030
KIF, FOLLOW ME UP
TO THE OBSERVATION DECK.

00:10:16.099 --> 00:10:17.949
I'VE GOT SOME MUSING TO DO.

00:10:19.903 --> 00:10:21.235
OH, GEEZ.

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:25.556
I'M FACING A FORMIDABLE
FEMALE ADVERSARY, KIF.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.858
SUGGESTIONS?

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:29.477
I FAIL TO SEE
ANY PROBLEM, SIR.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.747
YOU ALREADY IMPRISONED HER
UNDER DIRECTIVE B10.81.

00:10:32.815 --> 00:10:34.865
YOU MEAN BRANNIGAN'S LAW?

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:36.918
RIGHT. THAT LAW.

00:10:36.987 --> 00:10:38.269
WHICH ONE?

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:41.089
BRANNIGAN'S LAW.

00:10:41.158 --> 00:10:43.341
KIF, YOU'RE MY BEST
AND MOST LOYAL FRIEND

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.460
BUT YOU'VE EARNED
MY CONTEMPT ONCE AGAIN.

00:10:45.528 --> 00:10:47.312
AS MY PROTÉGÉ,
YOU SHOULD KNOW

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.031
THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DEAL
WITH A FEMALE ADVERSARY

00:10:50.099 --> 00:10:51.365
IS TO SEDUCE HER.

00:10:51.434 --> 00:10:52.884
OH.

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:55.386
THIS TIME WE ARE SURE
SHE'S A WOMAN, RIGHT?

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:56.771
YES.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.856
GOOD. INVITE HER
TO MY QUARTERS.

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:01.842
OH, AND HAVE THE BOY
LAY OUT MY FORMAL SHORTS.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.211
THE BOY, SIR?

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.265
YOU. YOU LAY OUT
MY FORMAL SHORTS.

00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:10.785
THE JACKASS WANTS
TO SEE YOU IN
HIS QUARTERS.

00:11:10.854 --> 00:11:12.153
GOOD.

00:11:12.222 --> 00:11:14.488
THIS WILL BE MY CHANCE
TO REASON WITH HIM

00:11:14.557 --> 00:11:16.157
CAPTAIN TO CAPTAIN.

00:11:16.226 --> 00:11:18.666
AND HE WANTS YOU
TO WEAR THIS.

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:22.213
COME AND GET IT.

00:11:23.967 --> 00:11:26.150
WELCOME TO MY
HUMBLE CHAMBER

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:27.452
OR AS I CALL IT

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.137
THE LOVE-NASIUM.

00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:31.755
CHAM-PAG-EN?

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:34.759
I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE SUCH
A COIN-A-SEWER.

00:11:34.828 --> 00:11:36.660
WELL, I HAVE STUDIED ABROAD...

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:37.995
OR TWO.

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:42.928
- CAPTAIN...
- UH-HUH?

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.947
IF WE COULD SPEAK
SERIOUSLY FOR A MOMENT.

00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:46.771
- UH-HUH.
- I'D LIKE YOU TO RECONSIDER

00:11:46.823 --> 00:11:48.434
LETTING US
RESCUE THOSE ANIMALS.

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:50.758
MM-HMM.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.666
I LIKE YOUR STYLE.

00:11:58.735 --> 00:12:00.368
I FIND IT VERY...

00:12:00.437 --> 00:12:02.253
EROTIC.

00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:04.121
WHAT?
EROTIC!

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.858
EROTIC! EROTIC! EROTIC!

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.846
WE CAN DEFINITELY
ESCAPE, BENDER.

00:12:11.915 --> 00:12:14.715
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BEND
THE HATCH OFF THIS STEAM PIPE.

00:12:14.784 --> 00:12:16.100
HEY, YEAH.

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:22.490
NO GOOD. IT'S FULL OF STEAM.

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:26.444
YOU LOOK LIKE A WOMAN
WHO ENJOYS THE FINER THINGS.

00:12:26.513 --> 00:12:29.747
COME OVER HERE
AND FEEL MY VELOUR BEDSPREAD.

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:31.599
I'M NOT REALLY IN THE MOOD.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.901
LEELA, IT'S REAL VELOUR.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.987
JUST LET YOURSELF GO.

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.691
CAN I PLEASE JUST GO BACK
TO PRISON?

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.337
YOU'D RATHER SIT
IN PRISON

00:12:41.361 --> 00:12:43.811
THAN SPEND ONE EVENING
WITH THE ZAPPER?

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.546
MUCH RATHER.

00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:50.935
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:52.920
OH, GOD, I'M PATHETIC.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.857
SORRY.

00:12:55.925 --> 00:12:57.191
JUST GO.

00:12:57.259 --> 00:12:59.227
YOU WANT THE REST
OF THE CHAM-PAG-EN?

00:12:59.296 --> 00:13:02.363
NO. AND IT'S PRONOUNCED
"CHAMPAGNE."

00:13:02.432 --> 00:13:03.915
OH, GOD, NO!

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:06.583
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:08.719
I GET SO LONELY.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:12.439
I JUST THOUGHT YOU,
A FELLOW CAPTAIN,
WOULD UNDERSTAND.

00:13:12.508 --> 00:13:13.708
AW, FORGET IT.

00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:16.744
YEAH, IT'S GREAT ORDERING
PEOPLE AROUND AND STUFF

00:13:16.812 --> 00:13:19.597
BUT THROUGH IT ALL,
YOU'RE COMPLETELY ALONE.

00:13:19.666 --> 00:13:21.949
IT COMES WITH THE JOB.

00:13:22.018 --> 00:13:24.418
I'M JUST SO LONELY!

00:13:26.823 --> 00:13:29.023
OH, COME ON.
CHEER UP.

00:13:29.091 --> 00:13:31.008
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

00:13:31.077 --> 00:13:33.461
YOU WANT TO TRY ESCAPING AGAIN?

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:34.729
NAH, I'M COMFY.

00:13:34.797 --> 00:13:36.992
MAN, LEELA'S BEEN
GONE A LONG TIME.

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:39.317
I HOPE SHE'S AT LEAST
MAKING PROGRESS

00:13:39.386 --> 00:13:40.685
WITH ZAPP BRANNIGAN.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.416
GOOD MORNING, LOVER.

00:13:55.485 --> 00:13:57.001
UH... LISTEN, ZAPP...

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.215
NOW YOU'RE
OFFICIALLY
MY WOMAN.

00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:00.171
KUDOS.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.873
I CAN'T SAY I DON'T ENVY YOU.

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:04.158
ZAPP, LAST NIGHT WAS A MISTAKE.

00:14:04.227 --> 00:14:05.693
A SEXY MISTAKE.

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.962
NO, JUST
A REGULAR MISTAKE.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.147
FOR A SPLIT SECOND

00:14:09.216 --> 00:14:11.666
MY COMMON SENSE
WAS OVERWHELMED BY PITY.

00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:14.814
A SPLIT SECOND
IS ALL IT TAKES.

00:14:14.838 --> 00:14:15.948
THAT'S WHY
SOONER OR LATER

00:14:15.972 --> 00:14:17.683
YOU'LL COME CRAWLING
BACK TO THE ZAPPER.

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:22.459
THE ONLY KIND OF CRAWLING
I'M DOING TO YOU IS AWAY...

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:23.994
FROM.

00:14:24.063 --> 00:14:27.182
LEELA, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
CONFUSED AND AROUSED.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.011
LOOK, I'M GOING DOWN
TO VERGON 6

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.836
TO SAVE THOSE ANIMALS
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:33.271
GO AHEAD. I WON'T STOP YOU.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.789
THREATEN ALL YOU...

00:14:34.858 --> 00:14:36.224
WAIT. WHAT?

00:14:36.293 --> 00:14:39.227
WE BOTH KNOW YOU WON'T MAKE IT
HALFWAY TO VERGON 6

00:14:39.296 --> 00:14:40.894
BEFORE THE CRAVING SETS IN.

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:42.875
THEN YOU'LL COME
CRAWLING BACK

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:46.751
FOR ANOTHER TASTE
OF SWEET, SWEET CANDY.

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:48.119
BAM.

00:14:48.188 --> 00:14:49.804
UGH.

00:14:52.241 --> 00:14:53.241
KIF.

00:14:53.276 --> 00:14:54.792
YES... UGH.

00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:56.694
YES, CAPTAIN?

00:14:56.763 --> 00:14:58.941
I HAVE MADE IT
WITH A WOMAN.

00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:00.205
INFORM THE MEN.

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:05.770
THE FATSO SAYS
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:07.105
REALLY? WHY?

00:15:07.173 --> 00:15:08.122
WHY INDEED?

00:15:08.191 --> 00:15:09.924
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:11.458
NOTHING.

00:15:11.527 --> 00:15:14.395
SO, SHOULD WE GET OUR STUFF
AND HEAD DOWN TO THE PLANET?

00:15:14.463 --> 00:15:16.543
WE JUST TALKED,
OKAY?

00:15:26.376 --> 00:15:27.887
ALL RIGHT, WE DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME

00:15:27.911 --> 00:15:29.255
TO COLLECT
THESE ANIMALS.

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:31.657
THE PLANET IS SUPPOSED TO
COLLAPSE IN APPROXIMATELY...

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:32.980
TWO HOURS AGO.

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:38.297
LOOKING FOR A SNAKE.
LOOKING FOR A SNAKE.

00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:07.214
HELLO THERE.

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:16.357
HMM, HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE ON THE CHECKLIST.

00:16:16.426 --> 00:16:18.125
SO YOU'RE SAYING
WE CAN COOK HIM?

00:16:18.194 --> 00:16:19.343
YEAH, BARBECUE.

00:16:19.412 --> 00:16:20.711
I'LL WEAR MY
HILARIOUS APRON.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.996
NO.

00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:24.043
I DON'T CARE HOW HILARIOUS
YOUR APRON IS.

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:25.183
WE'RE NOT COOKING HIM.

00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:27.585
AW.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.687
I'LL CALL HIM NIBBLER.

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:31.239
AW.

00:16:31.307 --> 00:16:33.540
I'LL FIRE UP THE GRILL.

00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:35.275
I HOPE HE'LL BE OKAY
IN THERE

00:16:35.344 --> 00:16:36.978
WITH ALL THOSE
BIG ANIMALS.

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:56.358
HMM.

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:58.449
YOU KNOW, KIF,
ONCE MY WOMAN RETURNS

00:16:58.518 --> 00:16:59.783
I WON'T HAVE MUCH TIME

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.830
TO HANG OUT WITH
THE BOYS ANYMORE.

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:03.020
THAT'S A SHAME, SIR.

00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:05.590
SO LET'S MAKE THE MOST
OF OUR TIME TOGETHER

00:17:05.658 --> 00:17:07.725
SHALL WE?

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:08.926
NEVER MIND.

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.495
JUST GIVE ME
A BACK RUB.

00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:13.564
I FOUND A PAIR
OF "HERMAPHLAMINGOS."

00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:15.473
GOOD. THAT'S
THE LAST SPECIES.

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:17.863
HUH?
HUH?
HUH?

00:17:17.887 --> 00:17:19.337
HEY, WHAT THE...

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:20.705
WHERE'D
THEY ALL GO?

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:28.779
NIBBLER!

00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:30.664
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE FLEW HALFWAY

00:17:30.733 --> 00:17:32.983
ACROSS THE GALAXY
AND ENJOYED A STEAM

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.136
JUST TO GET LUNCH
FOR THAT STUPID ANIMAL.

00:17:35.205 --> 00:17:36.988
HE'S PENDING FOR A BENDING.

00:17:39.676 --> 00:17:40.725
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:41.859
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT

00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:43.572
HE'S AN UNSTOPPABLE
KILLING MACHINE.

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:45.263
IS IT, SNUGGUMS?

00:17:46.615 --> 00:17:48.983
THE PLANET'S
"KERPLODING."

00:17:55.558 --> 00:17:56.874
PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF.

00:17:58.594 --> 00:17:59.744
WE'RE OUT OF FUEL.

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:02.112
BENDER, I TOLD YOU
TO FILL THE TANK

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:03.181
BEFORE WE LEFT.

00:18:03.232 --> 00:18:05.933
YEAH, I'LL DO IT
WHEN WE GET BACK.

00:18:07.804 --> 00:18:10.804
MAN, LUCKY FOR US
ZAPP BRANNIGAN'S NEARBY.

00:18:10.873 --> 00:18:12.039
NO WAY. FORGET IT.

00:18:12.108 --> 00:18:14.408
I REFUSE TO GO CRAWLING
BACK TO HIM.

00:18:14.477 --> 00:18:16.527
WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.095
NOTHING. WE JUST TALKED.

00:18:18.164 --> 00:18:19.246
SO WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

00:18:19.315 --> 00:18:21.195
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU SLEPT WITH HIM.

00:18:25.572 --> 00:18:28.756
OH, MY GOD!

00:18:28.824 --> 00:18:30.408
OH, HOW COULD
YOU, LEELA?

00:18:30.476 --> 00:18:32.576
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
SOME STANDARDS.

00:18:32.645 --> 00:18:35.245
I MEAN, GEEZ, HE'S
A DUMB GROSS GORILLA.

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:36.564
THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:18:36.633 --> 00:18:38.544
DON'T YOU THINK I FEEL
BAD ENOUGH ALREADY?

00:18:38.568 --> 00:18:39.767
NO.

00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:44.405
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL CALL HIM.

00:18:44.474 --> 00:18:47.625
I MEAN, IF LIVING IS
THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU.

00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:50.862
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'LL
NEVER MAKE CAPTAIN, KIF.

00:18:50.914 --> 00:18:52.547
HMM.

00:18:52.615 --> 00:18:53.947
Hello, Zapp?

00:18:54.016 --> 00:18:55.917
WELL, WELL, WELL.

00:18:55.985 --> 00:18:58.202
ZAPP, WE'RE OUT OF FUEL.

00:18:58.271 --> 00:19:00.032
And Vergon 6
is about to implode.

00:19:00.056 --> 00:19:01.489
We need your help.

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:05.526
SO CRAWLING BACK TO THE BIG "Z"
LIKE A BIRD ON ITS BELLY.

00:19:05.595 --> 00:19:07.194
DELICIOUS.

00:19:07.263 --> 00:19:08.695
Birds don't crawl.

00:19:08.764 --> 00:19:10.164
THEY'VE BEEN KNOWN TO.

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.767
LOOK, ARE YOU GOING
TO RESCUE US OR NOT?

00:19:12.836 --> 00:19:15.219
Can't you ask
a little more sexfully?

00:19:17.807 --> 00:19:20.108
PLEASE...

00:19:20.176 --> 00:19:21.925
Big Z.

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.394
CERTAINLY.

00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:25.557
BUT FIRST YOU'LL HAVE
TO GET RID OF THAT THING.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.748
That's the law, Leela.

00:19:27.817 --> 00:19:30.601
AND BRANNIGAN'S LAW
IS LIKE BRANNIGAN'S LOVE...

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.119
HARD AND FAST.

00:19:32.188 --> 00:19:35.823
Now put that greasy rat outside
and we'll tow you to safety.

00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:38.759
I WOULD NEVER ABANDON
A HELPLESS ANIMAL.

00:19:38.828 --> 00:19:42.430
YOU KNOW, ZAPP, ONCE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A BIG, POMPOUS BUFFOON.

00:19:42.499 --> 00:19:45.850
THEN I REALIZED THAT INSIDE,
YOU WERE JUST A PITIFUL CHILD.

00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:48.185
BUT NOW I REALIZE
THAT OUTSIDE THAT CHILD

00:19:48.254 --> 00:19:49.670
IS A BIG, POMPOUS BUFFOON.

00:19:49.738 --> 00:19:52.523
And which one rocked your world?

00:19:54.543 --> 00:19:56.227
WOW, WAY TO TELL
THAT GUY OFF.

00:19:56.295 --> 00:19:58.262
NOW WHAT'S YOUR
SECRET ESCAPE PLAN?

00:19:58.331 --> 00:20:01.748
UH... I GUESS TO SIT HERE
AND WAIT FOR DEATH.

00:20:01.817 --> 00:20:03.984
CAN DO.

00:20:05.054 --> 00:20:07.214
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

00:20:10.326 --> 00:20:11.591
PHEW!

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.855
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

00:20:12.879 --> 00:20:14.278
IT'S DARK MATTER.

00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:16.864
SO THIS GUY JUST UNLOADED
A STEAMING PILE

00:20:16.932 --> 00:20:18.232
OF STARSHIP FUEL?

00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:21.702
HIS SPECIES MUST HAVE FILLED
THE ENTIRE PLANET WITH IT.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.671
DID YOU DO THAT,
YOU CUTE LITTLE...

00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:27.341
COME ON.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.942
THAT SHOULD BE MORE
THAN ENOUGH FUEL

00:20:29.012 --> 00:20:30.144
TO GET US OUT OF HERE.

00:20:30.213 --> 00:20:32.046
BENDER, PICK IT UP
AND PUT IT IN THE ENGINE.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.990
WE MADE IT!

00:21:00.043 --> 00:21:02.409
AND SOME
OF THE ANIMALS SURVIVED.

00:21:02.478 --> 00:21:04.245
SO A COUPLE OF ANIMALS

00:21:04.314 --> 00:21:06.831
DIDN'T DIE,
AND LEELA GOT LUCKY.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.134
THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A SUCCESSFUL MISSION.

00:21:10.203 --> 00:21:11.818
WE'RE HEROES!

00:21:11.887 --> 00:21:14.421
<i>DEAR CAPTAIN'S DIARY...</i>

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.208
<i>I MAY NOT HAVE FOUND LOVE
ON THIS MISSION</i>

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:19.744
<i>BUT I DID FIND
A CUTE LITTLE COMPANION</i>

00:21:19.812 --> 00:21:23.397
<i>WHO EXCRETES STARSHIP FUEL,
AND THAT'S JUST AS GOOD.</i>

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:30.688
<i>STARDATE, UH...</i>

00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:32.067
<i>APRIL 13.</i>

00:21:32.091 --> 00:21:34.842
<i>APRIL 13, POINT TWO.</i>

00:21:34.911 --> 00:21:37.644
WE HAVE FAILED TO UPHOLD
BRANNIGAN'S LAW.

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:40.747
HOWEVER, I DID MAKE IT
WITH A HOT ALIEN BABE.

00:21:40.816 --> 00:21:44.551
AND IN THE END, IS THAT NOT
WHAT MAN HAS DREAMT OF

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.421
SINCE FIRST HE LOOKED UP
AT THE STARS?

00:21:47.489 --> 00:21:49.856
KIF, I'M ASKING YOU
A QUESTION.
